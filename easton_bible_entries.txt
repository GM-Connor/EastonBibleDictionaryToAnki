A	<p>Alpha, the first letter of the Greek alphabet, as Omega is the last. These letters occur in the text of  Revelation 1:8 Revelation 1:11 ;  21:6 ;  22:13 , and are represented by "Alpha" and "Omega" respectively (omitted in RSV,  1:11 ). They mean "the first and last." (Compare  Hebrews 12:2 ;  Isaiah 41:4 ;  44:6 ;  Revelation 1:11 Revelation 1:17 ;  2:8 .) In the symbols of the early Christian Church these two letters are frequently combined with the cross or with Christ's monogram to denote his divinity.  </p>
Aaron	<p>the eldest son of Amram and Jochebed, a daughter of Levi ( Exodus 6:20 ). Some explain the name as meaning mountaineer, others mountain of strength, illuminator. He was born in Egypt three years before his brother Moses, and a number of years after his sister Miriam ( Exodus 2:1 Exodus 2:4 ;  7:7 ). He married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab of the house of Judah ( 6:23 ;  1 Chronicles 2:10 ), by whom he had four sons, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. When the time for the deliverance of Isarael out of Egypt drew nigh, he was sent by God ( Exodus 4:14 Exodus 4:27-30 ) to meet his long-absent brother, that he might co-operate with him in all that they were required to do in bringing about the Exodus. He was to be the "mouth" or "prophet" of Moses, i.e., was to speak for him, because he was a man of a ready utterance ( Exodus 7:1 Exodus 7:2 Exodus 7:9 Exodus 7:10 Exodus 7:19 ). He was faithful to his trust, and stood by Moses in all his interviews with Pharaoh.  </p><p> When the ransomed tribes fought their first battle with Amalek in Rephidim, Moses stood on a hill overlooking the scene of the conflict with the rod of God in his outstretched hand. On this occasion he was attended by Aaron and Hur, his sister's husband, who held up his wearied hands till Joshua and the chosen warriors of Israel gained the victory ( 17:8-13 ).  </p><p> Afterwards, when encamped before Sinai, and when Moses at the command of God ascended the mount to receive the tables of the law, Aaron and his two sons, Nadab and Abihu, along with seventy of the elders of Israel, were permitted to accompany him part of the way, and to behold afar off the manifestation of the glory of Israel's God ( Exodus 19:24 ;  24:9-11 ). While Moses remained on the mountain with God, Aaron returned unto the people; and yielding through fear, or ignorance, or instability of character, to their clamour, made unto them a golden calf, and set it up as an object of worship ( Exodus 32:4 ;  Psalms 106:19 ). On the return of Moses to the camp, Aaron was sternly rebuked by him for the part he had acted in this matter; but he interceded for him before God, who forgave his sin ( Deuteronomy 9:20 ).  </p><p> On the mount, Moses received instructions regarding the system of worship which was to be set up among the people; and in accordance therewith Aaron and his sons were consecrated to the priest's office ( Leviticus 8 ;  9 ). Aaron, as high priest, held henceforth the prominent place appertaining to that office.  </p><p> When Israel had reached Hazeroth, in "the wilderness of Paran," Aaron joined with his sister Miriam in murmuring against Moses, "because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married," probably after the death of Zipporah. But the Lord vindicated his servant Moses, and punished Miriam with leprosy ( Numbers 12 ). Aaron acknowledged his own and his sister's guilt, and at the intercession of Moses they were forgiven.  </p><p> Twenty years after this, when the children of Israel were encamped in the wilderness of Paran, Korah, Dathan, and Abiram conspired against Aaron and his sons; but a fearful judgment from God fell upon them, and they were destroyed, and the next day thousands of the people also perished by a fierce pestilence, the ravages of which were only stayed by the interposition of Aaron ( Numbers 16 ). That there might be further evidence of the divine appointment of Aaron to the priestly office, the chiefs of the tribes were each required to bring to Moses a rod bearing on it the name of his tribe. And these, along with the rod of Aaron for the tribe of Levi, were laid up overnight in the tabernacle, and in the morning it was found that while the other rods remained unchanged, that of Aaron "for the house of Levi" budded, blossomed, and yielded almonds ( Numbers 17:1-10 ). This rod was afterwards preserved in the tabernacle ( Hebrews 9:4 ) as a memorial of the divine attestation of his appointment to the priesthood.  </p><p> Aaron was implicated in the sin of his brother at Meribah ( Numbers 20:8-13 ), and on that account was not permitted to enter the Promised Land. When the tribes arrived at Mount Hor, "in the edge of the land of Edom," at the command of God Moses led Aaron and his son Eleazar to the top of that mountain, in the sight of all the people. There he stripped Aaron of his priestly vestments, and put them upon Eleazar; and there Aaron died on the top of the mount, being 123 years old ( Numbers 20:23-29 . Compare  Deuteronomy 10:6 ;  32:50 ), and was "gathered unto his people." The people, "even all the house of Israel," mourned for him thirty days. Of Aaron's sons two survived him, Eleazar, whose family held the high-priesthood till the time of Eli; and Ithamar, in whose family, beginning with Eli, the high-priesthood was held till the time of Solomon. Aaron's other two sons had been struck dead ( Leviticus 10:1 Leviticus 10:2 ) for the daring impiety of offering "strange fire" on the alter of incense.  </p><p> The Arabs still show with veneration the traditionary site of Aaron's grave on one of the two summits of Mount Hor, which is marked by a Mohammedan chapel. His name is mentioned in the Koran, and there are found in the writings of the rabbins many fabulous stories regarding him. </p><p> He was the first anointed priest. His descendants, "the house of Aaron," constituted the priesthood in general. In the time of David they were very numerous ( 1 Chronicles 12:27 ). The other branches of the tribe of Levi held subordinate positions in connection with the sacred office. Aaron was a type of Christ in his official character as the high priest. His priesthood was a "shadow of heavenly things," and was intended to lead the people of Israel to look forward to the time when "another priest" would arise "after the order of Melchizedek" ( Hebrews 6:20 ). (See MOSES)  </p>
Aaronites	<p>the descendants of Aaron, and therefore priests. Jehoiada, the father of Benaiah, led 3,700 Aaronites as "fighting men" to the support of David at Hebron ( 1 Chronicles 12:27 ). Eleazar ( Numbers 3:32 ), and at a later period Zadok ( 1 Chronicles 27:17 ), was their chief.  </p>
Abaddon	<p>destruction, the Hebrew name (equivalent to the Greek Apollyon, i.e., destroyer) of "the angel of the bottomless pit" ( Revelation 9:11 ). It is rendered "destruction" in  Job 28:22 ;  31:12 ;  26:6 ;  Proverbs 15:11 ;  27:20 . In the last three of these passages the Revised Version retains the word "Abaddon." We may regard this word as a personification of the idea of destruction, or as sheol, the realm of the dead.  </p>
Abagtha	<p>one of the seven eunuchs in Ahasuerus's court ( Esther 1:10 ;  2:21 ).  </p>
Abana	<p>stony (Heb. marg. "Amanah," perennial), the chief river of Damascus ( 2 Kings 5:12 ). Its modern name is Barada, the Chrysorrhoas, or "golden stream," of the Greeks. It rises in a cleft of the Anti-Lebanon range, about 23 miles north-west of Damascus, and after flowing southward for a little way parts into three smaller streams, the central one flowing through Damascus, and the other two on each side of the city, diffusing beauty and fertility where otherwise there would be barrenness.  </p>
Abarim	<p>regions beyond; i.e., on the east of Jordan, a mountain, or rather a mountain-chain, over against Jericho, to the east and south-east of the Dead Sea, in the land of Moab. From "the top of Pisgah", i.e., Mount Nebo (q.v.), one of its summits, Moses surveyed the Promised Land ( Deuteronomy 3:27 ;  32:49 ), and there he died ( Deuteronomy 34:1 Deuteronomy 34:5 ). The Israelites had one of their encampments in the mountains of Abarim ( Numbers 33:47 Numbers 33:48 ) after crossing the Arnon.  </p>
Abba	<p>This Syriac or Chaldee word is found three times in the New Testament ( Mark 14:36 ;  Romans 8:15 ;  Galatians 4:6 ), and in each case is followed by its Greek equivalent, which is translated "father." It is a term expressing warm affection and filial confidence. It has no perfect equivalent in our language. It has passed into European languages as an ecclesiastical term, "abbot."  </p>
Abda	<p>servant. </p><li> The father of Adoniram, whom Solomon set over the tribute ( 1 Kings 4:6 ); i.e., the forced labour (RSV, "levy").  </li><li> A Levite of the family of Jeduthun ( Nehemiah 11:17 ), also called Obadiah ( 1 Chronicles 9:16 ).   </li>
Abdeel	<p>servant of God, ( Jeremiah 36:26 ), the father of Shelemiah.  </p>
Abdi	<p>my servant. </p><li> 1 Chronicles 6:44 . </li><li> 2 Chronicles 29:12 . </li><li> Ezra 10:26 .   </li>
Abdiel	<p>servant of God, ( 1 Chronicles 5:15 ), a Gadite chief.  </p>
Abdon	<p>servile. </p><li> The son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, the tenth judge of Israel ( Judges 12:13-15 ). He is probably the Bedan of  1 Samuel 12:11 .  </li><li> The first-born of Gibeon of the tribe of Benjamin ( 1 Chronicles 8:30 ;  9:36 ).  </li><li> The son of Micah, one of those whom Josiah sent to the prophetess Huldah to ascertain from her the meaning of the recently discovered book of the law ( 2 Chronicles 34:20 ). He is called Achbor in  2 Kings 22:12 .  </li><li> One of the "sons" of Shashak ( 1 Chronicles 8:23 ).  <p> This is the name also of a Levitical town of the Gershonites, in the tribe of Asher ( Joshua 21:30 ;  1 Chronicles 6:74 ). The ruins of Abdeh, some 8 miles north-east of Accho, probably mark its site.  </p> </li>
Abednego	<p>servant of Nego=Nebo, the Chaldee name given to Azariah, one of Daniel's three companions ( Daniel 2:49 ). With Shadrach and Meshach, he was delivered from the burning fiery furnace ( 3:12-30 ).  </p>
Abel	<p>(Heb. Hebhel), a breath, or vanity, the second son of Adam and Eve. He was put to death by his brother Cain ( Genesis 4:1-16 ). Guided by the instruction of their father, the two brothers were trained in the duty of worshipping God. "And in process of time" (marg. "at the end of days", i.e., on the Sabbath) each of them offered up to God of the first-fruits of his labours. Cain, as a husbandman, offered the fruits of the field; Abel, as a shepherd, of the firstlings of his flock. "The Lord had respect unto Abel and his offering; but unto Cain and his offering he had not respect" ( Genesis 4:3-5 ). On this account Cain was angry with his brother, and formed the design of putting him to death; a design which he at length found an opportunity of carrying into effect ( Genesis 4:8 Genesis 4:9 . Compare  1 John 3:12 ). There are several references to Abel in the New Testament. Our Saviour speaks of him as "righteous" ( Matthew 23:35 ). "The blood of sprinkling" is said to speak "better things than that of Abel" ( Hebrews 12:24 ); i.e., the blood of Jesus is the reality of which the blood of the offering made by Abel was only the type. The comparison here is between the sacrifice offered by Christ and that offered by Abel, and not between the blood of Christ calling for mercy and the blood of the murdered Abel calling for vengeance, as has sometimes been supposed. It is also said ( Hebrews 11:4 ) that "Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain." This sacrifice was made "by faith;" this faith rested in God, not only as the Creator and the God of providence, but especially in God as the great Redeemer, whose sacrifice was typified by the sacrifices which, no doubt by the divine institution, were offered from the days of Adam downward. On account of that "faith" which looked forward to the great atoning sacrifice, Abel's offering was accepted of God. Cain's offering had no such reference, and therefore was rejected. Abel was the first martyr, as he was the first of our race to die.  </p><p> Abel (Heb. 'abhel), lamentation ( 1 Samuel 6:18 ), the name given to the great stone in Joshua's field whereon the ark was "set down." The Revised Version, however, following the Targum and the LXX., reads in the Hebrew text <i> 'ebhen</i> (= a stone), and accordingly translates "unto the great stone, whereon they set down the ark." This reading is to be preferred. </p><p> Abel (Heb. 'abhel), a grassy place, a meadow. This word enters into the composition of the following five entries: </p>
Abel-beth-maachah	<p>meadow of the house of Maachah, a city in the north of Palestine, in the neighbourhood of Dan and Ijon, in the tribe of Naphtali. It was a place of considerable strength and importance. It is called a "mother in Israel", i.e., a metropolis ( 2 Samuel 20:19 ). It was besieged by Joab ( 2 Samuel 20:14 ), by Benhadad ( 1 Kings 15:20 ), and by Tiglath-pileser ( 2 Kings 15:29 ) about B.C. 734. It is elsewhere called Abel-maim, meadow of the waters, ( 2 Chronicles 16:4 ). Its site is occupied by the modern Abil or Abil-el-kamh, on a rising ground to the east of the brook Derdarah, which flows through the plain of Huleh into the Jordan, about 6 miles to the west-north-west of Dan.  </p>
Abel-cheramim	<p>( Judges 11:33 , RSV; A. V., "plain of the vineyards"), a village of the Ammonites, whither Jephthah pursued their forces.  </p>
Abel-meholah	<p>meadow of dancing, or the dancing-meadow, the birth-place and residence of the prophet Elisha, not far from Beth-shean ( 1 Kings 4:12 ), in the tribe of Issachar, near where the Wady el-Maleh emerges into the valley of the Jordan, "the rich meadow-land which extends about 4 miles south of Beth-shean; moist and luxuriant." Here Elisha was found at his plough by Elijah on his return up the Jordan valley from Horeb ( 1 Kings 19:16 ). It is now called 'Ain Helweh.  </p>
Abel-mizraim	<p>meadow of Egypt, or mourning of Egypt, a place "beyond," i.e., on the west of Jordan, at the "threshing-floor of Atad." Here the Egyptians mourned seventy days for Jacob ( Genesis 50:4-11 ). Its site is unknown.  </p>
Abel-shittim	<p>meadow of the acacias, frequently called simply "Shittim" ( Numbers 25:1 ;  Joshua 2:1 ;  Micah 6:5 ), a place on the east of Jordan, in the plain of Moab, nearly opposite Jericho. It was the forty-second encampment of the Israelites, their last resting-place before they crossed the Jordan ( Numbers 33:49 ;  22:1 ;  26:3 ;  31:12 ; comp  25:1 ;  31:16 ).  </p>
Abez	<p>tin, or white, a town in the tribe of Issachar ( Joshua 19:20 ), at the north of the plain of Esdraelon. It is probably identified with the ruins of el-Beida.  </p>
Abia	<p>my father is the Lord, the Greek form of Abijah, or Abijam ( Matthew 1:7 ), instead of Abiah ( 1 Chronicles 7:8 ). In  Luke 1:5 , the name refers to the head of the eighth of the twenty-four courses into which David divided the priests ( 1 Chronicles 24:10 ).  </p>
Abi-albon	<p>father of strength; i.e., "valiant", one of David's body-guard of thirty mighty men ( 2 Samuel 23:31 ); called also Abiel ( 1 Chronicles 11:32 ).  </p>
Abiasaph	<p>father of gathering; the gatherer, the youngest of the three sons of Korah the Levite, head of a family of Korhites ( Exodus 6:24 ); called Ebisaph ( 1 Chronicles 6:37 ).  </p>
Abiathar	<p>father of abundance, or my father excels, the son of Ahimelech the high priest. He was the tenth high priest, and the fourth in descent from Eli. When his father was slain with the priests of Nob, he escaped, and bearing with him the ephod, he joined David, who was then in the cave of Adullam ( 1 Samuel 22:20-23 ;  23:6 ). He remained with David, and became priest of the party of which he was the leader ( 1 Samuel 30:7 ). When David ascended the throne of Judah, Abiathar was appointed high priest ( 1 Chronicles 15:11 ;  1 Kings 2:26 ) and the "king's companion" ( 1 Chronicles 27:34 ). Meanwhile Zadok, of the house of Eleazar, had been made high priest. These appointments continued in force till the end of David's reign ( 1 Kings 4:4 ). Abiathar was deposed (the sole historical instance of the deposition of a high priest) and banished to his home at Anathoth by Solomon, because he took part in the attempt to raise Adonijah to the throne. The priesthood thus passed from the house of Ithamar ( 1 Samuel 2:30-36 ;  1 Kings 1:19 ;  1 Kings 2:26 1 Kings 2:27 ). Zadok now became sole high priest. In  Mark 2:26 , reference is made to an occurrence in "the days of Abiathar the high priest." But from  1 Samuel 22 , we learn explicitly that this event took place when Ahimelech, the father of Abiathar, was high priest. The apparent discrepancy is satisfactorily explained by interpreting the words in Mark as referring to the life-time of Abiathar, and not to the term of his holding the office of high priest. It is not implied in Mark that he was actual high priest at the time referred to. Others, however, think that the loaves belonged to Abiathar, who was at that time ( Leviticus 24:9 ) a priest, and that he either himself gave them to David, or persuaded his father to give them.  </p>
Abib	<p>an ear of corn, the month of newly-ripened grain ( Exodus 13:4 ;  23:15 ); the first of the Jewish ecclesiastical year, and the seventh of the civil year. It began about the time of the vernal equinox, on 21st March. It was called Nisan, after the Captivity ( Nehemiah 2:1 ). On the fifteenth day of the month, harvest was begun by gathering a sheaf of barley, which was offered unto the Lord on the sixteenth ( Leviticus 23:4-11 ).  </p>
Abida	<p>or Abi'dah, father of knowledge; knowing, one of the five sons of Midian, who was the son of Abraham by Keturah ( 1 Chronicles 1:33 ), and apparently the chief of an Arab tribe.  </p>
Abidan	<p>father of judgment; judge, head of the tribe of Benjamin at the Exodus ( Numbers 1:11 ;  2:22 ).  </p>
Abieezer	<p>father of help; i.e., "helpful." </p><li> The second of the three sons of Hammoleketh, the sister of Gilead. He was the grandson of Manasseh ( 1 Chronicles 7:18 ). From his family Gideon sprang ( Joshua 17:2 ; Compare  Judges 6:34 ;  8:2 ). He was also called Jeezer ( Numbers 26:30 ).  </li><li> One of David's thirty warriors ( 2 Samuel 23:27 ; Compare  1 Chronicles 27:12 ).  </li><li> The prince of the tribe of Dan at the Exodus ( Numbers 1:12 ).   </li>
Abiel	<p>father (i.e., "possessor") of God = "pious." </p><li> The son of Zeror and father of Ner, who was the grandfather of Saul ( 1 Samuel 14:51 ;  1 Chronicles 8:33 ;  9:39 ). In  1 Samuel 9:1 , he is called the "father," probably meaning the grandfather, of Kish. </li><li> An Arbathite, one of David's warriors ( 1 Chronicles 11:32 ); called also Abi-albon ( 2 Samuel 23:31 ).   </li>
Abiezrite	<p>father of help, a descendant of Abiezer ( Judges 6:11 Judges 6:24 ;  8:32 ).  </p>
Abigail	<p>father (i.e., "leader") of the dance, or "of joy." </p><li> The sister of David, and wife of Jether an Ishmaelite ( 1 Chronicles 2:16 1 Chronicles 2:17 ). She was the mother of Amasa ( 2 Samuel 17:25 ).  </li><li> The wife of the churlish Nabal, who dwelt in the district of Carmel ( 1 Samuel 25:3 ). She showed great prudence and delicate management at a critical period of her husband's life. She was "a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance." After Nabal's death she became the wife of David ( 1 Samuel 25:14-42 ), and was his companion in all his future fortunes ( 1 Samuel 27:3 ;  30:5 ;  2 Sam  2:2 ). By her David had a son called Chileab ( 2 Samuel 3:3 ), elsewhere called Daniel ( 1 Chronicles 3:1 ).   </li>
Abihail	<p>father of might. </p><li> Numbers 3:35 . </li><li> 1 Chronicles 2:29 . </li><li> 1 Chronicles 5:14 .  </li><li> The second wife of King Rehoboam ( 2 Chronicles 11:18 ), a descendant of Eliab, David's eldest brother.  </li><li> The father of Esther and uncle of Mordecai ( Esther 2:15 ).   </li>
Abihu	<p>father of Him; i.e., "worshipper of God", the second of the sons of Aaron ( Exodus 6:23 ;  Numbers 3:2 ;  26:60 ;  1 Chronicles 6:3 ). Along with his three brothers he was consecrated to the priest's office ( Exodus 28:1 ). With his father and elder brother he accompanied the seventy elders part of the way up the mount with Moses ( Exodus 24:1 Exodus 24:9 ). On one occasion he and Nadab his brother offered incense in their censers filled with "strange" (i.e., common) fire, i.e., not with fire taken from the great brazen altar ( Leviticus 6:9 , etc.), and for this offence they were struck dead, and were taken out and buried without the camp ( Leviticus 10:1-11 ; Compare  Numbers 3:4 ;  26:61 ;  1 Chronicles 24:2 ). It is probable that when they committed this offence they were intoxicated, for immediately after is given the law prohibiting the use of wine or strong drink to the priests.  </p>
Abihud	<p>father (i.e., "possessor") of renown. </p><li> One of the sons of Bela, the son of Benjamin ( 1 Chronicles 8:3 ); called also Ahihud (ver. 7).  </li><li> A descendant of Zerubbabel and father of Eliakim ( Matthew 1:13 , "Abiud"); called also Juda ( Luke 3:26 ), and Obadiah ( 1 Chronicles 3:21 ).   </li>
Abijah	<p>father (i.e., "possessor or worshipper") of Jehovah. </p><li> 1 Chronicles 7:8 . </li><li> 1 Chronicles 2:24 .  </li><li> The second son of Samuel ( 1 Samuel 8:2 ;  1 Chronicles 6:28 ). His conduct, along with that of his brother, as a judge in Beer-sheba, to which office his father had appointed him, led to popular discontent, and ultimately provoked the people to demand a royal form of government.  </li><li> A descendant of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, a chief of one of the twenty-four orders into which the priesthood was divided by David ( 1 Chronicles 24:10 ). The order of Abijah was one of those which did not return from the Captivity ( Ezra 2:36-39 ;  Nehemiah 7:39-42 ;  12:1 ).  </li><li> The son of Rehoboam, whom he succeeded on the throne of Judah ( 1 Chronicles 3:10 ). He is also called Abijam ( 1 Kings 14:31 ;  15:1-8 ). He began his three years' reign ( 2 Chronicles 12:16 ;  2 Chronicles 13:1 2 Chronicles 13:2 ) with a strenuous but unsuccessful effort to bring back the ten tribes to their allegiance. His address to "Jeroboam and all Israel," before encountering them in battle, is worthy of being specially noticed ( 2 Chronicles 13:5-12 ). It was a very bloody battle, no fewer than 500,000 of the army of Israel having perished on the field. He is described as having walked "in all the sins of his father" ( 1 Kings 15:3 ;  2 Chr  11:20-22 ). It is said in  1 Kings 15:2  that "his mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom;" but in  2 Chronicles 13:2  we read, "his mother's name was Michaiah, the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah." The explanation is that Maachah is just a variation of the name Michaiah, and that Abishalom is probably the same as Absalom, the son of David. It is probable that "Uriel of Gibeah" married Tamar, the daughter of Absalom ( 2 Samuel 14:27 ), and by her had Maachah. The word "daughter" in  1 Kings 15:2  will thus, as it frequently elsewhere does, mean grand-daughter.  </li><li> A son of Jeroboam, the first king of Israel. On account of his severe illness when a youth, his father sent his wife to consult the prophet Ahijah regarding his recovery. The prophet, though blind with old age, knew the wife of Jeroboam as soon as she approached, and under a divine impulse he announced to her that inasmuch as in Abijah alone of all the house of Jeroboam there was found "some good thing toward the Lord," he only would come to his grave in peace. As his mother crossed the threshold of the door on her return, the youth died, and "all Israel mourned for him" ( 1 Kings 14:1-18 ).  </li><li> The daughter of Zechariah ( 2 Chronicles 29:1 ; Compare  Isaiah 8:2 ), and afterwards the wife of Ahaz. She is also called Abi ( 2 Kings 18:2 ).  </li><li> One of the sons of Becher, the son of Benjamin ( 1 Chronicles 7:8 ). "Abiah," A.V.   </li>
Abijam	<p>father of the sea; i.e., "seaman" the name always used in Kings of the king of Judah, the son of Rehoboam, elsewhere called Abijah ( 1 Kings 15:1 1 Kings 15:7 1 Kings 15:8 ). (See ABIJAH,5.)  </p>
Abilene	<p>a plain, a district lying on the east slope of the Anti-Lebanon range; so called from its chief town, Abila ( Luke 3:1 ), which stood in the Suk Wady Barada, between Heliopolis (Baalbec) and Damascus, 38 miles from the former and 18 from the latter. Lysanias was governor or tetrarch of this province.  </p>
Abimael	<p>father of Mael, one of the sons or descendants of Joktan, in Northern Arabia ( Genesis 10:28 ;  1 Chronicles 1:22 ).  </p>
Abimelech	<p>my father a king, or father of a king, a common name of the Philistine kings, as "Pharaoh" was of the Egyptian kings. </p><li> The Philistine king of Gerar in the time of Abraham ( Genesis 20:1-18 ). By an interposition of Providence, Sarah was delivered from his harem, and was restored to her husband Abraham. As a mark of respect he gave to Abraham valuable gifts, and offered him a settlement in any part of his country; while at the same time he delicately and yet severely rebuked him for having practised a deception upon him in pretending that Sarah was only his sister. Among the gifts presented by the king were a thousand pieces of silver as a "covering of the eyes" for Sarah; i.e., either as an atoning gift and a testimony of her innocence in the sight of all, or rather for the purpose of procuring a veil for Sarah to conceal her beauty, and thus as a reproof to her for not having worn a veil which, as a married woman, she ought to have done. A few years after this Abimelech visited Abraham, who had removed southward beyond his territory, and there entered into a league of peace and friendship with him. This league was the first of which we have any record. It was confirmed by a mutual oath at Beer-sheba ( Genesis 21:22-34 ).  </li><li> A king of Gerar in the time of Isaac, probably the son of the preceeding ( Genesis 26:1-22 ). Isaac sought refuge in his territory during a famine, and there he acted a part with reference to his wife Rebekah similar to that of his father Abraham with reference to Sarah. Abimelech rebuked him for the deception, which he accidentally discovered. Isaac settled for a while here, and prospered. Abimelech desired him, however, to leave his territory, which Isaac did. Abimelech afterwards visited him when he was encamped at Beer-sheba, and expressed a desire to renew the covenant which had been entered into between their fathers ( Genesis 26:26-31 ).  </li><li> A son of Gideon ( Judges 9:1 ), who was proclaimed king after the death of his father ( Judges 8:33-9:6). ). One of his first acts was to murder his brothers, seventy in number, "on one stone," at Ophrah. Only one named Jotham escaped. He was an unprincipled, ambitious ruler, often engaged in war with his own subjects. When engaged in reducing the town of Thebez, which had revolted, he was struck mortally on his head by a mill-stone, thrown by the hand of a woman from the wall above. Perceiving that the wound was mortal, he desired his armour-bearer to thrust him through with his sword, that it might not be said he had perished by the hand of a woman ( Judges 9:50-57 ).  </li><li> The son of Abiathar, and high priest in the time of David ( 1 Chronicles 18:16 ). In the parallel passage,  2 Samuel 8:17 , we have the name Ahimelech, and Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech. This most authorities consider the more correct reading. </li><li> Achish, king of Gath, in the title of  Psalms 34 . (Compare  1 Samuel 21:10-15 .)   </li>
Abinadab	<p>father of nobleness; i.e., "noble." </p><li> A Levite of Kirjath-jearim, in whose house the ark of the covenant was deposited after having been brought back from the land of the Philistines ( 1 Samuel 7:1 ). It remained there twenty years, till it was at length removed by David ( 1 Samuel 7:1 1 Samuel 7:2 ;  1 Chronicles 13:7 ).  </li><li> The second of the eight sons of Jesse ( 1 Samuel 16:8 ). He was with Saul in the campaign against the Philistines in which Goliath was slain ( 1 Samuel 17:13 ).  </li><li> One of Saul's sons, who peristed with his father in the battle of Gilboa ( 1 Samuel 31:2 ;  1 Chronicles 10:2 ).  </li><li> One of Solomon's officers, who "provided victuals for the king and his household." He presided, for this purpose, over the district of Dor ( 1 Kings 4:11 ).   </li>
Abinoam	<p>father of kindness, the father of Barak ( Judges 4:6 ;  5:1 ).  </p>
Abiram	<p>father of height; i.e., "proud." </p><li> One of the sons of Eliab, who joined Korah in the conspiracy against Moses and Aaron. He and all the conspirators, with their families and possessions (except the children of Korah), were swallowed up by an earthquake ( Numbers 16:1-27 ;  26:9 ;  Psalms 106:17 ).  </li><li> The eldest son of Hiel the Bethelite, who perished prematurely in consequence of his father's undertaking to rebuild Jericho ( 1 Kings 16:34 ), according to the words of ( Joshua 6:26 ). (See JERICHO)   </li>
Abishag	<p>father of (i.e., "given to") error, a young woman of Shunem, distinguished for her beauty. She was chosen to minister to David in his old age. She became his wife ( 1 Kings 1:3 1 Kings 1:4 1 Kings 1:15 ). After David's death Adonijah persuaded Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, to entreat the king to permit him to marry Abishag. Solomon suspected in this request an aspiration to the throne, and therefore caused him to be put to death ( 1 Kings 2:17-25 ).  </p>
Abishai	<p>father of (i.e., "desirous of") a gift, the eldest son of Zeruiah, David's sister. He was the brother of Joab and Asahel ( 2 Samuel 2:18 ;  1 Chronicles 2:16 ). Abishai was the only one who accompanied David when he went to the camp of Saul and took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster ( 1 Samuel 26:5-12 ). He had the command of one of the three divisions of David's army at the battle with Absalom ( 2 Samuel 18:2 2 Samuel 18:5 2 Samuel 18:12 ). He slew the Philistine giant Ishbi-benob, who threatened David's life ( 2 Samuel 21:15-17 ). He was the chief of the second rank of the three "mighties" ( 2 Samuel 23:18 2 Samuel 23:19 ;  1 Chronicles 11:20 1 Chronicles 11:21 ); and on one occasion withstood 300 men, and slew them with his own spear ( 2 Samuel 23:18 ). Abishai is the name of the Semitic chief who offers gifts to the lord of Beni-Hassan. See illustration facing page 10.  </p>
Abishua	<p>father of welfare; i.e., "fortunate." </p><li> The grandson of Benjamin ( 1 Chronicles 8:4 ).  </li><li> The son of Phinehas the high priest ( 1 Chronicles 6:4 1 Chronicles 6:5 1 Chronicles 6:50 ;  Ezra 7:5 ).   </li>
Abishur	<p>father of the wall; i.e., "mason", one of the two sons of Shammai of the tribe of Judah ( 1 Chronicles 2:28 1 Chronicles 2:29 ).  </p>
Abital	<p>father of dew; i.e., "fresh", David's fifth wife ( 2 Samuel 3:4 ).  </p>
Abitub	<p>father of goodness, a Benjamite ( 1 Chronicles 8:11 ).  </p>
Abjects	<p>( Psalms 35:15 ), the translation of a Hebrew word meaning smiters; probably, in allusion to the tongue, slanderers. (Compare  Jeremiah 18:18 .)  </p>
Ablution	<p>or washing, was practised, </p><li> When a person was initiated into a higher state: e.g., when Aaron and his sons were set apart to the priest's office, they were washed with water previous to their investiture with the priestly robes ( Leviticus 8:6 ).  </li><li> Before the priests approached the altar of God, they were required, on pain of death, to wash their hands and their feet to cleanse them from the soil of common life ( Exodus 30:17-21 ). To this practice the Psalmist alludes,  Psalms 26:6 .  </li><li> There were washings prescribed for the purpose of cleansing from positive defilement contracted by particular acts. Of such washings eleven different species are prescribed in the Levitical law ( <span class="badLink">Leviticus 1215</span> -15).  </li><li> A fourth class of ablutions is mentioned, by which a person purified or absolved himself from the guilt of some particular act. For example, the elders of the nearest village where some murder was committed were required, when the murderer was unknown, to wash their hands over the expiatory heifer which was beheaded, and in doing so to say, "Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it" ( Deuteronomy 21:1-9 ). So also Pilate declared himself innocent of the blood of Jesus by washing his hands ( Matthew 27:24 ). This act of Pilate may not, however, have been borrowed from the custom of the Jews. The same practice was common among the Greeks and Romans.  <p> The Pharisees carried the practice of ablution to great excess, thereby claiming extraordinary purity ( Matthew 23:25 ). ( Mark 7:1-5 ) refers to the ceremonial ablutions. The Pharisees washed their hands "oft," more correctly, "with the fist" (RSV, "diligently"), or as an old father, Theophylact, explains it, "up to the elbow." (Compare also  Mark 7:4 ;  Leviticus 6:28 ;  11: :  <span class="badLink">3236</span> -36;  15:22 ) (See WASHING)  </p> </li>
Abner	<p>father of light; i.e., "enlightening", the son of Ner and uncle of Saul. He was commander-in-chief of Saul's army ( 1 Samuel 14:50 ;  17:55 ;  20:25 ). He first introduced David to the court of Saul after the victory over Goliath ( 1 Samuel 17:57 ). After the death of Saul, David was made king over Judah, and reigned in Hebron. Among the other tribes there was a feeling of hostility to Judah; and Abner, at the head of Ephraim, fostered this hostility in the interest of the house of Saul, whose son Ish-bosheth he caused to be proclaimed king ( 2 Samuel 2:8 ). A state of war existed between these two kings. A battle fatal to Abner, who was the leader of Ish-boseth's army, was fought with David's army under Joab at Gibeon ( 2 Samuel 2:12 ). Abner, escaping from the field, was overtaken by Asahel, who was "light of foot as a wild roe," the brother of Joab and Abishai, whom he thrust through with a back stroke of his spear ( 2 Samuel 2: :  <span class="badLink">1832</span> -32).  </p><p> Being rebuked by Ish-bosheth for the impropriety of taking to wife Rizpah, who had been a concubine of King Saul, he found an excuse for going over to the side of David, whom he now professed to regard as anointed by the Lord to reign over all Israel. David received him favourably, and promised that he would have command of the armies. At this time Joab was absent from Hebron, but on his return he found what had happened. Abner had just left the city; but Joab by a stratagem recalled him, and meeting him at the gate of the city on his return, thrust him through with his sword ( 2 Samuel 3:27 2 Samuel 3:31-39 ;  4:12 . Compare  1 Kings 2:5 1 Kings 2:32 ). David lamented in pathetic words the death of Abner, "Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?" ( 2 Samuel 3:33-38 .)  </p>
Abomination	<p>This word is used, </p><li> To express the idea that the Egyptians considered themselves as defiled when they ate with strangers ( Genesis 43:32 ). The Jews subsequently followed the same practice, holding it unlawful to eat or drink with foreigners ( John 18:28 ;  Acts 10:28 ;  11:3 ).  </li><li> Every shepherd was "an abomination" unto the Egyptians ( Genesis 46:34 ). This aversion to shepherds, such as the Hebrews, arose probably from the fact that Lower and Middle Egypt had formerly been held in oppressive subjection by a tribe of nomad shepherds (the Hyksos), who had only recently been expelled, and partly also perhaps from this other fact that the Egyptians detested the lawless habits of these wandering shepherds.  </li><li> Pharaoh was so moved by the fourth plague, that while he refused the demand of Moses, he offered a compromise, granting to the Israelites permission to hold their festival and offer their sacrifices in Egypt. This permission could not be accepted, because Moses said they would have to sacrifice "the abomination of the Egyptians" ( Exodus 8:26 ); i.e., the cow or ox, which all the Egyptians held as sacred, and which they regarded it as sacrilegious to kill.  </li><li> ( Daniel 11:31 ), in that section of his prophecies which is generally interpreted as referring to the fearful calamities that were to fall on the Jews in the time of Antiochus Epiphanes, says, "And they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate." Antiochus Epiphanes caused an altar to be erected on the altar of burnt-offering, on which sacrifices were offered to Jupiter Olympus. (Compare 1Macc  <span class="badLink">1:57</span> ). This was the abomination of the desolation of Jerusalem. The same language is employed in  Daniel 9:27  (Compare  Matthew 24:15 ), where the reference is probably to the image-crowned standards which the Romans set up at the east gate of the temple (A.D. 70), and to which they paid idolatrous honours. "Almost the entire religion of the Roman camp consisted in worshipping the ensign, swearing by the ensign, and in preferring the ensign before all other gods." These ensigns were an "abomination" to the Jews, the "abomination of desolation."  <p> This word is also used symbolically of sin in general ( Isaiah 66:3 ); an idol ( 44:19 ); the ceremonies of the apostate Church of Rome ( Revelation 17:4 ); a detestable act ( Ezekiel 22:11 ).  </p> </li>
Abraham	<p>father of a multitude, son of Terah, named ( Genesis 11:27 ) before his older brothers Nahor and Haran, because he was the heir of the promises. Till the age of seventy, Abram sojourned among his kindred in his native country of Chaldea. He then, with his father and his family and household, quitted the city of Ur, in which he had hitherto dwelt, and went some 300 miles north to Haran, where he abode fifteen years. The cause of his migration was a call from God ( Acts 7:2-4 ). There is no mention of this first call in the Old Testament; it is implied, however, in  Genesis 12 . While they tarried at Haran, Terah died at the age of 205 years. Abram now received a second and more definite call, accompanied by a promise from God ( Genesis 12:1 Genesis 12:2 ); whereupon he took his departure, taking his nephew Lot with him, "not knowing whither he went" ( Hebrews 11:8 ). He trusted implicitly to the guidance of Him who had called him.  </p><p> Abram now, with a large household of probably a thousand souls, entered on a migratory life, and dwelt in tents. Passing along the valley of the Jabbok, in the land of Canaan, he formed his first encampment at Sichem ( Genesis 12:6 ), in the vale or oak-grove of Moreh, between Ebal on the north and Gerizim on the south. Here he received the great promise, "I will make of thee a great nation," etc. ( Genesis 12:2 Genesis 12:3 Genesis 12:7 ). This promise comprehended not only temporal but also spiritual blessings. It implied that he was the chosen ancestor of the great Deliverer whose coming had been long ago predicted ( Genesis 3:15 ). Soon after this, for some reason not mentioned, he removed his tent to the mountain district between Bethel, then called Luz, and Ai, towns about two miles apart, where he built an altar to "Jehovah." He again moved into the southern tract of Palestine, called by the Hebrews the Negeb; and was at length, on account of a famine, compelled to go down into Egypt. This took place in the time of the Hyksos, a Semitic race which now held the Egyptians in bondage. Here occurred that case of deception on the part of Abram which exposed him to the rebuke of Pharaoh ( Genesis 12:18 ). Sarai was restored to him; and Pharaoh loaded him with presents, recommending him to withdraw from the country. He returned to Canaan richer than when he left it, "in cattle, in silver, and in gold" ( Genesis 12:8 ;  13:2 . Compare  Psalms 105:13 Psalms 105:14 ). The whole party then moved northward, and returned to their previous station near Bethel. Here disputes arose between Lot's shepherds and those of Abram about water and pasturage. Abram generously gave Lot his choice of the pasture-ground. (Compare  1 Corinthians 6:7 .) He chose the well-watered plain in which Sodom was situated, and removed thither; and thus the uncle and nephew were separated. Immediately after this Abram was cheered by a repetition of the promises already made to him, and then removed to the plain or "oak-grove" of Mamre, which is in Hebron. He finally settled here, pitching his tent under a famous oak or terebinth tree, called "the oak of Mamre" ( Genesis 13:18 ). This was his third resting-place in the land.  </p><p> Some fourteen years before this, while Abram was still in Chaldea, Palestine had been invaded by Chedorlaomer, King of Elam, who brought under tribute to him the five cities in the plain to which Lot had removed. This tribute was felt by the inhabitants of these cities to be a heavy burden, and after twelve years they revolted. This brought upon them the vengeance of Chedorlaomer, who had in league with him four other kings. He ravaged the whole country, plundering the towns, and carrying the inhabitants away as slaves. Among those thus treated was Lot. Hearing of the disaster that had fallen on his nephew, Abram immediately gathered from his own household a band of 318 armed men, and being joined by the Amoritish chiefs Mamre, Aner, and Eshcol, he pursued after Chedorlaomer, and overtook him near the springs of the Jordan. They attacked and routed his army, and pursued it over the range of Anti-Libanus as far as to Hobah, near Damascus, and then returned, bringing back all the spoils that had been carried away. Returning by way of Salem, i.e., Jerusalem, the king of that place, Melchizedek, came forth to meet them with refreshments. To him Abram presented a tenth of the spoils, in recognition of his character as a priest of the most high God ( Genesis 14:18-20 ).  </p><p> In a recently-discovered tablet, dated in the reign of the grandfather of Amraphel ( Genesis 14:1 ), one of the witnesses is called "the Amorite, the son of Abiramu," or Abram.  </p><p> Having returned to his home at Mamre, the promises already made to him by God were repeated and enlarged ( Genesis 13:14 ). "The word of the Lord" (an expression occurring here for the first time) "came to him" ( 15:1 ). He now understood better the future that lay before the nation that was to spring from him. Sarai, now seventy-five years old, in her impatience, persuaded Abram to take Hagar, her Egyptian maid, as a concubine, intending that whatever child might be born should be reckoned as her own. Ishmael was accordingly thus brought up, and was regarded as the heir of these promises ( Genesis 16 ). When Ishmael was thirteen years old, God again revealed yet more explicitly and fully his gracious purpose; and in token of the sure fulfilment of that purpose the patriarch's name was now changed from Abram to Abraham ( Genesis 17:4 Genesis 17:5 ), and the rite of circumcision was instituted as a sign of the covenant. It was then announced that the heir to these covenant promises would be the son of Sarai, though she was now ninety years old; and it was directed that his name should be Isaac. At the same time, in commemoration of the promises, Sarai's name was changed to Sarah. On that memorable day of God's thus revealing his design, Abraham and his son Ishmael and all the males of his house were circumcised ( Genesis 17 ). Three months after this, as Abraham sat in his tent door, he saw three men approaching. They accepted his proffered hospitality, and, seated under an oak-tree, partook of the fare which Abraham and Sarah provided. One of the three visitants was none other than the Lord, and the other two were angels in the guise of men. The Lord renewed on this occasion his promise of a son by Sarah, who was rebuked for her unbelief. Abraham accompanied the three as they proceeded on their journey. The two angels went on toward Sodom; while the Lord tarried behind and talked with Abraham, making known to him the destruction that was about to fall on that guilty city. The patriarch interceded earnestly in behalf of the doomed city. But as not even ten righteous persons were found in it, for whose sake the city would have been spared, the threatened destruction fell upon it; and early next morning Abraham saw the smoke of the fire that consumed it as the "smoke of a furnace" ( Genesis 19:1-28 ).  </p><p> After fifteen years' residence at Mamre, Abraham moved southward, and pitched his tent among the Philistines, near to Gerar. Here occurred that sad instance of prevarication on his part in his relation to Abimelech the King ( Genesis 20 ). (See ABIMELECH) Soon after this event, the patriarch left the vicinity of Gerar, and moved down the fertile valley about 25 miles to Beer-sheba. It was probably here that Isaac was born, Abraham being now an hundred years old. A feeling of jealousy now arose between Sarah and Hagar, whose son, Ishmael, was no longer to be regarded as Abraham's heir. Sarah insisted that both Hagar and her son should be sent away. This was done, although it was a hard trial to Abraham ( Genesis 21:12 ). (See HAGAR;  ISHMAEL.) </p><p> At this point there is a blank in the patriarch's history of perhaps twenty-five years. These years of peace and happiness were spent at Beer-sheba. The next time we see him his faith is put to a severe test by the command that suddenly came to him to go and offer up Isaac, the heir of all the promises, as a sacrifice on one of the mountains of Moriah. His faith stood the test ( Hebrews 11:17-19 ). He proceeded in a spirit of unhesitating obedience to carry out the command; and when about to slay his son, whom he had laid on the altar, his uplifted hand was arrested by the angel of Jehovah, and a ram, which was entangled in a thicket near at hand, was seized and offered in his stead. From this circumstance that place was called Jehovah-jireh, i.e., "The Lord will provide." The promises made to Abraham were again confirmed (and this was the last recorded word of God to the patriarch); and he descended the mount with his son, and returned to his home at Beer-sheba ( Genesis 22:19 ), where he resided for some years, and then moved northward to Hebron.  </p><p> Some years after this Sarah died at Hebron, being 127 years old. Abraham acquired now the needful possession of a burying-place, the cave of Machpelah, by purchase from the owner of it, Ephron the Hittite ( Genesis 23 ); and there he buried Sarah. His next care was to provide a wife for Isaac, and for this purpose he sent his steward, Eliezer, to Haran (or Charran,  Acts 7:2 ), where his brother Nahor and his family resided ( Genesis 11:31 ). The result was that Rebekah, the daughter of Nahor's son Bethuel, became the wife of Isaac ( Genesis 24 ). Abraham then himself took to wife Keturah, who became the mother of six sons, whose descendants were afterwards known as the "children of the east" ( Judges 6:3 ), and later as "Saracens." At length all his wanderings came to an end. At the age of 175 years, 100 years after he had first entered the land of Canaan, he died, and was buried in the old family burying-place at Machpelah ( Genesis 25:7-10 ).  </p><p> The history of Abraham made a wide and deep impression on the ancient world, and references to it are interwoven in the religious traditions of almost all Eastern nations. He is called "the friend of God" ( James 2:23 ), "faithful Abraham" ( Galatians 3:9 ), "the father of us all" ( Romans 4:16 ).  </p>
Abrahams bosom	<p>( Luke 16:22 Luke 16:23 ) refers to the custom of reclining on couches at table, which was prevalent among the Jews, an arrangement which brought the head of one person almost into the bosom of the one who sat or reclined above him. To "be in Abraham's bosom" thus meant to enjoy happiness and rest ( Matthew 8:11 ;  Luke 16:23 ) at the banquet in Paradise. (See BANQUET; MEALS.)  </p>
Abram	<p>exalted father. (see ABRAHAM.) </p>
Abronah	<p>RSV, one of Israel's halting-places in the desert (Num.33:34,35), just before Ezion-gaber. In A.V., "Ebronah."  </p>
Absalom	<p>father of peace; i.e., "peaceful" David's son by Maacah ( 2 Samuel 3:3 ; Compare  1 Kings 1:6 ). He was noted for his personal beauty and for the extra-ordinary profusion of the hair of his head ( 2 Samuel 14:25 2 Samuel 14:26 ). The first public act of his life was the blood-revenge he executed against Amnon, David's eldest son, who had basely wronged Absalom's sister Tamar. This revenge was executed at the time of the festivities connected with a great sheep-shearing at Baal-hazor. David's other sons fled from the place in horror, and brought the tidings of the death of Amnon to Jerusalem. Alarmed for the consequences of the act, Absalom fled to his grandfather at Geshur, and there abode for three years ( 2 Samuel 3:3 ;  13:23-38 ).  </p><p> David mourned his absent son, now branded with the guilt of fratricide. As the result of a stratagem carried out by a woman of Tekoah, Joab received David's sanction to invite Absalom back to Jerusalem. He returned accordingly, but two years elapsed before his father admitted him into his presence ( 2 Samuel 14:28 ). Absalom was now probably the oldest surviving son of David, and as he was of royal descent by his mother as well as by his father, he began to aspire to the throne. His pretensions were favoured by the people. By many arts he gained their affection; and after his return from Geshur ( 2 Samuel 15:7 ; marg., RSV) he went up to Hebron, the old capital of Judah, along with a great body of the people, and there proclaimed himself king. The revolt was so successful that David found it necessary to quit Jerusalem and flee to Mahanaim, beyond Jordan; where upon Absalom returned to Jerusalem and took possession of the throne without opposition. Ahithophel, who had been David's chief counsellor, deserted him and joined Absalom, whose chief counsellor he now became. Hushai also joined Absalom, but only for the purpose of trying to counteract the counsels of Ahithophel, and so to advantage David's cause. He was so far successful that by his advice, which was preferred to that of Ahithophel, Absalom delayed to march an army against his father, who thus gained time to prepare for the defence.  </p><p> Absalom at length marched out against his father, whose army, under the command of Joab, he encountered on the borders of the forest of Ephraim. Twenty thousand of Absalom's army were slain in that fatal battle, and the rest fled. Absalom fled on a swift mule; but his long flowing hair, or more probably his head, was caught in the bough of an oak, and there he was left suspended till Joab came up and pierced him through with three darts. His body was then taken down and cast into a pit dug in the forest, and a heap of stones was raised over his grave. When the tidings of the result of that battle were brought to David, as he sat impatiently at the gate of Mahanaim, and he was told that Absalom had been slain, he gave way to the bitter lamentation: "O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!" ( 2 Samuel 18:33 . Compare  Exodus 32:32 ;  Romans 9:3 ).  </p><p> Absalom's three sons ( 2 Samuel 14:27 ; comp  18:18 ) had all died before him, so that he left only a daughter, Tamar, who became the grandmother of Abijah.  </p>
Acacia	<p>(Heb. shittim)  Exodus 25:5 , RSV probably the Acacia seyal (the gum-arabic tree); called the "shittah" tree ( Isaiah 41:19 ). Its wood is called shittim wood ( Exodus 26:15 Exodus 26:26 ;  Exodus 25:10 Exodus 25:13 Exodus 25:23 Exodus 25:28 , etc.). This species (A. seyal) is like the hawthorn, a gnarled and thorny tree. It yields the gum-arabic of commerce. It is found in abundance in the Sinaitic peninsula.  </p>
Accad	<p>the high land or mountains, a city in the land of Shinar. It has been identified with the mounds of Akker Kuf, some 50 miles to the north of Babylon; but this is doubtful. It was one of the cities of Nimrod's kingdom ( Genesis 10:10 ). It stood close to the Euphrates, opposite Sippara. (See SEPHARVAIM)  </p><p> It is also the name of the country of which this city was the capital, namely, northern or upper Babylonia. The Accadians who came from the "mountains of the east," where the ark rested, attained to a high degree of civilization. In the Babylonian inscriptions they are called "the black heads" and "the black faces," in contrast to "the white race" of Semitic descent. They invented the form of writing in pictorial hieroglyphics, and also the cuneiform system, in which they wrote many books partly on papyrus and partly on clay. The Semitic Babylonians ("the white race"), or, as some scholars think, first the Cushites, and afterwards, as a second immigration, the Semites, invaded and conquered this country; and then the Accadian language ceased to be a spoken language, although for the sake of its literary treasures it continued to be studied by the educated classes of Babylonia. A large portion of the Ninevite tablets brought to light by Oriental research consists of interlinear or parallel translations from Accadian into Assyrian; and thus that long-forgotten language has been recovered by scholars. It belongs to the class of languages called agglutinative, common to the Tauranian race; i.e., it consists of words "glued together," without declension of conjugation. These tablets in a remarkable manner illustrate ancient history. Among other notable records, they contain an account of the Creation which closely resembles that given in the book of Genesis, of the Sabbath as a day of rest, and of the Deluge and its cause. (See BABYLON; CHALDEA .) </p>
Accho	<p>sultry or sandy, a town and harbour of Phoenicia, in the tribe of Asher, but never acquired by them ( Judges 1:31 ). It was known to the ancient Greeks and Romans by the name of Ptolemais, from Ptolemy the king of Egypt, who rebuilt it about B.C. 100. Here Paul landed on his last journey to Jerusalem ( Acts 21:7 ). During the crusades of the Middle Ages it was called Acra; and subsequently, on account of its being occupied by the Knights Hospitallers of Jerusalem, it was called St. Jean d'Acre, or simply Acre.  </p>
Accuser	<p>Satan is styled the "accuser of the brethren" ( Revelation 12:10 . Compare  Job 1:6 ;  Zechariah 3:1 ), as seeking to uphold his influence among men by bringing false charges against Christians, with the view of weakening their influence and injuring the cause with which they are identified. He was regarded by the Jews as the accuser of men before God, laying to their charge the violations of the law of which they were guilty, and demanding their punishment. The same Greek word, rendered "accuser," is found in  John 8:10  (but omitted in the Revised Version);  Acts 23:30 Acts 23:35 ;  24:8 ;  Acts 25:16 Acts 25:18 , in all of which places it is used of one who brings a charge against another.  </p>
Aceldama	<p>the name which the Jews gave in their proper tongue, i.e., in Aramaic, to the field which was purchased with the money which had been given to the betrayer of our Lord. The word means "field of blood." It was previously called "the potter's field" ( Matthew 27:7 Matthew 27:8 ;  Acts 1:19 ), and was appropriated as the burial-place for strangers. It lies on a narrow level terrace on the south face of the valley of Hinnom. Its modern name is Hak ed-damm.  </p>
Achaia	<p>the name originally of a narrow strip of territory in Greece, on the north-west of the Peloponnesus. Subsequently it was applied by the Romans to the whole Peloponnesus, now called the Morea, and the south of Greece. It was then one of the two provinces (Macedonia being the other) into which they divided the country when it fell under their dominion. It is in this latter enlarged meaning that the name is always used in the New Testament ( Acts 18:12 Acts 18:27 ;  19:21 ;  Romans 15: :  26 ;  16:5 , etc.). It was at the time when Luke wrote the Acts of the Apostles under the proconsular form of government; hence the appropriate title given to Gallio as the "deputy," i.e., proconsul, of Achaia ( Acts 18:12 ).  </p>
Achaichus	<p>( 1 Corinthians 16:17 ), one of the members of the church of Corinth who, with Fortunatus and Stephanas, visited Paul while he was at Ephesus, for the purpose of consulting him on the affairs of the church. These three probably were the bearers of the letter from Corinth to the apostle to which he alludes in  1 Corinthians 7:1 .  </p>
Achan	<p>called also Achar, i.e., one who troubles ( 1 Chronicles 2:7 ), in commemoration of his crime, which brought upon him an awful destruction ( Joshua 7:1 ). On the occasion of the fall of Jericho, he seized, contrary to the divine command, an ingot of gold, a quantity of silver, and a costly Babylonish garment, which he hid in his tent. Joshua was convinced that the defeat which the Israelites afterwards sustained before Ai was a proof of the divine displeasure on account of some crime, and he at once adopted means by the use of the lot for discovering the criminal. It was then found that Achan was guilty, and he was stoned to death in the valley of Achor. He and all that belonged to him were then consumed by fire, and a heap of stones was raised over the ashes.  </p>
Achbor	<p>gnawing = mouse. </p><li> An Edomitish king ( Genesis 36:38 ;  1 Chronicles 1:49 ).  </li><li> One of Josiah's officers sent to the prophetess Huldah to inquire regarding the newly-discovered book of the law ( 2 Kings 22:12 2 Kings 22:14 ). He is also called Abdon ( 2 Chronicles 34:20 ).   </li>
Achish	<p>angry, perhaps only a general title of royalty applicable to the Philistine kings. </p><li> The king with whom David sought refuge when he fled from Saul ( 1 Samuel 21:10-15 ). He is called Abimelech in the superscription of  Psalms 34 . It was probably this same king to whom David a second time repaired at the head of a band of 600 warriors, and who assigned him Ziklag, whence he carried on war against the surrounding tribes ( 1 Samuel 27:5-12 ). Achish had great confidence in the valour and fidelity of David ( 1 Samuel 28:1 1 Samuel 28:2 ), but at the instigation of his courtiers did not permit him to go up to battle along with the Philistine hosts ( 1 Samuel 29:2-11 ). David remained with Achish a year and four months. </li><li> Another king of Gath, probably grandson of the foregoing, to whom the two servants of Shimei fled. This led Shimei to go to Gath in pursuit of them, and the consequence was that Solomon put him to death ( 1 Kings 2:39-46 ).   </li>
Achmetha	<p>( Ezra 6:2 ), called Ecbatana by classical writers, the capital of northern Media. Here was the palace which was the residence of the old Median monarchs, and of Cyrus and Cambyses. In the time of Ezra, the Persian kings resided usually at Susa of Babylon. But Cyrus held his court at Achmetha; and Ezra, writing a century after, correctly mentions the place where the decree of Cyrus was found.  </p>
Achor	<p>trouble, a valley near Jericho, so called in consequence of the trouble which the sin of Achan caused Israel ( Joshua 7:24 Joshua 7:26 ). The expression "valley of Achor" probably became proverbial for that which caused trouble, and when Isaiah ( Isaiah 65:10 ) refers to it he uses it in this sense: "The valley of Achor, a place for herds to lie down in;" i.e., that which had been a source of calamity would become a source of blessing. Hosea also ( Hosea 2:15 ) uses the expression in the same sense: "The valley of Achor for a door of hope;" i.e., trouble would be turned into joy, despair into hope. This valley has been identified with the Wady Kelt.  </p>
Achsah	<p>anklet, Caleb's only daughter ( 1 Chronicles 2:49 ). She was offered in marriage to the man who would lead an attack on the city of Debir, or Kirjath-sepher. This was done by Othniel (q.v.), who accordingly obtained her as his wife ( Joshua 15:16-19 ; Judg.  1:9-15 ).  </p>
Achshaph	<p>fascination, a royal city of the Canaanites, in the north of Palestine ( Joshua 11:1 ;  12:20 ;  19:25 ). It was in the eastern boundary of the tribe of Asher, and is identified with the modern ruined village of Kesaf or Yasif, N.E. of Accho.  </p>
Achzib	<p>falsehood. </p><li> A town in the Shephelah, or plain country of Judah ( Joshua 15:44 ); probably the same as Chezib of  Genesis 38:5  = Ain Kezbeh.  </li><li> A Phoenician city (the Gr. Ecdippa), always retained in their possession though assigned to the tribe of Asher ( Joshua 19:29 ;  Judges 1:31 ). It is identified with the modern es-Zib, on the Mediterranean, about 8 miles north of Accho.   </li>
Acre	<p>is the translation of a word (tse'med), which properly means a yoke, and denotes a space of ground that may be ploughed by a yoke of oxen in a day. It is about an acre of our measure ( Isaiah 5:10 ;  1 Samuel 14:14 ).  </p>
Acts of the Apostles	<p>the title now given to the fifth and last of the historical books of the New Testament. The author styles it a "treatise" ( 1:1 ). It was early called "The Acts," "The Gospel of the Holy Ghost," and "The Gospel of the Resurrection." It contains properly no account of any of the apostles except Peter and Paul. John is noticed only three times; and all that is recorded of James, the son of Zebedee, is his execution by Herod. It is properly therefore not the history of the "Acts of the Apostles," a title which was given to the book at a later date, but of "Acts of Apostles," or more correctly, of "Some Acts of Certain Apostles."  </p><p> As regards its authorship, it was certainly the work of Luke, the "beloved physician" (Compare  Luke 1:1-4 ;  Acts 1:1 ). This is the uniform tradition of antiquity, although the writer nowhere makes mention of himself by name. The style and idiom of the Gospel of Luke and of the Acts, and the usage of words and phrases common to both, strengthen this opinion. The writer first appears in the narrative in  16:11 , and then disappears till Paul's return to Philippi two years afterwards, when he and Paul left that place together ( 20:6 ), and the two seem henceforth to have been constant companions to the end. He was certainly with Paul at Rome (28;  Colossians 4:14 ). Thus he wrote a great portion of that history from personal observation. For what lay beyond his own experience he had the instruction of Paul. If, as is very probable, 2Tim. was written during Paul's second imprisonment at Rome, Luke was with him then as his faithful companion to the last ( 2 Timothy 4:11 ). Of his subsequent history we have no certain information.  </p><p> The design of Luke's Gospel was to give an exhibition of the character and work of Christ as seen in his history till he was taken up from his disciples into heaven; and of the Acts, as its sequel, to give an illustration of the power and working of the gospel when preached among all nations, "beginning at Jerusalem." The opening sentences of the Acts are just an expansion and an explanation of the closing words of the Gospel. In this book we have just a continuation of the history of the church after Christ's ascension. Luke here carries on the history in the same spirit in which he had commenced it. It is only a book of beginnings, a history of the founding of churches, the initial steps in the formation of the Christian society in the different places visited by the apostles. It records a cycle of "representative events." </p><p> All through the narrative we see the ever-present, all-controlling power of the ever-living Saviour. He worketh all and in all in spreading abroad his truth among men by his Spirit and through the instrumentality of his apostles. </p><p> The time of the writing of this history may be gathered from the fact that the narrative extends down to the close of the second year of Paul's first imprisonment at Rome. It could not therefore have been written earlier than A.D. 61 or 62, nor later than about the end of A.D. 63. Paul was probably put to death during his second imprisonment, about A.D. 64, or, as some think, 66.  </p><p> The place where the book was written was probably Rome, to which Luke accompanied Paul. </p><p> The key to the contents of the book is in  1:8 , "Ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth." After referring to what had been recorded in a "former treatise" of the sayings and doings of Jesus Christ before his ascension, the author proceeds to give an account of the circumstances connected with that event, and then records the leading facts with reference to the spread and triumphs of Christianity over the world during a period of about thirty years. The record begins with Pentecost (A.D. 33) and ends with Paul's first imprisonment (A.D. 63 or 64). The whole contents of the book may be divided into these three parts:  </p><li> Chaps. 1-12, describing the first twelve years of the Christian church. This section has been entitled "From Jerusalem to Antioch." It contains the history of the planting and extension of the church among the Jews by the ministry of Peter.  </li><li> Chaps. 13-21, Paul's missionary journeys, giving the history of the extension and planting of the church among the Gentiles.  </li><li> Chaps. 21-28, Paul at Rome, and the events which led to this. Chaps. 13-28 have been entitled "From Antioch to Rome."  <p> In this book it is worthy of note that no mention is made of the writing by Paul of any of his epistles. This may be accounted for by the fact that the writer confined himself to a history of the planting of the church, and not to that of its training or edification. The relation, however, between this history and the epistles of Paul is of such a kind, i.e., brings to light so many undesigned coincidences, as to prove the genuineness and authenticity of both, as is so ably shown by Paley in his <i>Horae Paulinae</i>. "No ancient work affords so many tests of veracity; for no other has such numerous points of contact in all directions with contemporary history, politics, and topography, whether Jewish, or Greek, or Roman." Lightfoot. (See PAUL.) </p> </li>
Adah	<p>ornament. </p><li> The first of Lamech's two wives, and the mother of Jabal and Jubal ( Genesis 4:19 Genesis 4:20 Genesis 4:23 ).  </li><li> The first of Esau's three wives, the daughter of Elon the Hittite ( Genesis 36:2 Genesis 36:4 ), called also Bashemath ( 26:34 ).   </li>
Adam	<p>red, a Babylonian word, the generic name for man, having the same meaning in the Hebrew and the Assyrian languages. It was the name given to the first man, whose creation, fall, and subsequent history and that of his descendants are detailed in the first book of Moses (Gen ( Genesis 5 ). "God created man [Heb., Adam] in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."  </p><p> Adam was absolutely the first man whom God created. He was formed out of the dust of the earth (and hence his name), and God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and gave him dominion over all the lower creatures ( Genesis 1:26 ;  2:7 ). He was placed after his creation in the Garden of Eden, to cultivate it, and to enjoy its fruits under this one prohibition: "Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."  </p><p> The first recorded act of Adam was his giving names to the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, which God brought to him for this end. Thereafter the Lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon him, and while in an unconscious state took one of his ribs, and closed up his flesh again; and of this rib he made a woman, whom he presented to him when he awoke. Adam received her as his wife, and said, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man." He called her Eve, because she was the mother of all living. </p><p> Being induced by the tempter in the form of a serpent to eat the forbidden fruit, Eve persuaded Adam, and he also did eat. Thus man fell, and brought upon himself and his posterity all the sad consequences of his transgression. The narrative of the Fall comprehends in it the great promise of a Deliverer ( Genesis 3:15 ), the "first gospel" message to man. They were expelled from Eden, and at the east of the garden God placed a flame, which turned every way, to prevent access to the tree of life ( Genesis 3 ). How long they were in Paradise is matter of mere conjecture.  </p><p> Shortly after their expulsion Eve brought forth her first-born, and called him Cain. Although we have the names of only three of Adam's sons, viz., Cain, Abel, and Seth, yet it is obvious that he had several sons and daughters ( Genesis 5:4 ). He died aged 930 years.  </p><p> Adam and Eve were the progenitors of the whole human race. Evidences of varied kinds are abundant in proving the unity of the human race. The investigations of science, altogether independent of historical evidence, lead to the conclusion that God "hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth" ( Acts 17:26 . Compare  Romans 5:12-12 ;  1 Corinthians 15:22-49 ).  </p>
Adam, a type	<p>The apostle Paul speaks of Adam as "the figure of him who was to come." On this account our Lord is sometimes called the second Adam. This typical relation is described in  Romans 5:14-19 .  </p>
Adam, the city of	<p>is referred to in  Joshua 3:16 . It stood "beside Zarethan," on the west bank of Jordan ( 1 Kings 4:12 ). At this city the flow of the water was arrested and rose up "upon an heap" at the time of the Israelites' passing over ( Joshua 3:16 ).  </p>
Adamah	<p>red earth, a fortified city of Naphtali, probably the modern Damieh, on the west side of the sea of Tiberias ( Joshua 19:33 Joshua 19:36 ).  </p>
Adamant	<p>(Heb. shamir),  Ezekiel 3:9 . The Greek word adamas means diamond. This stone is not referred to, but corundum or some kind of hard steel. It is an emblem of firmness in resisting adversaries of the truth ( Zechariah 7:12 ), and of hard-heartedness against the truth ( Jeremiah 17:1 ).  </p>
Adar	<p>large, the sixth month of the civil and the twelfth of the ecclesiastical year of the Jews ( Esther 3:7 Esther 3:13 ;  8:12 ;  Esther 9:1 Esther 9:15 Esther 9:17 Esther 9:19 Esther 9:21 ). It included the days extending from the new moon of our March to the new moon of April. The name was first used after the Captivity. When the season was backward, and the lambs not yet of a paschal size, or the barley not forward enough for abib, then a month called Veadar, i.e., a second Adar, was intercalated.  </p>
Adbeel	<p>miracle of God, the third of the twelve sons of Ishmael, and head of an Arabian tribe ( Genesis 25:13 ;  1 Chronicles 1:29 ).  </p>
Addar	<p>ample, splendid, son of Bela ( 1 Chronicles 8:3 ); called also "Ard" ( Genesis 46:21 )  </p>
Adder	<p>( Psalms 140:3 ;  Romans 3:13 , "asp") is the rendering of, </p><li> Akshub ("coiling" or "lying in wait"), properly an asp or viper, found only in this passage. </li><li> Pethen ("twisting"), a viper or venomous serpent identified with the cobra (Naja haje) ( Psalms 58:4 ;  91:13 ); elsewhere "asp." </li><li> Tziphoni ("hissing") ( Proverbs 23:32 ); elsewhere rendered "cockatrice,"  Isaiah 11:8 ;  14:29 ;  59:5 ;  Jeremiah 8:17 , as it is here in the margin of the Authorized Version. The Revised Version has "basilisk." This may have been the yellow viper, the Daboia xanthina, the largest and most dangerous of the vipers of Palestine. </li><li> Shephiphon ("creeping"), occurring only in  Genesis 49:17 , the small speckled venomous snake, the "horned snake," or cerastes. Dan is compared to this serpent, which springs from its hiding-place on the passer-by.   </li>
Addi	<p>ornament, ( Luke 3:28 ), the son of Cosam, and father of Melchi, one of the progenitors of Christ.  </p>
Addon	<p>low, one of the persons named in  Nehemiah 7:61  who could not "shew their father's house" on the return from captivity. This, with similar instances (ver. 63), indicates the importance the Jews attached to their genealogies.  </p>
Adiel	<p>ornament of God. </p><li> The father of Azmaveth, who was treasurer under David and Solomon ( 1 Chronicles 27:25 ). </li><li> A family head of the tribe of Simeon ( 1 Chronicles 4:36 ). </li><li> A priest ( 1 Chronicles 9:12 ).   </li>
Adin	<p>effeminate. </p><li> Ezra 8:6 . </li><li> Nehemiah 10:16 .   </li>
Adina	<p>slender, one of David's warriors ( 1 Chronicles 11:42 ), a Reubenite.  </p>
Adino	<p>the Eznite, one of David's mighty men ( 2 Samuel 23:8 ). (See JASHOBEAM)  </p>
Adjuration	<p>a solemn appeal whereby one person imposes on another the obligation of speaking or acting as if under an oath ( 1 Samuel 14:24 ;  Joshua 6:26 ;  1 Kings 22:16 ).  </p><p> We have in the New Testament a striking example of this ( Matthew 26:63 ;  Mark 5:7 ), where the high priest calls upon Christ to avow his true character. It would seem that in such a case the person so adjured could not refuse to give an answer.  </p><p> The word "adjure", i.e., cause to swear is used with reference to the casting out of demons ( Acts 19:13 ).  </p>
Admah	<p>earth, one of the five cities of the vale of Siddim ( Genesis 10:19 ). It was destroyed along with Sodom and Gomorrah ( 19:24 ;  Deuteronomy 29:23 ). It is supposed by some to be the same as the Adam of  Joshua 3:16 , the name of which still lingers in Damieh, the ford of Jordan. (See ZEBOIM)  </p>
Adnah	<p>delight. </p><li> A chief of the tribe of Manasseh who joined David at Ziklag ( 1 Chronicles 12:20 ). </li><li> A general under Jehoshaphat, chief over 300,000 men ( 2 Chronicles 17:14 ).   </li>
Adonibezek	<p>lord of Bezek, a Canaanitish king who, having subdued seventy of the chiefs that were around him, made an attack against the armies of Judah and Simeon, but was defeated and brought as a captive to Jerusalem, where his thumbs and great toes were cut off. He confessed that God had requited him for his like cruelty to the seventy kings whom he had subdued ( Judges 1:4-7 ; Compare  1 Samuel 15:33 ).  </p>
Adonijah	<p>my Lord is Jehovah. </p><li> The fourth son of David ( 2 Samuel 3:4 ). After the death of his elder brothers, Amnon and Absalom, he became heir-apparent to the throne. But Solomon, a younger brother, was preferred to him. Adonijah, however, when his father was dying, caused himself to be proclaimed king. But Nathan and Bathsheba induced David to give orders that Solomon should at once be proclaimed and admitted to the throne. Adonijah fled and took refuge at the altar, and received pardon for his conduct from Solomon on the condition that he showed himself "a worthy man" ( 1 Kings 1:5-53 ). He afterwards made a second attempt to gain the throne, but was seized and put to death ( 1 Kings 2:13-25 ).  </li><li> A Levite sent with the princes to teach the book of the law to the inhabitants of Judah ( 2 Chronicles 17:8 ).  </li><li> One of the "chiefs of the people" after the Captivity ( Nehemiah 10:16 ).   </li>
Adonikam	<p>whom the Lord sets up, one of those "which came with Zerubbabel" ( Ezra 2:13 ). His "children," or retainers, to the number of 666, came up to Jerusalem ( 8:13 ).  </p>
Adoniram	<p>(Adoram,  1 Kings 12:18 ), the son of Abda, was "over the tribute," i.e., the levy or forced labour. He was stoned to death by the people of Israel ( 1 Kings 4:6 ;  5:14 )  </p>
Adoni-zedec	<p>lord of justice or righteousness, was king in Jerusalem at the time when the Israelites invaded Palestine ( Joshua 10:1 Joshua 10:3 ). He formed a confederacy with the other Canaanitish kings against the Israelites, but was utterly routed by Joshua when he was engaged in besieging the Gibeonites. The history of this victory and of the treatment of the five confederated kings is recorded in  Joshua 10:1-27 . (Compare  Deuteronomy 21:23 ). Among the Tell Amarna tablets (see EGYPT) are some very interesting letters from Adoni-zedec to the King of Egypt. These illustrate in a very remarkable manner the history recorded in  Joshua 10 , and indeed throw light on the wars of conquest generally, so that they may be read as a kind of commentary on the book of Joshua. Here the conquering career of the Abiri (i.e., Hebrews) is graphically described: "Behold, I say that the land of the king my lord is ruined", "The wars are mighty against me", "The Hebrew chiefs plunder all the king's lands", "Behold, I the chief of the Amorites am breaking to pieces." Then he implores the king of Egypt to send soldiers to help him, directing that the army should come by sea to Ascalon or Gaza, and thence march to Wru-sa-lim (Jerusalem) by the valley of Elah.  </p>
Adoption	<p>the giving to any one the name and place and privileges of a son who is not a son by birth. </p><li> Natural. Thus Pharaoh's daughter adopted Moses ( Exodus 2:10 ), and Mordecai Esther ( Esther 2:7 ).  </li><li> National. God adopted Israel ( Exodus 4:22 ;  Deuteronomy 7:6 ;  Hosea 11:1 ;  Romans 9:4 ).  </li><li> Spiritual. An act of God's grace by which he brings men into the number of his redeemed family, and makes them partakers of all the blessings he has provided for them. Adoption represents the new relations into which the believer is introduced by justification, and the privileges connected therewith, viz., an interest in God's peculiar love ( John 17:23 ;  Romans 5:5-8 ), a spiritual nature ( 2 Peter 1:4 ;  John 1:13 ), the possession of a spirit becoming children of God ( 1 Peter 1:14 ;  2 John  4 ;  Romans 8:15-21 ;  Galatians 5:1 ;  Hebrews 2:15 ), present protection, consolation, supplies ( Luke 12:27-32 ;  John 14:18 ;  1 Corinthians 3:21-23 ;  2 co  1:4 ), fatherly chastisements ( Hebrews 12:5-11 ), and a future glorious inheritance ( Romans 8:17 Romans 8:23 ;  James 2:5 ;  Philippians 3:21 ).   </li>
Adoram	<p>See ADONIRAM . </p>
Adore	<p>to worship; to express reverence and homage. The forms of adoration among the Jews were putting off the shoes ( Exodus 3:5 ;  Joshua 5:15 ), and prostration ( Genesis 17:3 ;  Psalms 95:6 ;  Isaiah 44:15 Isaiah 44:17 Isaiah 44:19 ;  46:6 ). To "kiss the Son" in  Psalms 2:12  is to adore and worship him. (See   Daniel 3:5 Daniel 3:6 .) The word itself does not occur in Scripture.  </p>
Adrammelech	<p>Adar the king. </p><li> An idol; a form of the sun-god worshipped by the inhabitants of Sepharvaim ( 2 Kings 17:31 ), and brought by the Sepharvite colonists into Samaria. </li><li> A son of Sennacherib, king of Assyria ( 2 Kings 19:37 ;  Isaiah 37:38 ).   </li>
Adramyttium	<p>a city of Asia Minor on the coast of Mysia, which in early times was called AEolis. The ship in which Paul embarked at Caesarea belonged to this city ( Acts 27:2 ). He was conveyed in it only to Myra, in Lycia, whence he sailed in an Alexandrian ship to Italy. It was a rare thing for a ship to sail from any port of Palestine direct for Italy. It still bears the name Adramyti, and is a place of some traffic.  </p>
Adria	<p>( Acts 27:27 ; RSV, "the sea of Adria"), the Adriatic Sea, including in Paul's time the whole of the Mediterranean lying between Crete and Sicily. It is the modern Gulf of Venice, the <i> Mare Superum_ of the Romans, as distinguished from the </i> Mare Inferum_ or Tyrrhenian Sea. </p>
Adriel	<p>flock of God, the son of Barzillai, the Meholathite, to whom Saul gave in marriage his daughter Merab ( 1 Samuel 18:19 ). The five sons that sprang from this union were put to death by the Gibeonites ( 2 Samuel 21:8 2 Samuel 21:9 . Here it is said that Michal "brought up" [RSV, "bare"] these five sons, either that she treated them as if she had been their own mother, or that for "Michal" we should read "Merab," as in  1 Samuel 18:19 ).  </p>
Adullam	<p>one of the royal cities of the Canaanites, now 'Aid-el-ma ( Joshua 12:15 ;  15:35 ). It stood on the old Roman road in the valley of Elah (q.v.), which was the scene of David's memorable victory over Goliath ( 1 Samuel 17:2 ), and not far from Gath. It was one of the towns which Rehoboam fortified against Egypt ( 2 Chronicles 11:7 ). It was called "the glory of Israel" ( Micah 1:15 ).  </p><p> The Cave of Adullam has been discovered about 2 miles south of the scene of David's triumph, and about 13 miles west from Bethlehem. At this place is a hill some 500 feet high pierced with numerous caverns, in one of which David gathered together "every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented" ( 1 Samuel 22:2 ). Some of these caverns are large enough to hold 200 or 300 men. According to tradition this cave was at Wady Khureitun, between Bethlehem and the Dead Sea, but this view cannot be well maintained.  </p>
Adullamite	<p>an inhabitant of the city of Adullam ( Genesis 38:1 Genesis 38:12 Genesis 38:20 ).  </p>
Adultery	<p>conjugal infidelity. An adulterer was a man who had illicit intercourse with a married or a betrothed woman, and such a woman was an adulteress. Intercourse between a married man and an unmarried woman was fornication. Adultery was regarded as a great social wrong, as well as a great sin. </p><p> The Mosaic law ( Numbers 5:11-31 ) prescribed that the suspected wife should be tried by the ordeal of the "water of jealousy." There is, however, no recorded instance of the application of this law. In subsequent times the Rabbis made various regulations with the view of discovering the guilty party, and of bringing about a divorce. It has been inferred from  John 8:1-11  that this sin became very common during the age preceding the destruction of Jerusalem.  </p><p> Idolatry, covetousness, and apostasy are spoken of as adultery spiritually ( Jeremiah 3:6 Jeremiah 3:8 Jeremiah 3:9 ;  Ezekiel 16:32 ;  Hosea 1:2:3; ;  Revelation 2:22 ). An apostate church is an adulteress ( Isaiah 1:21 ; Ezek.  Isaiah 23:4 Isaiah 23:7  Isaiah 23:37 ), and the Jews are styled "an adulterous generation" ( Matthew 12:39 ). (Compare  Revelation 12 .)  </p>
Adummim	<p>the red ones, a place apparently on the road between Jericho and Jerusalem, "on the south side of the torrent" Wady Kelt, looking toward Gilgal, mentioned  Joshua 15:7 ;  18:17 . It was nearly half-way between Jerusalem and Jericho, and now bears the name of Tal-at-ed-Dumm. It is supposed to have been the place referred to in the parable of the Good Samaritan ( Luke 10:30-37 ). Recently a new carriage-road has been completed, and carriages for the first time have come along this road from Jerusalem.  </p>
Adversary	<p>(Heb. satan), an opponent or foe ( 1 Kings 5:4 ;  1 Kings 11:14 1 Kings 11:23 1 Kings 11:25 ;  Luke 13:17 ); one that speaks against another, a complainant ( Matthew 5:25 ;  Luke 12:58 ); an enemy ( Luke 18:3 ), and specially the devil ( 1 Peter 5:8 ).  </p>
Advocate	<p>(Gr. parakletos), one who pleads another's cause, who helps another by defending or comforting him. It is a name given by Christ three times to the Holy Ghost ( John 14:16 ;  15:26 ;  16:7 , where the Greek word is rendered "Comforter," q.v.). It is applied to Christ in  1 John 2:1 , where the same Greek word is rendered "Advocate," the rendering which it should have in all the places where it occurs. Tertullus "the orator" ( Acts 24:1 ) was a Roman advocate whom the Jews employed to accuse Paul before Felix.  </p>
AEnon	<p>springs, a place near Salim where John baptized ( John 3:23 ). It was probably near the upper source of the Wady Far'ah, an open valley extending from Mount Ebal to the Jordan. It is full of springs. A place has been found called 'Ainun, four miles north of the springs.  </p>
Affection	<p>feeling or emotion. Mention is made of "vile affections" ( Romans 1:26 ) and "inordinate affection" ( Colossians 3:5 ). Christians are exhorted to set their affections on things above ( Colossians 3:2 ). There is a distinction between natural and spiritual or gracious affections ( Ezekiel 33:32 ).  </p>
Affinity	<p>relationship by alliance ( 2 Chronicles 18:1 ) or by marriage ( 1 Kings 3:1 ). Marriages are prohibited within certain degrees of affinity, enumerated  Leviticus 18:6-17 . Consanguinity is relationship by blood.  </p>
Afflictions	<p>common to all ( Job 5:7 ;  14:1 ;  Psalms 34:19 ); are for the good of men ( James 1:2 James 1:3 James 1:12 ;  2 co  12:7 ) and the glory of God ( 2 Corinthians 12:7-10 ;  1 Peter 4:14 ), and are to be borne with patience by the Lord's people ( Psalms 94:12 ;  Proverbs 3:12 ). They are all directed by God ( Lamentations 3:33 ), and will result in the everlasting good of his people ( 2 Corinthians 4:16-18 ) in Christ Jesus ( Romans 8:35-39 ).  </p>
Agabus	<p>a "prophet," probably one of the seventy disciples of Christ. He prophesied at Antioch of an approaching famine ( Acts 11:27 Acts 11:28 ). Many years afterwards he met Paul at Caesarea, and warned him of the bonds and affliction that awaited him at Jerusalem should he persist in going thither ( Acts 21:10-12 ).  </p>
Agag	<p>flame, the usual title of the Amalekite kings, as "Pharaoh" was of the Egyptian. </p><li> A king of the Amalekites referred to by Balaam ( Numbers 24:7 ). He lived at the time of the Exodus.  </li><li> Another king of the Amalekites whom Saul spared unlawfully, but whom Samuel on his arrival in the camp of Saul ordered, in retributive justice (Judg. 1), to be brought out and cut in pieces ( 1 Samuel 15:8-33 . Compare  Exodus 17:11 ;  Numbers 14:45 ).   </li>
Agagite	<p>a name applied to Haman and also to his father ( Esther 3:1 Esther 3:10 ;  Esther 8:3 Esther 8:5 ). Probably it was equivalent to Amalekite.  </p>
Agate	<p>(Heb. shebo), a precious stone in the breast-plate of the high priest ( Exodus 28:19 ;  39:12 ), the second in the third row. This may be the agate properly so called, a semi-transparent crystallized quartz, probably brought from Sheba, whence its name. In  Isaiah 54:12  and  Ezekiel 27:16 , this word is the rendering of the Hebrew cadcod, which means "ruddy," and denotes a variety of minutely crystalline silica more or less in bands of different tints.  </p><p> This word is from the Greek name of a stone found in the river Achates in Sicily. </p>
Age	<p>used to denote the period of a man's life ( Genesis 47:28 ), the maturity of life ( John 9:21 ), the latter end of life ( Job 11:17 ), a generation of the human race ( Job 8:8 ), and an indefinite period ( Ephesians 2:7 ;  Ephesians 3:5 Ephesians 3:21 ;  Colossians 1:26 ). Respect to be shown to the aged ( Leviticus 19:32 ). It is a blessing to communities when they have old men among them ( Isaiah 65:20 ;  Zechariah 8:4 ). The aged supposed to excel in understanding ( Job 12:20 ;  15:10 ;  Job 32:4 Job 32:9 ;  1 Kings 12:6 1 Kings 12:8 ). A full age the reward of piety ( Job 5:26 ;  Genesis 15:15 ).  </p>[J] indicates this entry was also found in Jack Van Impe's Prophecy Dictionary<br/>
Agee	<p>fugitive, the father of Shammah, who was one of David's mighty men ( 2 Samuel 23:11 )  </p>
Agony	<p>contest; wrestling; severe struggling with pain and suffering. Anguish is the reflection on evil that is already past, while agony is a struggle with evil at the time present. It is only used in the New Testament by ( Luke 22:44 ) to describe our Lord's fearful struggle in Gethsemane.  </p><p> The verb from which the noun "agony" is derived is used to denote an earnest endeavour or striving, as "Strive [agonize] to enter" ( Luke 13:24 ); "Then would my servants fight" [agonize] ( John 18:36 ). Compare  1 Corinthians 9:25 ;  Colossians 1:29 ;  4:12 ;  1 Timothy 6:12 ;  2 Tim  4:7 , where the words "striveth," "labour," "conflict," "fight," are the renderings of the same Greek verb.  </p>
Agriculture	<p>Tilling the ground ( Genesis 2:15 ;  Genesis 4:2 Genesis 4:3 Genesis 4:12 ) and rearing cattle were the chief employments in ancient times. The Egyptians excelled in agriculture. And after the Israelites entered into the possession of the Promised Land, their circumstances favoured in the highest degree a remarkable development of this art. Agriculture became indeed the basis of the Mosaic commonwealth.  </p><p> The year in Palestine was divided into six agricultural periods:- </p><p> I. SOWING TIME.  Tisri, latter half  (beginning about the autumnal equinox.)  Marchesvan.  Kisleu, former half.  Early rain due = first showers of autumn. </p><p> II. UNRIPE TIME.  Kisleu, latter half.  Tebet.  Sebat, former half. </p><p> III. COLD SEASON.  Sebat, latter half.  Adar.  [Veadar.]  Nisan, former half.  Latter rain due ( Deuteronomy 11:14 ;  Jeremiah 5:24 ;  Hosea 6:3 ;  Zechariah 10:1 ;   James 5:7 ;  Job 29:23 ).  </p><p> IV. HARVEST TIME.  Nisan, latter half.  (Beginning about vernal equinox. Barley green. Passover.)  Ijar.  Sivan, former half., Wheat ripe. Pentecost. </p><p> V. SUMMER (total absence of rain)  Sivan, latter half.  Tammuz.  Ab, former half. </p><p> VI. SULTRY SEASON  Ab, latter half.  Elul.  Tisri, former half., Ingathering of fruits. </p><p> The six months from the middle of Tisri to the middle of Nisan were occupied with the work of cultivation, and the rest of the year mainly with the gathering in of the fruits. The extensive and easily-arranged system of irrigation from the rills and streams from the mountains made the soil in every part of Palestine richly productive ( Psalms 1:3 ;  65:10 ;  Proverbs 21:1 ;  Isaiah 30:25 ;  Isaiah 32:2 Isaiah 32:20 ;  Hosea 12:11 ), and the appliances of careful cultivation and of manure increased its fertility to such an extent that in the days of Solomon, when there was an abundant population, "20,000 measures of wheat year by year" were sent to Hiram in exchange for timber ( 1 Kings 5:11 ), and in large quantities also wheat was sent to the Tyrians for the merchandise in which they traded ( Ezekiel 27:17 ). The wheat sometimes produced an hundredfold ( Genesis 26:12 ;  Matthew 13:23 ). Figs and pomegranates were very plentiful ( Numbers 13:23 ), and the vine and the olive grew luxuriantly and produced abundant fruit ( Deuteronomy 33:24 ).  </p><p> Lest the productiveness of the soil should be exhausted, it was enjoined that the whole land should rest every seventh year, when all agricultural labour would entirely cease ( Leviticus 25:1-7 ;  Deuteronomy 15:1-10 ).  </p><p> It was forbidden to sow a field with divers seeds ( Deuteronomy 22:9 ). A passer-by was at liberty to eat any quantity of corn or grapes, but he was not permitted to carry away any ( Deuteronomy 23:24 Deuteronomy 23:25 ;  Matthew 12:1 ). The poor were permitted to claim the corners of the fields and the gleanings. A forgotten sheaf in the field was to be left also for the poor. (See   Leviticus 19:9 Leviticus 19:10 ;  Deuteronomy 24:19 .)  </p><p> Agricultural implements and operations. </p><p> The sculptured monuments and painted tombs of Egypt and Assyria throw much light on this subject, and on the general operations of agriculture. Ploughs of a simple construction were known in the time of Moses ( Deuteronomy 22:10 ; Compare  Job 1:14 ). They were very light, and required great attention to keep them in the ground ( Luke 9:62 ). They were drawn by oxen ( Job 1:14 ), cows ( 1 Samuel 6:7 ), and asses ( Isaiah 30:24 ); but an ox and an ass must not be yoked together in the same plough ( Deuteronomy 22:10 ). Men sometimes followed the plough with a hoe to break the clods ( Isaiah 28:24 ). The oxen were urged on by a "goad," or long staff pointed at the end, so that if occasion arose it could be used as a spear also ( Judges 3:31 ;  1 Samuel 13:21 ).  </p><p> When the soil was prepared, the seed was sown broadcast over the field ( Matthew 13:3-8 ). The "harrow" mentioned in  Job 39:10  was not used to cover the seeds, but to break the clods, being little more than a thick block of wood. In highly irrigated spots the seed was trampled in by cattle ( Isaiah 32:20 ); but doubtless there was some kind of harrow also for covering in the seed scattered in the furrows of the field.  </p><p> The reaping of the corn was performed either by pulling it up by the roots, or cutting it with a species of sickle, according to circumstances. The corn when cut was generally put up in sheaves ( Genesis 37:7 ;  Leviticus 23:10-15 ;  Ruth 2:7 Ruth 2:15 ;  Job 24:10 ;  Jeremiah 9:22 ;  Micah 4:12 ), which were afterwards gathered to the threshing-floor or stored in barns ( Matthew 6:26 ).  </p><p> The process of threshing was performed generally by spreading the sheaves on the threshing-floor and causing oxen and cattle to tread repeatedly over them ( Deuteronomy 25:4 ;  Isaiah 28:28 ). On occasions flails or sticks were used for this purpose ( Ruth 2:17 ;  Isaiah 28:27 ). There was also a "threshing instrument" ( Isaiah 41:15 ;  Amos 1:3 ) which was drawn over the corn. It was called by the Hebrews a moreg, a threshing roller or sledge ( 2 Samuel 24:22 ;  1 Chronicles 21:23 ;  Isaiah 3:15 ). It was somewhat like the Roman tribulum, or threshing instrument.  </p><p> When the grain was threshed, it was winnowed by being thrown up against the wind ( Jeremiah 4:11 ), and afterwards tossed with wooden scoops ( Isaiah 30:24 ). The shovel and the fan for winnowing are mentioned in  Psalms 35:5 ,  Job 21:18 ,  Isaiah 17:13 . The refuse of straw and chaff was burned ( Isaiah 5:24 ). Freed from impurities, the grain was then laid up in granaries till used ( Deuteronomy 28:8 ;  Proverbs 3:10 ;  Matthew 6:26 ;  13:30 ;  Luke 12:18 ).  </p>
Agrippa I.	<p>the grandson of Herod the Great, and son of Aristobulus and Bernice. The Roman emperor Caligula made him governor first of the territories of Philip, then of the tetrarchy of Lysanias, with the title of king ("king Herod"), and finally of that of Antipas, who was banished, and of Samaria and Judea. Thus he became ruler over the whole of Palestine. He was a persecutor of the early Christians. He slew James, and imprisoned Peter ( Acts 12:1-4 ). He died at Caesarea, being "eaten of worms" ( Acts 12:23 ), A.D. 44. (Compare Josephus, Ant. xix. 8.)  </p>
Agrippa II.	<p>son of the foregoing, was born at Rome, A.D. 27. He was the brother of Bernice and Drusilla. The Emperor Claudius (A.D. 48) invested him with the office of superintendent of the Temple of Jerusalem, and made him governor (A.D. 50) of Chalcis. He was afterwards raised to the rank of king, and made governor over the tetrarchy of Philip and Lysanias ( Acts 25:13 ;  Acts 26:2 Acts 26:7 ). It was before him that Paul delivered (A.D. 59) his speech recorded in  Acts 26 . His private life was very profligate. He died (the last of his race) at Rome, at the age of about seventy years, A.D. 100.  </p>
Ague	<p>the translation in  Leviticus 26:16  (RSV, "fever") of the Hebrew word kaddah'ath, meaning "kindling", i.e., an inflammatory or burning fever. In  Deuteronomy 28:22  the word is rendered "fever."  </p>
Agur	<p>gatherer; the collector, mentioned as author of the sayings in  Proverbs 30 . Nothing is known of him beyond what is there recorded.  </p>
Ah!	<p>an exclamation of sorrow or regret ( Psalms 35:25 ;  Isaiah 1:4 Isaiah 1:24 ;  Jeremiah 1:6 ;  22:18 ;  Mark 15:29 ).  </p>
Aha!	<p>an exclamation of ridicule ( Psalms 35:21 ;  40:15 ;  70:3 ). In  Isaiah 44:16  it signifies joyful surprise, as also in  Job 39:25 , RSV  </p>
Ahab	<p>father's brother. </p><li> The son of Omri, whom he succeeded as the seventh king of Israel. His history is recorded in  1 Kings 1622 -22. His wife was Jezebel (q.v.), who exercised a very evil influence over him. To the calf-worship introduced by Jeroboam he added the worship of Baal. He was severely admonished by Elijah (q.v.) for his wickedness. His anger was on this account kindled against the prophet, and he sought to kill him. He undertook three campaigns against Ben-hadad II., king of Damascus. In the first two, which were defensive, he gained a complete victory over Ben-hadad, who fell into his hands, and was afterwards released on the condition of his restoring all the cities of Israel he then held, and granting certain other concessions to Ahab. After three years of peace, for some cause Ahab renewed war ( 1 Kings 22:3 ) with Ben-hadad by assaulting the city of Ramoth-gilead, although the prophet Micaiah warned him that he would not succeed, and that the 400 false prophets who encouraged him were only leading him to his ruin. Micaiah was imprisoned for thus venturing to dissuade Ahab from his purpose. Ahab went into the battle disguised, that he might if possible escape the notice of his enemies; but an arrow from a bow "drawn at a venture" pierced him, and though stayed up in his chariot for a time he died towards evening, and Elijah's prophecy ( 1 Kings 21:19 ) was fulfilled. He reigned twenty-three years. Because of his idolatry, lust, and covetousness, Ahab is referred to as pre-eminently the type of a wicked king ( 2 Kings 8:18 ;  2 Chr  22:3 ;  Micah 6:16 ).  </li><li> A false prophet referred to by Jeremiah ( Jeremiah 29:21 ), of whom nothing further is known.   </li>
Ahasuerus	<p>There are three kings designated by this name in Scripture. </p><li> The father of Darius the Mede, mentioned in  Daniel 9:1 . This was probably the Cyaxares I. known by this name in profane history, the king of Media and the conqueror of Nineveh.  </li><li> The king mentioned in  Ezra 4:6 , probably the Cambyses of profane history, the son and successor of Cyrus (B.C. 529).  </li><li> The son of Darius Hystaspes, the king named in the Book of Esther. He ruled over the kingdoms of Persia, Media, and Babylonia, "from India to Ethiopia." This was in all probability the Xerxes of profane history, who succeeded his father Darius (B.C. 485). In the LXX. version of the Book of Esther the name Artaxerxes occurs for Ahasuerus. He reigned for twenty-one years (B.C. 486-465). He invaded Greece with an army, it is said, of more than 2,000,000 soldiers, only 5,000 of whom returned with him. Leonidas, with his famous 300, arrested his progress at the Pass of Thermopylae, and then he was defeated disastrously by Themistocles at Salamis. It was after his return from this invasion that Esther was chosen as his queen.   </li>
Ahava	<p>water, the river ( Ezra 8:21 ) by the banks of which the Jewish exiles assembled under Ezra when about to return to Jerusalem from Babylon. In all probability this was one of the streams of Mesopotamia which flowed into the Euphrates somewhere in the north-west of Babylonia. It has, however, been supposed to be the name of a place ( Ezra 8:15 ) now called Hit, on the Euphrates, east of Damascus.  </p>
Ahaz	<p>possessor. </p><li> A grandson of Jonathan ( 1 Chronicles 8:35 ;  9:42 ).  </li><li> The son and successor of Jotham, king of Judah ( 2 Kings 16 ;  <span class="badLink">Isaiah 79</span> -9;  2 Chr.  28 ). He gave himself up to a life of wickedness and idolatry. Notwithstanding the remonstrances and warnings of Isaiah, Hosea, and Micah, he appealed for help against Rezin, king of Damascus, and Pekah, king of Israel, who threatened Jerusalem, to Tiglath-pileser, the king of Assyria, to the great injury of his kingdom and his own humilating subjection to the Assyrians ( 2 Kings 16:7 2 Kings 16:9 ;  15:29 ). He also introduced among his people many heathen and idolatrous customs ( Isaiah 8:19 ;  38:8 ;  2 Kings  23:12 ). He died at the age of thirty-five years, after reigning sixteen years (B.C. 740-724), and was succeeded by his son Hezekiah. Because of his wickedness he was "not brought into the sepulchre of the kings."   </li>
Ahaziah	<p>held by Jehovah. </p><li> The son and successor of Ahab. He followed the counsels of his mother Jezebel, and imitated in wickedness the ways of his father. In his reign the Moabites revolted from under his authority ( 2 Kings 3:5-7 ). He united with Jehoshaphat in an attempt to revive maritime trade by the Red Sea, which proved a failure ( 2 Chronicles 20:35-37 ). His messengers, sent to consult the god of Ekron regarding his recovery from the effects of a fall from the roof-gallery of his palace, were met on the way by Elijah, who sent them back to tell the king that he would never rise from his bed ( 1 Kings 22:51 ;  2 Kings  1:18 ).  </li><li> The son of Joram, or Jehoram, and sixth king of Judah. Called Jehoahaz ( 2 Chronicles 21:17 ;  25:23 ), and Azariah ( 2 Chronicles 22:6 ). Guided by his idolatrous mother Athaliah, his reign was disastrous ( 2 Kings 8:24-29 ;  9:29 ). He joined his uncle Jehoram, king of Israel, in an expedition against Hazael, king of Damascus; but was wounded at the pass of Gur when attempting to escape, and had strength only to reach Megiddo, where he died ( 2 Kings 9:22-28 ). He reigned only one year.   </li>
Ahiam	<p>mother's brother, one of David's thirty heroes ( 2 Samuel 23:33 ;  1 Chronicles 11:35 ).  </p>
Ahiezer	<p>brother of help; i.e., "helpful." </p><li> The chief of the tribe of Dan at the time of the Exodus ( Numbers 1:12 ;  2:25 ;  10:25 ).  </li><li> The chief of the Benjamite slingers that repaired to David at Ziklag ( 1 Chronicles 12:3 ).   </li>
Ahihud	<p>brother (i.e., "friend") of union. </p><li> A son of Bela, the son of Benjamin ( 1 Chronicles 8:7 ).  </li><li> Name different in Hebrew, meaning brother of Judah. Chief of the tribe of Asher; one of those appointed by Moses to superintend the division of Canaan among the tribe ( Numbers 34:27 ).   </li>
Ahijah	<p>brother (i.e., "friend") of Jehovah. </p><li> One of the sons of Bela ( 1 Chronicles 8:7 , RSV). In A.V. called "Ahiah."  </li><li> One of the five sons of Jerahmeel, who was great-grandson of Judah ( 1 Chronicles 2:25 ).  </li><li> Son of Ahitub ( 1 Samuel 14:3 1 Samuel 14:18 ), Ichabod's brother; the same probably as Ahimelech, who was high priest at Nob in the reign of Saul ( 1 Samuel 22:11 ). Some, however, suppose that Ahimelech was the brother of Ahijah, and that they both officiated as high priests, Ahijah at Gibeah or Kirjath-jearim, and Ahimelech at Nob.  </li><li> A Pelonite, one of David's heroes ( 1 Chronicles 11:36 ); called also Eliam ( 2 Samuel 23:34 ).  </li><li> A Levite having charge of the sacred treasury in the temple ( 1 Chronicles 26:20 ).  </li><li> One of Solomon's secretaries ( 1 Kings 4:3 ).  </li><li> A prophet of Shiloh ( 1 Kings 11:29 ;  14:2 ), called the "Shilonite," in the days of Rehoboam. We have on record two of his remarkable prophecies,  1 Kings 11:31-39 , announcing the rending of the ten tribes from Solomon; and  1 Kings 14:6-16 , delivered to Jeroboam's wife, foretelling the death of Abijah the king's son, the destruction of Jeroboam's house, and the captivity of Israel "beyond the river." Jeroboam bears testimony to the high esteem in which he was held as a prophet of God ( 1 Kings 14:2 1 Kings 14:3 ).   </li>
Ahikam	<p>brother of support = helper, one of the five whom Josiah sent to consult the prophetess Huldah in connection with the discovery of the book of the law ( 2 Kings 22:12-14 ;  2 Chr  34:20 ). He was the son of Shaphan, the royal secretary, and the father of Gedaliah, governor of Judea after the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians ( 2 Kings 25:22 ;  Jeremiah 40:5-16 ;  43:6 ). On one occasion he protected Jeremiah against the fury of Jehoiakim ( Jeremiah 26:24 ). It was in the chamber of another son (Germariah) of Shaphan that Baruch read in the ears of all the people Jeremiah's roll.  </p>
Ahimaaz	<p>brother of anger = irascible. </p><li> The father Ahinoam, the wife of Saul ( 1 Samuel 14:50 ).  </li><li> The son and successor of Zadok in the office of high priest ( 1 Chronicles 6:8 1 Chronicles 6:53 ). On the occasion of the revolt of Absalom he remained faithful to David, and was of service to him in conveying to him tidings of the proceedings of Absalom in Jerusalem ( 2 Samuel 15:24-37 ;  17:15-21 ). He was swift of foot, and was the first to carry to David tidings of the defeat of Absalom, although he refrained, from delicacy of feeling, from telling him of his death ( 2 Samuel 18:19-33 ).   </li>
Ahiman	<p>brother of a gift = liberal. </p><li> One of the three giant Anakim brothers whom Caleb and the spies saw in Mount Hebron ( Numbers 13:22 ) when they went in to explore the land. They were afterwards driven out and slain ( Joshua 15:14 ;  Judges 1:10 ).  </li><li> One of the guardians of the temple after the Exile ( 1 Chronicles 9:17 ).   </li>
Ahimelech	<p>brother of the king, the son of Ahitub and father of Abiathar ( 1 Samuel 22:20-23 ). He descended from Eli in the line of Ithamar. In  1 Chronicles 18:16  he is called Abimelech, and is probably the same as Ahiah ( 1 Samuel 14:3 1 Samuel 14:18 ). He was the twelfth high priest, and officiated at Nob, where he was visited by David (to whom and his companions he gave five loaves of the showbread) when he fled from Saul ( 1 Samuel 21:1-9 ). He was summoned into Saul's presence, and accused, on the information of Doeg the Edomite, of disloyalty because of his kindness to David; whereupon the king commanded that he, with the other priests who stood beside him (86 in all), should be put to death. This sentence was carried into execution by Doeg in the most cruel manner ( 1 Samuel 22:9-23 ). Possibly Abiathar had a son also called Ahimelech, or the two names, as some think, may have been accidentally transposed in  2 Samuel 8:17 ;  1 Chronicles 18:16 , marg.;  1 Chronicles 24:3 1 Chronicles 24:6 1 Chronicles 24:31 .  </p>
Ahinadab	<p>brother of liberality = liberal, one of the twelve commissariat officers appointed by Solomon in so many districts of his kingdom to raise supplies by monthly rotation for his household. He was appointed to the district of Mahanaim ( 1 Kings 4:14 ), east of Jordan.  </p>
Ahinoam	<p>brother of pleasantness = pleasant. </p><li> The daughter of Ahimaaz, and wife of Saul ( 1 Samuel 14:50 ).  </li><li> A Jezreelitess, the first wife of David ( 1 Samuel 25:43 ;  27:3 ). She was the mother of Amnon ( 2 Samuel 3:2 ). (See   1 Samuel 30:5 1 Samuel 30:18 ;  2 Sam  2:2 .)   </li>
Ahio	<p>brotherly. </p><li> One of the sons of Beriah ( 1 Chronicles 8:14 ).  </li><li> One of the sons of Jehiel the Gibeonite ( 1 Chronicles 8:31 ;  9:37 ).  </li><li> One of the sons of Abinadab the Levite. While Uzzah went by the side of the ark, he walked before it guiding the oxen which drew the cart on which it was carried, after having brought it from his father's house in Gibeah ( 1 Chronicles 13:7 ;  2 Sam  1 Chronicles 6:3 1 Chronicles 6:4 ).   </li>
Ahira	<p>brother of evil = unlucky, or my brother is friend, chief of the tribe of Naphtali at the Exodus ( Numbers 1:15 ;  2:29 ).  </p>
Ahishar	<p>brother of song = singer, the officer who was "over the household" of Solomon ( 1 Kings 4:6 ).  </p>
Ahithophel	<p>brother of insipidity or impiety, a man greatly renowned for his sagacity among the Jews. At the time of Absalom's revolt he deserted David ( Psalms 41:9 ;  55:12-14 ) and espoused the cause of Absalom ( 2 Samuel 15:12 ). David sent his old friend Hushai back to Absalom, in order that he might counteract the counsel of Ahithophel ( 2 Samuel 15:31-37 ). This end was so far gained that Ahithophel saw he had no longer any influence, and accordingly he at once left the camp of Absalom and returned to Giloh, his native place, where, after arranging his wordly affairs, he hanged himself, and was buried in the sepulchre of his fathers ( 2 Samuel 17:1-23 ). He was the type of Judas ( Psalms 41:9 ).  </p>
Ahitub	<p>brother of goodness = good. </p><li> The son of Phinehas. On the death of his grandfather Eli he succeeded to the office of high priest, and was himself succeeded by his son Ahijah ( 1 Samuel 14:3 ;  1 Samuel 22:9 1 Samuel 22:11 1 Samuel 22:12 1 Samuel 22:20 ).  </li><li> The father of Zadok, who was made high priest by Saul after the extermination of the family of Ahimelech ( 1 Chronicles 6:7 1 Chronicles 6:8 ;  2 Sam  8:17 ).   </li>
Ahlab	<p>fatness, a town of Asher lying within the unconquered Phoenician border ( Judges 1:31 ), north-west of the Sea of Galilee; commonly identified with Giscala, now el-Jish.  </p>
Ahoah	<p>brotherly, one of the sons of Bela, the son of Benjamin ( 1 Chronicles 8:4 ). He is also called Ahiah (ver. 7) and Iri ( 1 Chronicles 7:7 ). His descendants were called Ahohites ( 2 Samuel 23:9 2 Samuel 23:28 ).  </p>
Ahohite	<p>an epithet applied to Dodo, one of Solomon's captains ( 1 Chronicles 27:4 ); to his son Eleazar, one of David's three mightiest heroes ( 2 Samuel 23:9 ;  1 Chronicles 11:12 ); and to Zalmon, one of the thirty ( 2 Samuel 23:28 ;  1 Chronicles 11:29 ), from their descent from Ahoah.  </p>
Aholah	<p>she has her own tent, a name used by ( Ezekiel 23:4 Ezekiel 23:5 Ezekiel 23:36 Ezekiel 23:44 ) as a symbol of the idolatry of the kingdom of Israel. This kingdom is described as a lewdwoman, an adulteress, given up to the abominations and idolatries of the Egyptians and Assyrians. Because of her crimes, she was carried away captive, and ceased to be a kingdom. (Compare  Psalms 78:67-69 ;  1 Kings 12:25-33 ;  2 Chr.  11:13-16 .)  </p>
Aholiab	<p>tent of the father, an artist of the tribe of Dan, appointed to the work of preparing materials for the tabernacle ( Exodus 31:6 ;  35:34 ;  Exodus 36:1 Exodus 36:2 ;  38:23 ).  </p>
Aholibah	<p>my tent is in her, the name of an imaginary harlot, applied symbolically to Jerusalem, because she had abandoned the worship of the true God and given herself up to the idolatries of foreign nations. ( Ezekiel 23:4 Ezekiel 23:11 Ezekiel 23:22 Ezekiel 23:36 Ezekiel 23:44 ).  </p>
Aholibamah	<p>tent of the height, the name given to Judith, the daughter of Beeri = Anah ( Genesis 26:34 ;  36:2 ), when she became the wife of Esau. A district among the mountains of Edom, probably near Mount Hor, was called after her name, or it may be that she received her name from the district. From her descended three tribes of Edomites, founded by her three sons.  </p>
Ai	<p>ruins. </p><li> One of the royal cities of the Canaanites ( Joshua 10:1 ;  Genesis 12:8 ;  13:3 ). It was the scene of Joshua's defeat, and afterwards of his victory. It was the second Canaanite city taken by Israel ( Joshua 7:2-5 ;  8:1-29 ). It lay rebuilt and inhibited by the Benjamites ( Ezra 2:28 ;  Nehemiah 7:32 ;  11:31 ). It lay to the east of Bethel, "beside Beth-aven." The spot which is most probably the site of this ancient city is Haiyan, 2 miles east from Bethel. It lay up the Wady Suweinit, a steep, rugged valley, extending from the Jordan valley to Bethel.  </li><li> A city in the Ammonite territory ( Jeremiah 49:3 ). Some have thought that the proper reading of the word is Ar ( Isaiah 15:1 ).   </li>
Aijeleth Shahar	<p>hind of the dawn, a name found in the title of  Psalms 22 . It is probably the name of some song or tune to the measure of which the psalm was to be chanted. Some, however, understand by the name some instrument of music, or an allegorical allusion to the subject of the psalm.  </p>
Air	<p>the atmosphere, as opposed to the higher regions of the sky ( 1 Thessalonians 4:17 ;  Revelation 9:2 ;  16:17 ). This word occurs once as the rendering of the Hebrew <i> ruah</i> ( Job 41:16 ); elsewhere it is the rendering of <i> shamaiyim</i> , usually translated "heavens." </p><p> The expression "to speak into the air" ( 1 Corinthians 14:9 ) is a proverb denoting to speak in vain, as to "beat the air" ( 1 Corinthians 9:26 ) denotes to labour in vain.  </p>
Ajalon	<p>and Aij'alon, place of deer. </p><li> A town and valley originally assigned to the tribe of Dan, from which, however, they could not drive the Amorites ( Judges 1:35 ). It was one of the Levitical cities given to the Kohathites ( 1 Chronicles 6:69 ). It was not far from Beth-shemesh ( 2 Chronicles 28:18 ). It was the boundary between the kingdoms of Judah and Israel, and is frequently mentioned in Jewish history ( 2 Chronicles 11:10 ;  1 Samuel 14:31 ;  1 Chronicles 8:13 ). With reference to the valley named after the town, Joshua uttered the celebrated command, "Sun, stand thou still on Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon" ( Joshua 10:12 ). It has been identified as the modern Yalo, at the foot of the Beth-horon pass (q.v.). In the Tell Amarna letters Adoni-zedek (q.v.) speaks of the destruction of the "city of Ajalon" by the invaders, and describes himself as "afflicted, greatly afflicted" by the calamities that had come on the land, urging the king of Egypt to hasten to his help.  </li><li> A city in the tribe of Zebulun ( Judges 12:12 ), the modern Jalun, three miles north of Cabul.   </li>
Akkub	<p>(another form of Jacob). </p><li> The head of one of the families of Nethinim ( Ezra 2:45 ).  </li><li> A Levite who kept the gate of the temple after the return from Babylon ( 1 Chronicles 9:17 ;  Ezra 2:42 ;  Nehemiah 7:45 ).  </li><li> A descendant of David ( 1 Chronicles 3:24 ).   </li>
Akrabbim	<p>scorpions, probably the general name given to the ridge containing the pass between the south of the Dead Sea and Zin, es-Sufah, by which there is an ascent to the level of the land of Palestine. Scorpions are said to abound in this whole district, and hence the name ( Numbers 34:4 ). It is called "Maaleh-acrabbim" in  Joshua 15:3 , and "the ascent of Akrabbim" in  Numbers 34:4 .  </p>
Alabaster	<p>occurs only in the New Testament in connection with the box of "ointment of spikenard very precious," with the contents of which a woman anointed the head of Jesus as he sat at supper in the house of Simon the leper ( Matthew 26:7 ;  Mark 14:3 ;  Luke 7:37 ). These boxes were made from a stone found near Alabastron in Egypt, and from this circumstance the Greeks gave them the name of the city where they were made. The name was then given to the stone of which they were made; and finally to all perfume vessels, of whatever material they were formed. The woman "broke" the vessel; i.e., she broke off, as was usually done, the long and narrow neck so as to reach the contents. This stone resembles marble, but is softer in its texture, and hence very easily wrought into boxes. Mark says ( 14:5 ) that this box of ointment was worth more than 300 pence, i.e., denarii, each of the value of sevenpence halfpenny of our money, and therefore worth about 10 pounds. But if we take the denarius as the day's wage of a labourer ( Matthew 20:2 ), say two shillings of our money, then the whole would be worth about 30 pounds, so costly was Mary's offering.  </p>
Alamoth	<p>virgins, a musical term ( 1 Chronicles 15:20 ), denoting that the psalm which bears this inscription ( Psalms 46 ) was to be sung by soprano or female voices.  </p>
Alarm	<p>a particular quivering sound of the silver trumpets to give warning to the Hebrews on their journey through the wilderness ( Numbers 10:5 Numbers 10:6 ), a call to arms, or a war-note ( Jeremiah 4:19 ;  49:2 ;  Zephaniah 1:16 ).  </p>
Alemeth	<p>covering. </p><li> One of the nine sons of Becher, the son of Benjamin ( 1 Chronicles 7:8 ).  </li><li> One of the sons of Jehoadah, or Jarah, son of Ahaz ( 1 Chronicles 8:36 ).  </li><li> A sacerdotal city of Benjamin ( 1 Chronicles 6:60 ), called also Almon ( Joshua 21:18 ), now Almit, a mile north-east of the ancient Anathoth.   </li>
Alexander	<p>man-defender. </p><li> A relative of Annas the high priest, present when Peter and John were examined before the Sanhedrim ( Acts 4:6 ).  </li><li> A man whose father, Simon the Cyrenian, bore the cross of Christ ( Mark 15:21 ).  </li><li> A Jew of Ephesus who took a prominent part in the uproar raised there by the preaching of Paul ( Acts 19:33 ). The Jews put him forward to plead their cause before the mob. It was probably intended that he should show that he and the other Jews had no sympathy with Paul any more than the Ephesians had. It is possible that this man was the same as the following.  </li><li> A coppersmith who, with Hymenaeus and others, promulgated certain heresies regarding the resurrection ( 1 Timothy 1:19 ;  2 Tim.  4:14 ), and made shipwreck of faith and of a good conscience. Paul excommunicated him ( 1 Timothy 1:20 ; Compare  1 Corinthians 5:5 ).   </li>
Alexander the Great	<p>the king of Macedonia, the great conqueror; probably represented in Daniel by the "belly of brass" ( Daniel 2:32 ), and the leopard and the he-goat ( 7:6 ;  Daniel 11:3 Daniel 11:4 ). He succeeded his father Philip, and died at the age of thirty-two from the effects of intemperance, B.C. 323. His empire was divided among his four generals.  </p>
Alexandria	<p>the ancient metropolis of Lower Egypt, so called from its founder, Alexander the Great (about B.C. 333). It was for a long period the greatest of existing cities, for both Nineveh and Babylon had been destroyed, and Rome had not yet risen to greatness. It was the residence of the kings of Egypt for 200 years. It is not mentioned in the Old Testament, and only incidentally in the New. Apollos, eloquent and mighty in the Scriptures, was a native of this city ( Acts 18:24 ). Many Jews from Alexandria were in Jerusalem, where they had a synagogue ( Acts 6:9 ), at the time of Stephen's martyrdom. At one time it is said that as many as 10,000 Jews resided in this city. It possessed a famous library of 700,000 volumes, which was burned by the Saracens (A.D. 642). It was here that the Hebrew Bible was translated into Greek. This is called the Septuagint version, from the tradition that seventy learned men were engaged in executing it. It was, however, not all translated at one time. It was begun B.C. 280, and finished about B.C. 200 or 150. (See VERSION .) </p>
Algum	<p>( 2 Chronicles 2:8 ;  2 Chronicles 9:10 2 Chronicles 9:11 ), the same as almug ( 1 Kings 10:11 ).  </p>
Alien	<p>a foreigner, or person born in another country, and therefore not entitled to the rights and privileges of the country where he resides. Among the Hebrews there were two classes of aliens. </p><li> Those who were strangers generally, and who owned no landed property.  </li><li> Strangers dwelling in another country without being naturalized ( Leviticus 22:10 ;  Psalms 39:12 ).  <p> Both of these classes were to enjoy, under certain conditions, the same rights as other citizens ( Leviticus 19:33 Leviticus 19:34 ;  Deuteronomy 10:19 ). They might be naturalized and permitted to enter into the congregation of the Lord by submitting to circumcision and abandoning idolatry ( Deuteronomy 23:3-8 ).  </p><p> This term is used ( Ephesians 2:12 ) to denote persons who have no interest in Christ.  </p> </li>
Allegory	<p>used only in  Galatians 4:24 , where the apostle refers to the history of Isaac the free-born, and Ishmael the slave-born, and makes use of it allegorically.  </p><p> Every parable is an allegory. Nathan ( 2 Samuel 12:1-4 ) addresses David in an allegorical narrative. In the eightieth Psalm there is a beautiful allegory: "Thou broughtest a vine out of Egypt," etc. In Eccl  12:2-6 , there is a striking allegorical description of old age.  </p>
Alleluia	<p>the Greek form ( Revelation 19:1 Revelation 19:3 Revelation 19:4 Revelation 19:6 ) of the Hebrew Hallelujah = Praise ye Jehovah, which begins or ends several of the psalms (106,111,112,113, etc.).  </p>
Alliance	<p>a treaty between nations, or between individuals, for their mutual advantage. </p><p> Abraham formed an alliance with some of the Canaanitish princes ( Genesis 14:13 ), also with Abimelech ( 21:22-32 ). Joshua and the elders of Israel entered into an alliance with the Gibeonites ( Joshua 9:3-27 ). When the Israelites entered Palestine they were forbidden to enter into alliances with the inhabitants of the country ( Leviticus 18:3 Leviticus 18:4 ;  Leviticus 20:22 Leviticus 20:23 ).  </p><p> Solomon formed a league with Hiram ( 1 Kings 5:12 ). This "brotherly covenant" is referred to 250 years afterwards ( Amos 1:9 ). He also appears to have entered into an alliance with Pharaoh ( 1 Kings 10:28 1 Kings 10:29 ).  </p><p> In the subsequent history of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel various alliances were formed between them and also with neighbouring nations at different times. </p><p> From patriarchal times a covenant of alliance was sealed by the blood of some sacrificial victim. The animal sacrificed was cut in two (except birds), and between these two parts the persons contracting the alliance passed ( Genesis 15:10 ). There are frequent allusions to this practice ( Jeremiah 34:18 ). Such alliances were called "covenants of salt" ( Numbers 18:19 ;  2 Chr  13:5 ), salt being the symbol of perpetuity. A pillar was set up as a memorial of the alliance between Laban and Jacob ( Genesis 31:52 ). The Jews throughout their whole history attached great importance to fidelity to their engagements. Divine wrath fell upon the violators of them ( Joshua 9:18 ;  2 Sam  Joshua 21:1 Joshua 21:2 ; Ezek.  17:16 ).  </p>
Allon	<p>oak. </p><li> The expression in the Authorized Version of  Joshua 19:33 , "from Allon to Zaanannim," is more correctly rendered in the Revised Version, "from the oak in Zaanannim." The word denotes some remarkable tree which stood near Zaanannim, and which served as a landmark.  </li><li> The son of Jedaiah, of the family of the Simeonites, who expelled the Hamites from the valley of Gedor ( 1 Chronicles 4:37 ).   </li>
Allon-bachuth	<p>oak of weeping, a tree near Bethel, at the spot where Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, was buried ( Genesis 35:8 ). Large trees, from their rarity in the plains of Palestine, were frequently designated as landmarks. This particular tree was probably the same as the "palm tree of Deborah" ( Judges 4:5 ).  </p>
Almodad	<p>immeasurable, the first named of the sons of Joktan ( Genesis 10:26 ), the founder of an Arabian tribe.  </p>
Almon	<p>hidden, one of the sacerdotal cities of Benjamin ( Joshua 21:18 ), called also Alemeth ( 1 Chronicles 6:60 ).  </p>
Almond	<p>a native of Syria and Palestine. In form, blossoms, and fruit it resembles the peach tree. Its blossoms are of a very pale pink colour, and appear before its leaves. Its Hebrew name, <i> shaked</i> , signifying "wakeful, hastening," is given to it on account of its putting forth its blossoms so early, generally in February, and sometimes even in January. In Eccl  12:5 , it is referred to as illustrative, probably, of the haste with which old age comes. There are others, however, who still contend for the old interpretation here. "The almond tree bears its blossoms in the midst of winter, on a naked, leafless stem, and these blossoms (reddish or flesh-coloured in the beginning) seem at the time of their fall exactly like white snow-flakes. In this way the almond blossom is a very fitting symbol of old age, with its silvery hair and its wintry, dry, barren, unfruitful condition." In  Jeremiah 1:11  "I see a rod of an almond tree [shaked]...for I will hasten [shaked] my word to perform it" the word is used as an emblem of promptitude. Jacob desired his sons ( Genesis 43:11 ) to take with them into Egypt of the best fruits of the land, almonds, etc., as a present to Joseph, probably because this tree was not a native of Egypt. Aaron's rod yielded almonds ( Numbers 17:8 ;  Hebrews 9:4 ). Moses was directed to make certain parts of the candlestick for the ark of carved work "like unto almonds" ( Exodus 25:33 Exodus 25:34 ). The Hebrew word <i> luz</i> , translated "hazel" in the Authorized Version ( Genesis 30:37 ), is rendered in the Revised Version "almond." It is probable that <i> luz</i> denotes the wild almond, while <i> shaked</i> denotes the cultivated variety. </p>
Alms	<p>Not found in the Old Testament, but repeatedly in the New. The Mosaic legislation ( Leviticus 25:35 ;  Deuteronomy 15:7 ) tended to promote a spirit of charity, and to prevent the occurrence of destitution among the people. Such passages as these,  Psalms 41:1 ;  112:9 ;  Proverbs 14:31 ;  Isaiah 10:2 ;  Amos 2:7 ;  Jeremiah 5:28 ;  Ezekiel 22:29 , would also naturally foster the same benevolent spirit.  </p><p> In the time of our Lord begging was common ( Mark 10:46 ;  Acts 3:2 ). The Pharisees were very ostentatious in their almsgivings ( Matthew 6:2 ). The spirit by which the Christian ought to be actuated in this duty is set forth in  1 John 3:17 . A regard to the state of the poor and needy is enjoined as a Christian duty ( Luke 3:11 ;  6:30 ;  Matthew 6:1 ;  Acts 9:36 ;  Acts 10:2 Acts 10:4 ), a duty which was not neglected by the early Christians ( Luke 14:13 ;  Acts 20:35 ;  Galatians 2:10 ;  Romans 15:25-27 ;  1 Corinthians 16:1-4 ). They cared not only for the poor among themselves, but contributed also to the necessities of those at a distance ( Acts 11:29 ;  24:17 ;  2 co.  9:12 ). Our Lord and his attendants showed an example also in this ( John 13:29 ).  </p><p> In modern times the "poor-laws" have introduced an element which modifies considerably the form in which we may discharge this Christian duty. </p>
Almug	<p>( 1 Kings 10:11 1 Kings 10:12 ) = algum ( 2 Chronicles 2:8 ;  2 Chronicles 9:10 2 Chronicles 9:11 ), in the Hebrew occurring only in the plural <i> almuggim</i> (indicating that the wood was brought in planks), the name of a wood brought from Ophir to be used in the building of the temple, and for other purposes. Some suppose it to have been the white sandal-wood of India, the Santalum album of botanists, a native of the mountainous parts of the Malabar coasts. It is a fragrant wood, and is used in China for incense in idol-worship. Others, with some probability, think that it was the Indian red sandal-wood, the pterocarpus santalinus, a heavy, fine-grained wood, the Sanscrit name of which is valguka. It is found on the Coromandel coast and in Ceylon. </p>
Aloes	<p>(Heb. 'ahalim), a fragrant wood ( Numbers 24:6 ;  Psalms 45:8 ;  Proverbs 7:17 ; Cant  4:14 ), the Aquilaria agallochum of botanists, or, as some suppose, the costly gum or perfume extracted from the wood. It is found in China, Siam, and Northern India, and grows to the height sometimes of 120 feet. This species is of great rarity even in India. There is another and more common species, called by Indians aghil, whence Europeans have given it the name of Lignum aquile, or eagle-wood. Aloewood was used by the Egyptians for embalming dead bodies. Nicodemus brought it (pounded aloe-wood) to embalm the body of Christ ( John 19:39 ); but whether this was the same as that mentioned elsewhere is uncertain.  </p><p> The bitter aloes of the apothecary is the dried juice of the leaves Aloe vulgaris. </p>
Alphaeus	<p></p><li> The father of James the Less, the apostle and writer of the epistle ( Matthew 10:3 ;  Mark 3:18 ;  Luke 6:15 ;  Acts 1:13 ), and the husband of Mary ( John 19:25 ). The Hebrew form of this name is Cleopas, or Clopas (q.v.).  </li><li> The father of Levi, or Matthew ( Mark 2:14 ).   </li>
Altar	<p>(Heb. mizbe'ah, from a word meaning "to slay"), any structure of earth ( Exodus 20:24 ) or unwrought stone ( 20:25 ) on which sacrifices were offered. Altars were generally erected in conspicuous places ( Genesis 22:9 ;  Ezekiel 6:3 ;  2 Kings  23:12 ;  16:4 ;  23:8 ;  Acts 14:13 ). The word is used in  Hebrews 13:10  for the sacrifice offered upon it--the sacrifice Christ offered.  </p><p> Paul found among the many altars erected in Athens one bearing the inscription, "To the unknown God" ( Acts 17:23 ), or rather "to an [i.e., some] unknown God." The reason for this inscription cannot now be accurately determined. It afforded the apostle the occasion of proclaiming the gospel to the "men of Athens."  </p><p> The first altar we read of is that erected by Noah ( Genesis 8:20 ). Altars were erected by Abraham ( Genesis 12:7 ;  13:4 ;  22:9 ), by Isaac ( Genesis 26:25 ), by Jacob ( 33:20 ;  Genesis 35:1 Genesis 35:3 ), and by Moses ( Exodus 17:15 , "Jehovah-nissi").  </p><p> In the tabernacle, and afterwards in the temple, two altars were erected. </p><li> The altar of burnt offering ( Exodus 30:28 ), called also the "brasen altar" ( Exodus 39:39 ) and "the table of the Lord" ( Malachi 1:7 ).  <p> This altar, as erected in the tabernacle, is described in  Exodus 27:1-8 . It was a hollow square, 5 cubits in length and in breadth, and 3 cubits in height. It was made of shittim wood, and was overlaid with plates of brass. Its corners were ornamented with "horns" ( Exodus 29:12 ;  Leviticus 4:18 ).  </p><p> In  Exodus 27:3  the various utensils appertaining to the altar are enumerated. They were made of brass. (Compare  1 Samuel 2:13 1 Samuel 2:14 ;  Leviticus 16:12 ;  Numbers 16:6 Numbers 16:7 .)  </p><p> In Solomon's temple the altar was of larger dimensions ( 2 Chronicles 4:1 . Compare  1 Kings 8:22 1 Kings 8:64 ;  9:25 ), and was made wholly of brass, covering a structure of stone or earth. This altar was renewed by Asa ( 2 Chronicles 15:8 ). It was removed by Ahaz ( 2 Kings 16:14 ), and "cleansed" by Hezekiah, in the latter part of whose reign it was rebuilt. It was finally broken up and carried away by the Babylonians ( Jeremiah 52:17 ).  </p><p> After the return from captivity it was re-erected ( Ezra 3:3 Ezra 3:6 ) on the same place where it had formerly stood. (Compare 1Macc.  <span class="badLink">4:47</span> .) When Antiochus Epiphanes pillaged Jerusalem the altar of burnt offering was taken away.  </p><p> Again the altar was erected by Herod, and remained in its place till the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans (70 A.D.).  </p><p> The fire on the altar was not permitted to go out ( Leviticus 6:9 ).  </p><p> In the Mosque of Omar, immediately underneath the great dome, which occupies the site of the old temple, there is a rough projection of the natural rock, of about 60 feet in its extreme length, and 50 in its greatest breadth, and in its highest part about 4 feet above the general pavement. This rock seems to have been left intact when Solomon's temple was built. It was in all probability the site of the altar of burnt offering. Underneath this rock is a cave, which may probably have been the granary of Araunah's threshing-floor ( 1 Chronicles 21:22 ).  </p></li><li> The altar of incense ( Exodus 30:1-10 ), called also "the golden altar" ( 39:38 ;  Numbers 4:11 ), stood in the holy place "before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony." On this altar sweet spices were continually burned with fire taken from the brazen altar. The morning and the evening services were commenced by the high priest offering incense on this altar. The burning of the incense was a type of prayer ( Psalms 141:2 ;  Revelation 5:8 ;  Revelation 8:3 Revelation 8:4 ).  <p> This altar was a small movable table, made of acacia wood overlaid with gold ( Exodus 37:25 Exodus 37:26 ). It was 1 cubit in length and breadth, and 2 cubits in height.  </p><p> In Solomon's temple the altar was similar in size, but was made of cedar-wood ( 1 Kings 6:20 ;  7:48 ) overlaid with gold. In  Ezekiel 41:22  it is called "the altar of wood." (Compare  Exodus 30:1-6 .)  </p><p> In the temple built after the Exile the altar was restored. Antiochus Epiphanes took it away, but it was afterwards restored by Judas Maccabaeus (1Macc  <span class="badLink">1:23</span> ;  <span class="badLink">4:49</span> ). Among the trophies carried away by Titus on the destruction of Jerusalem the altar of incense is not found, nor is any mention made of it in  Hebrews 9 . It was at this altar Zacharias ministered when an angel appeared to him ( Luke 1:11 ). It is the only altar which appears in the heavenly temple ( Isaiah 6:6 ;  Revelation 8:3 Revelation 8:4 ).  </p> </li>
Altaschith	<p>destroy not, the title of  <span class="badLink">Psalms 575859</span> ,58,59, and 75. It was probably the name of some song to the melody of which these psalms were to be chanted.  </p>
Alush	<p>one of the places, the last before Rephidim, at which the Hebrews rested on their way to Sinai ( Numbers 33:13 Numbers 33:14 ). It was probably situated on the shore of the Red Sea.  </p>
Amalek	<p>dweller in a valley, the son of Eliphaz and grandson of Esau ( Genesis 36:12 ;  1 Chronicles 1:36 ); the chief of an Idumean tribe ( Genesis 36:16 ). His mother was a Horite, a tribe whose territory the descendants of Esau had seized.  </p>
Amalekite	<p>a tribe that dwelt in Arabia Petraea, between the Dead Sea and the Red Sea. They were not the descendants of Amalek, the son of Eliphaz, for they existed in the days of Abraham ( Genesis 14:7 ). They were probably a tribe that migrated from the shores of the Persian Gulf and settled in Arabia. "They dwelt in the land of the south...from Havilah until thou comest to Shur" ( Numbers 13:29 ;  1 Samuel 15:7 ). They were a pastoral, and hence a nomadic race. Their kings bore the hereditary name of Agag ( Numbers 24:7 ;  1 Samuel 15:8 ). They attempted to stop the Israelites when they marched through their territory ( Deuteronomy 25:18 ), attacking them at Rephidim ( Exodus 17:8-13 ; Compare  Deuteronomy 25:17 ;  1 Samuel 15:2 ). They afterwards attacked the Israelites at Hormah ( Numbers 14:45 ). We read of them subsequently as in league with the Moabites (Judg.  3:13 ) and the Midianites ( Judges 6:3 ). Saul finally desolated their territory and destroyed their power ( 1 Samuel 14:48 ;  15:3 ), and David recovered booty from them ( 1 Samuel 30:18-20 ). In the Babylonian inscriptions they are called Sute, in those of Egypt Sittiu, and the Amarna tablets include them under the general name of Khabbati, or "plunderers."  </p>
Amana	<p>perennial. </p><li> The Hebrew margin of  2 Kings 5:12  gives this as another reading of Abana (q.v.), a stream near Damascus.  </li><li> A mountain (Cant  4:8 ), probably the southern summit of Anti-Libanus, at the base of which are the sources of the Abana.   </li>
Amariah	<p>said by Jehovah. </p><li> One of the descendants of Aaron by Eleazar ( 1 Chronicles 6:7 1 Chronicles 6:52 ). He was probably the last of the high priests of Eleazar's line prior to the transfer of that office to Eli, of the line of Ithamar.  </li><li> A Levite, son of Hebron, of the lineage of Moses ( 1 Chronicles 23:19 ;  24:23 ).  </li><li> A "chief priest" who took an active part in the reformation under Jehoshaphat ( 2 Chronicles 19:11 ); probably the same as mentioned in  1 Chronicles 6:9 .  </li><li> 1 Chronicles 6:11 ;  Ezra 7:3 . </li><li> One of the high priests in the time of Hezekiah ( 2 Chronicles 31:15 ). </li><li> Zephaniah 1:1 . </li><li> Nehemiah 11:4 . </li><li> Nehemiah 10:3 . </li><li> Ezra 10:42 .   </li>
Baal	<p>lord. </p><li> The name appropriated to the principal male god of the Phoenicians. It is found in several places in the plural BAALIM ( Judges 2:11 ;  10:10 ;  1 Kings 18:18 ;  Jeremiah 2:23 ;  Hosea 2:17 ). Baal is identified with Molech ( Jeremiah 19:5 ). It was known to the Israelites as Baal-peor ( Numbers 25:3 ;  Deuteronomy 4:3 ), was worshipped till the time of Samuel ( 1 Samuel 7:4 ), and was afterwards the religion of the ten tribes in the time of Ahab ( 1 Kings 16:31-33 ;  1 Kings 18:19 1 Kings 18:22 ). It prevailed also for a time in the kingdom of Judah ( 2 Kings 8:27 ; comp  11:18 ;  16:3 ;  2 Chr  28:2 ), till finally put an end to by the severe discipline of the Captivity ( Zephaniah 1:4-6 ). The priests of Baal were in great numbers ( 1 Kings 18:19 ), and of various classes ( 2 Kings 10:19 ). Their mode of offering sacrifices is described in  1 Kings 18:25-29 . The sun-god, under the general title of Baal, or "lord," was the chief object of worship of the Canaanites. Each locality had its special Baal, and the various local Baals were summed up under the name of Baalim, or "lords." Each Baal had a wife, who was a colourless reflection of himself.  </li><li> A Benjamite, son of Jehiel, the progenitor of the Gibeonites ( 1 Chronicles 8:30 ;  9:36 ).  </li><li> The name of a place inhabited by the Simeonites, the same probably as Baal-ath-beer ( 1 Chronicles 4:33 ;  Joshua 19:8 ).   </li>
Baalah	<p>mistress; city. </p><li> A city in the south of Judah ( Joshua 15:29 ), elsewhere called Balah ( Joshua 19:3 ) and Bilhah ( 1 Chronicles 4:29 ). Now Khurbet Zebalah.  </li><li> A city on the northern border of the tribe of Judah ( Joshua 15:10 ), called also Kirjath-jearim, q.v. ( 15:9 ;  1 Chronicles 13:6 ), now Kuriet-el-Enab, or as some think, 'Erma.  </li><li> A mountain on the north-western boundary of Judah and Dan ( Joshua 15:11 ).   </li>
Baalath	<p>a town of the tribe of Dan ( Joshua 19:44 ). It was fortified by Solomon ( 1 Kings 9:18 ;  2 Chr  8:6 ). Some have identified it with Bel'ain, in Wady Deir Balut.  </p>
Baalath-beer	<p>Baalah of the well, ( Joshua 19:8 , probably the same as Baal, mentioned in  1 Chronicles 4:33 , a city of Simeon.  </p>
Baalbec	<p>called by the Greeks Heliopolis i.e., "the city of the sun", because of its famous Temple of the Sun, has by some been supposed to be Solomon's "house of the forest of Lebanon" ( 1 Kings 7:2 ;  10:17 ;  2 Chr  9:16 ); by others it is identified with Baal-gad (q.v.). It was a city of Coele-Syria, on the lowest declivity of Anti-Libanus, about 42 miles north-west of Damascus. It was one of the most splendid of Syrian cities, existing from a remote antiquity. After sustaining several sieges under the Moslems and others, it was finally destroyed by an earthquake in 1759. Its ruins are of great extent.  </p>
Baal-berith	<p>covenant lord, the name of the god worshipped in Shechem after the death of Gideon ( Judges 8:33 ;  9:4 ). In  9:46  he is called simply "the god Berith." The name denotes the god of the covenant into which the Israelites entered with the Canaanites, contrary to the command of Jehovah ( Exodus 34:12 ), when they began to fall away to the worship of idols.  </p>
Baale of Judah	<p>lords of Judah, a city in the tribe of Judah from which David brought the ark into Jerusalem ( 2 Samuel 6:2 ). Elsewhere ( 1 Chronicles 13:6 ) called Kirjath-jearim. (See BAALAH .) </p>
Baal-gad	<p>lord of fortune, or troop of Baal, a Canaanite city in the valley of Lebanon at the foot of Hermon, hence called Baal-hermon (Judge  3:3 ;  1 Chronicles 5:23 ), near the source of the Jordan ( Joshua 13:5 ;  11:17 ;  12:7 ). It was the most northern point to which Joshua's conquests extended. It probably derived its name from the worship of Baal. Its modern representative is Banias. Some have supposed it to be the same as Baalbec.  </p>
Baal-hamon	<p>place of a multitude, a place where Solomon had an extensive vineyard (Cant  8:11 ). It has been supposed to be identical with Baal-gad, and also with Hammon in the tribe of Asher ( Joshua 19:28 ). Others identify it with Belamon, in Central Palestine, near Dothaim.  </p>
Baal-hanan	<p>lord of grace. </p><li> A king of Edom, son of Achbor ( Genesis 36:38 Genesis 36:39 ;  1 Chronicles 1:49 1 Chronicles 1:50 ).  </li><li> An overseer of "the olive trees and sycomore trees in the low plains" (the Shephelah) under David ( 1 Chronicles 27:28 ).   </li>
Baal-hazor	<p>having a courtyard, or Baal's village, the place on the borders of Ephraim and Benjamin where Absalom held the feast of sheep-shearing when Amnon was assassinated ( 2 Samuel 13:23 ). Probably it is the same with Hazor ( Nehemiah 11:33 ), now Tell' Asur, 5 miles north-east of Bethel.  </p>
Baal-hermon	<p>lord of Hermon. </p><li> A city near Mount Hermon inhabited by the Ephraimites ( 1 Chronicles 5:23 ). Probably identical with Baal-gad ( Joshua 11:17 ).  </li><li> A mountain east of Lebanon ( Judges 3:3 ). Probably it may be the same as Mount Hermon, or one of its three peaks.   </li>
Baali	<p>my lord, a title the prophet ( Hosea 2:16 ) reproaches the Jewish church for applying to Jehovah, instead of the more endearing title Ishi, meaning "my husband."  </p>
Baalim	<p>plural of Baal; images of the god Baal ( Judges 2:11 ;  1 Samuel 7:4 ).  </p>
Baalis	<p>king of the Ammonites at the time of the Babylonian captivity ( Jeremiah 40:14 ). He hired Ishmael to slay Gedaliah who had been appointed governor over the cities of Judah.  </p>
Baal-meon	<p>lord of dwelling, a town of Reuben ( Numbers 32:38 ), called also Beth-meon ( Jeremiah 48:23 ) and Beth-baal-meon ( Joshua 13:17 ). It is supposed to have been the birth-place of Elisha. It is identified with the modern M'ain, about 3 miles south-east of Heshbon.  </p>
Baal-peor	<p>lord of the opening, a god of the Moabites ( Numbers 25:3 ;  31:16 ;  Joshua 22:17 ), worshipped by obscene rites. So called from Mount Peor, where this worship was celebrated, the Baal of Peor. The Israelites fell into the worship of this idol ( Numbers 25:3 Numbers 25:5 Numbers 25:18 ;  Deuteronomy 4:3 ;  Psalms 106:28 ;  Hosea 9:10 ).  </p>
Baal-perazim	<p>Baal having rents, bursts, or destructions, the scene of a victory gained by David over the Philistines ( 2 Samuel 5:20 ;  1 Chronicles 14:11 ). Called Mount Perazim ( Isaiah 28:21 ). It was near the valley of Rephaim, west of Jerusalem. Identified with the modern Jebel Aly.  </p>
Baal-shalisha	<p>lord of Shalisha, a place from which a man came with provisions for Elisha, apparently not far from Gilgal ( 2 Kings 4:42 ). It has been identified with Sirisia, 13 miles north of Lydda.  </p>
Baal-tamar	<p>lord of palm trees, a place in the tribe of Benjamin near Gibeah of Saul ( Judges 20:33 ). It was one of the sanctuaries or groves of Baal. Probably the palm tree of Deborah ( Judges 4:5 ) is alluded to in the name.  </p>
Baal-zebub	<p>fly-lord, the god of the Philistines at Ekron ( 2 Kings 1:2 2 Kings 1:3 2 Kings 1:16 ). This name was given to the god because he was supposed to be able to avert the plague of flies which in that region was to be feared. He was consulted by Ahaziah as to his recovery.  </p>
Baal-zephon	<p>Baal of the north, an Egyptian town on the shores of the Gulf of Suez ( Exodus 14:2 ;  Numbers 33:7 ), over against which the children of Israel encamped before they crossed the Red Sea. It is probably to be identified with the modern Jebel Deraj or Kulalah, on the western shore of the Gulf of Suez. Baal-zapuna of the Egyptians was a place of worship.  </p>
Baana	<p>son of affliction. </p><li> One of Solomon's purveyors ( 1 Kings 4:12 ).  </li><li> Son of Hushai, another of Solomon's purveyors ( 1 Kings 4:16 ).  </li><li> Father of Zadok ( Nehemiah 3:4 ).   </li>
Baanah	<p>son of affliction. </p><li> One of the two sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, a captain in Saul's army. He and his brother Rechab assassinated Ishbosheth ( 2 Samuel 4:2 ), and were on this account slain by David, and their mutilated bodies suspended over the pool at Hebron (5,6,12).  </li><li> The father of Heled, who was one of David's thirty heroes ( 2 Samuel 23:29 ;  1 Chronicles 11:30 ).   </li>
Baasha	<p>bravery, the third king of the separate kingdom of Israel, and founder of its second dynasty ( 1 Kings 15 ;  16 ;  2 Chr  16:1-6 ). He was the son of Ahijah of the tribe of Issachar. The city of Tirzah he made the capital of his kingdom, and there he was buried, after an eventful reign of twenty-four years ( 1 Kings 15:33 ). On account of his idolatries his family was exterminated, according to the word of the prophet Jehu ( 1 Kings 16:3 1 Kings 16:4 1 Kings 16:10-13 ).  </p>
Babe	<p>used of children generally ( Matthew 11:25 ;  21:16 ;  Luke 10:21 ;  Romans 2:20 ). It is used also of those who are weak in Christian faith and knowledge ( 1 Corinthians 3:1 ;  Hebrews 5:13 ;  1 Peter 2:2 ). In  Isaiah 3:4  the word "babes" refers to a succession of weak and wicked princes who reigned over Judah from the death of Josiah downward to the destruction of Jerusalem.  </p>
Babel, tower of	<p>the name given to the tower which the primitive fathers of our race built in the land of Shinar after the Deluge ( Genesis 11:1-9 ). Their object in building this tower was probably that it might be seen as a rallying-point in the extensive plain of Shinar, to which they had emigrated from the uplands of Armenia, and so prevent their being scattered abroad. But God interposed and defeated their design by condounding their language, and hence the name Babel, meaning "confusion." In the Babylonian tablets there is an account of this event, and also of the creation and the deluge. (See CHALDEA .) </p><p> The Temple of Belus, which is supposed to occupy its site, is described by the Greek historian Herodotus as a temple of great extent and magnificence, erected by the Babylonians for their god Belus. The treasures Nebuchadnezzar brought from Jerusalem were laid up in this temple ( 2 Chronicles 36:7 ).  </p><p> The Birs Nimrud, at ancient Borsippa, about 7 miles south-west of Hillah, the modern town which occupies a part of the site of ancient Babylon, and 6 miles from the Euphrates, is an immense mass of broken and fire-blasted fragments, of about 2,300 feet in circumference, rising suddenly to the height of 235 feet above the desert-plain, and is with probability regarded as the ruins of the tower of Babel. This is "one of the most imposing ruins in the country." Others think it to be the ruins of the Temple of Belus.  </p>
Babylon	<p>the Greek form of BABEL; Semitic form Babilu, meaning "The Gate of God." In the Assyrian tablets it means "The city of the dispersion of the tribes." The monumental list of its kings reaches back to B.C. 2300, and includes Khammurabi, or Amraphel (q.v.), the contemporary of Abraham. It stood on the Euphrates, about 200 miles above its junction with the Tigris, which flowed through its midst and divided it into two almost equal parts. The Elamites invaded Chaldea (i.e., Lower Mesopotamia, or Shinar, and Upper Mesopotamia, or Accad, now combined into one) and held it in subjection. At length Khammu-rabi delivered it from the foreign yoke, and founded the new empire of Chaldea (q.v.), making Babylon the capital of the united kingdom. This city gradually grew in extent and grandeur, but in process of time it became subject to Assyria. On the fall of Nineveh (B.C. 606) it threw off the Assyrian yoke, and became the capital of the growing Babylonian empire. Under Nebuchadnezzar it became one of the most splendid cities of the ancient world.  </p><p> After passing through various vicissitudes the city was occupied by Cyrus, "king of Elam," B.C. 538, who issued a decree permitting the Jews to return to their own land (Ezra 1). It then ceased to be the capital of an empire. It was again and again visited by hostile armies, till its inhabitants were all driven from their homes, and the city became a complete desolation, its very site being forgotten from among men.  </p><p> On the west bank of the Euphrates, about 50 miles south of Bagdad, there is found a series of artificial mounds of vast extent. These are the ruins of this once famous proud city. These ruins are principally (1) the great mound called Babil by the Arabs. This was probably the noted Temple of Belus, which was a pyramid about 480 feet high. (2) The Kasr (i.e., "the palace"). This was the great palace of Nebuchadnezzar. It is almost a square, each side of which is about 700 feet long. The little town of Hillah, near the site of Babylon, is built almost wholly of bricks taken from this single mound. (3) A lofty mound, on the summit of which stands a modern tomb called Amran ibn-Ali. This is probably the most ancient portion of the remains of the city, and represents the ruins of the famous hanging-gardens, or perhaps of some royal palace. The utter desolation of the city once called "The glory of kingdoms" (Isa.13:19) was foretold by the prophets (Isa.13:4-22;  Jeremiah 25:12 ;  Jeremiah 50:2 Jeremiah 50:3 ;  Daniel 2:31-38 ).  </p><p> The Babylon mentioned in  1 Peter 5:13  was not Rome, as some have thought, but the literal city of Babylon, which was inhabited by many Jews at the time Peter wrote.  </p><p> In  Revelation 14:8 ;  16:19 ;  17:5 ; and  18:2 , "Babylon" is supposed to mean Rome, not considered as pagan, but as the prolongation of the ancient power in the papal form. Rome, pagan and papal, is regarded as one power. "The literal Babylon was the beginner and supporter of tyranny and idolatry...This city and its whole empire were taken by the Persians under Cyrus; the Persians were subdued by the Macedonians, and the Macedonians by the Romans; so that Rome succeeded to the power of old Babylon. And it was her method to adopt the worship of the false deities she had conquered; so that by her own act she became the heiress and successor of all the Babylonian idolatry, and of all that was introduced into it by the immediate successors of Babylon, and consequently of all the idolatry of the earth." Rome, or "mystical Babylon," is "that great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth" ( 17:18 ).  </p>
Babylon, kingdom of	<p>called "the land of the Chaldeans" ( Jeremiah 24:5 ; Ezek,  12:13 ), was an extensive province in Central Asia along the valley of the Tigris from the Persian Gulf northward for some 300 miles. It was famed for its fertility and its riches. Its capital was the city of Babylon, a great commercial centre ( Ezekiel 17:4 ;  Isaiah 43:14 ). Babylonia was divided into the two districts of Accad in the north, and Summer (probably the Shinar of the Old Testament) in the south. Among its chief cities may be mentioned Ur (now Mugheir or Mugayyar), on the western bank of the Euphrates; Uruk, or Erech ( Genesis 10:10 ) (now Warka), between Ur and Babylon; Larsa (now Senkereh), the Ellasar of  Genesis 14:1 , a little to the east of Erech; Nipur (now Niffer), south-east of Babylon; Sepharvaim ( 2 Kings 17:24 ), "the two Sipparas" (now Abu-Habba), considerably to the north of Babylon; and Eridu, "the good city" (now Abu-Shahrein), which lay originally on the shore of the Persian Gulf, but is now, owing to the silting up of the sand, about 100 miles distant from it. Another city was Kulunu, or Calneh ( Genesis 10:10 ).  </p><p> The salt-marshes at the mouths of the Euphrates and Tigris were called Marratu, "the bitter" or "salt", the Merathaim of  Jeremiah 50:21 . They were the original home of the Kalda, or Chaldeans.  </p><p> The most famous of the early kings of Babylonia were Sargon of Accad (B.C.3800) and his son, Naram-Sin, who conquered a large part of Western Asia, establishing their power in Palestine, and even carrying their arms to the Sinaitic peninsula. A great Babylonian library was founded in the reign of Sargon. Babylonia was subsequently again broken up into more than one state, and at one time fell under the domination of Elam. This was put an end to by Khammu-rabi (Amraphel), who drove the Elamites out of the country, and overcame Arioch, the son of an Elamite prince. From this time forward Babylonia was a united monarchy. About B.C. 1750 it was conquered by the Kassi, or Kosseans, from the mountains of Elam, and a Kassite dynasty ruled over it for 576 years and 9 months.  </p><p> In the time of Khammu-rabi, Syria and Palestine were subject to Babylonia and its Elamite suzerain; and after the overthrow of the Elamite supremacy, the Babylonian kings continued to exercise their influence and power in what was called "the land of the Amorites." In the epoch of the Kassite dynasty, however, Canaan passed into the hands of Egypt. </p><p> In B.C. 729, Babylonia was conquered by the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser III.; but on the death of Shalmaneser IV. it was seized by the Kalda or "Chaldean" prince Merodach-baladan ( 2 Kings 20:12-19 ), who held it till B.C. 709, when he was driven out by Sargon.  </p><p> Under Sennacherib, Babylonia revolted from Assyria several times, with the help of the Elamites, and after one of these revolts Babylon was destroyed by Sennacherib, B.C. 689. It was rebuilt by Esarhaddon, who made it his residence during part of the year, and it was to Babylon that Manasseh was brought a prisoner ( 2 Chronicles 33:11 ). After the death of Esarhaddon, Saul-sumyukin, the viceroy of Babylonia, revolted against his brother the Assyrian king, and the revolt was suppressed with difficulty.  </p><p> When Nineveh was destroyed, B.C. 606, Nabopolassar, the viceroy of Babylonia, who seems to have been of Chaldean descent, made himself independent. His son Nebuchadrezzar (Nabu-kudur-uzur), after defeating the Egyptians at Carchemish, succeeded him as king, B.C. 604, and founded the Babylonian empire. He strongly fortified Babylon, and adorned it with palaces and other buildings. His son, Evil-merodach, who succeeded him in B.C. 561, was murdered after a reign of two years. The last monarch of the Babylonian empire was Nabonidus (Nabu-nahid), B.C. 555-538, whose eldest son, Belshazzar (Bilu-sar-uzur), is mentioned in several inscriptions. Babylon was captured by Cyrus, B.C. 538, and though it revolted more than once in later years, it never succeeded in maintaining its independence.  </p>
Babylonish garment	<p>a robe of rich colours fabricated at Babylon, and hence of great value (Josh.7:21).  </p>
Baca, Valley of	<p>( Psalms 84:6 ; RSV, "valley of weeping," marg., "or balsam trees"), probably a valley in some part of Palestine, or generally some one of the valleys through which pilgrims had to pass on their way to the sanctuary of Jehovah on Zion; or it may be figuratively "a valley of weeping."  </p>
Backbite	<p>In  Psalms 15:3 , the rendering of a word which means to run about tattling, calumniating; in  Proverbs 25:23 , secret talebearing or slandering; in  Romans 1:30  and  2 Corinthians 12:20 , evil-speaking, maliciously defaming the absent.  </p>
Backslide	<p>to draw back or apostatize in matters of religion ( Acts 21:21 ;  2 th  2:3 ;  1 Timothy 4:1 ). This may be either partial ( Proverbs 14:14 ) or complete ( Hebrews 6:4-6 ;  Hebrews 10:38 Hebrews 10:39 ). The apostasy may be both doctrinal and moral.  </p>
Badger	<p>this word is found in  Exodus 25:5 ;  26:14 ;  Exodus 35:7 Exodus 35:23 ;  36:19 ;  39:34 ;  Numbers 4:6 , etc. The tabernacle was covered with badgers' skins; the shoes of women were also made of them ( Ezekiel 16:10 ). Our translators seem to have been misled by the similarity in sound of the Hebrew <i> tachash_ and the Latin _taxus</i> , "a badger." The revisers have correctly substituted "seal skins." The Arabs of the Sinaitic peninsula apply the name <i> tucash</i> to the seals and dugongs which are common in the Red Sea, and the skins of which are largely used as leather and for sandals. Though the badger is common in Palestine, and might occur in the wilderness, its small hide would have been useless as a tent covering. The dugong, very plentiful in the shallow waters on the shores of the Red Sea, is a marine animal from 12 to 30 feet long, something between a whale and a seal, never leaving the water, but very easily caught. It grazes on seaweed, and is known by naturalists as Halicore tabernaculi.  </p>
Bag	<p></p><li> A pocket of a cone-like shape in which Naaman bound two pieces of silver for Gehazi ( 2 Kings 5:23 ). The same Hebrew word occurs elsewhere only in  Isaiah 3:22 , where it is rendered "crisping-pins," but denotes the reticules (or as RSV, "satchels") carried by Hebrew women.  </li><li> Another word (kees) so rendered means a bag for carrying weights ( Deuteronomy 25:13 ;  Proverbs 16:11 ;  Micah 6:11 ). It also denotes a purse ( Proverbs 1:14 ) and a cup ( 23:31 ).  </li><li> Another word rendered "bag" in  1 Samuel 17:40  is rendered "sack" in  Genesis 42:25 ; and in  1 Samuel 9:7 ;  21:5  "vessel," or wallet for carrying food.  </li><li> The word rendered in the Authorized Version "bags," in which the priests bound up the money contributed for the restoration of the temple ( 2 Kings 12:10 ), is also rendered "bundle" ( Genesis 42:35 ;  1 Samuel 25:29 ). It denotes bags used by travellers for carrying money during a journey ( Proverbs 7:20 ;  Haggai 1:6 ).  </li><li> The "bag" of Judas was a small box ( John 12:6 ;  13:29 ).   </li>
Bahurim	<p>young men, a place east of Jerusalem ( 2 Samuel 3:16 ;  19:16 ), on the road to the Jordan valley. Here Shimei resided, who poured forth vile abuse against David, and flung dust and stones at him and his party when they were making their way down the eastern slopes of Olivet toward Jordan ( 16:5 ); and here Jonathan and Ahimaaz hid themselves ( 17:18 ).  </p><p> With the exception of Shimei, Azmaveth, one of David's heroes, is the only other native of the place who is mentioned ( 2 Samuel 23:31 ;  1 Chronicles 11:33 ).  </p>
Bajith	<p>house, probably a city of Moab, which had a celebrated idol-temple ( Isaiah 15:2 ). It has also been regarded as denoting simply the temple of the idol of Moab as opposed to the "high place."  </p>
Bake	<p>The duty of preparing bread was usually, in ancient times, committed to the females or the slaves of the family ( Genesis 18:6 ;  Leviticus 26:26 ;  1 Samuel 8:13 ); but at a later period we find a class of public bakers mentioned ( Hosea 7:4 Hosea 7:6 ;  Jeremiah 37:21 ).  </p><p> The bread was generally in the form of long or round cakes ( Exodus 29:23 ;  1 Samuel 2:36 ), of a thinness that rendered them easily broken ( Isaiah 58:7 ;  Matthew 14:19 ;  26:26 ;  Acts 20:11 ). Common ovens were generally used; at other times a jar was half-filled with hot pebbles, and the dough was spread over them. Hence we read of "cakes baken on the coals" ( 1 Kings 19:6 ), and "baken in the oven" ( Leviticus 2:4 ). (See BREAD .) </p>
Bake-meats	<p>baked provisions ( Genesis 40:17 ), literally "works of the baker," such as biscuits and cakes.  </p>
Balaam	<p>lord of the people; foreigner or glutton, as interpreted by others, the son of Beor, was a man of some rank among the Midianites ( Numbers 31:8 ; Compare 16). He resided at Pethor ( Deuteronomy 23:4 ), in Mesopotamia ( Numbers 23:7 ). It is evident that though dwelling among idolaters he had some knowledge of the true God; and was held in such reputation that it was supposed that he whom he blessed was blessed, and he whom he cursed was cursed. When the Israelites were encamped on the plains of Moab, on the east of Jordan, by Jericho, Balak sent for Balaam "from Aram, out of the mountains of the east," to curse them; but by the remarkable interposition of God he was utterly unable to fulfil Balak's wish, however desirous he was to do so. The apostle Peter refers ( 2 Peter 2:15 2 Peter 2:16 ) to this as an historical event. In  Micah 6:5  reference also is made to the relations between Balaam and Balak. Though Balaam could not curse Israel, yet he suggested a mode by which the divine displeasure might be caused to descend upon them ( Numbers 25 ). In a battle between Israel and the Midianites (q.v.) Balaam was slain while fighting on the side of Balak ( Numbers 31:8 ).  </p><p> The "doctrine of Balaam" is spoken of in  Revelation 2:14 , in allusion to the fact that it was through the teaching of Balaam that Balak learned the way by which the Israelites might be led into sin. (See NICOLAITANES .) Balaam was constrained to utter prophecies regarding the future of Israel of wonderful magnificence and beauty of expression ( Numbers 24:5-9 Numbers 24:17 ).  </p>
Baladan	<p>he has given a son, the father of the Babylonian king ( 2 Kings 20:12 ;  Isaiah 39:1 ) Merodach-baladan (q.v.).  </p>
Balah	<p>a city in the tribe of Simeon ( Joshua 19:3 ), elsewhere called Bilhah ( 1 Chronicles 4:29 ) and Baalah ( Joshua 15:29 ).  </p>
Balak	<p>empty; spoiler, a son of Zippor, and king of the Moabites ( Numbers 22:2 Numbers 22:4 ). From fear of the Israelites, who were encamped near the confines of his territory, he applied to Balaam (q.v.) to curse them; but in vain ( Joshua 24:9 ).  </p>
Balance	<p>occurs in  Leviticus 19:36  and  Isaiah 46:6 , as the rendering of the Hebrew <i> kanch'</i> , which properly means "a reed" or "a cane," then a rod or beam of a balance. This same word is translated "measuring reed" in  Ezekiel 40:3 Ezekiel 40:5 ;  42:16-18 . There is another Hebrew word, <i> mozena'yim</i> , i.e., "two poisers", also so rendered ( Daniel 5:27 ). The balances as represented on the most ancient Egyptian monuments resemble those now in use. A "pair of balances" is a symbol of justice and fair dealing ( Job 31:6 ;  Psalms 62:9 ;  Proverbs 11:1 ). The expression denotes great want and scarcity in  Revelation 6:5 .  </p>
Baldness	<p>from natural causes was uncommon ( 2 Kings 2:23 ;  Isaiah 3:24 ). It was included apparently under "scab" and "scurf," which disqualified for the priesthood ( Leviticus 21:20 ). The Egyptians were rarely subject to it. This probably arose from their custom of constantly shaving the head, only allowing the hair to grow as a sign of mourning. With the Jews artificial baldness was a sign of mourning ( Isaiah 22:12 ;  Jeremiah 7:29 ;  16:6 ); it also marked the conclusion of a Nazarite's vow ( Acts 18:18 ;  21:24 ;  Numbers 6:9 ). It is often alluded to ( Micah 1:16 ;  Amos 8:10 ;  Jeremiah 47:5 ). The Jews were forbidden to follow the customs of surrounding nations in making themselves bald ( Deuteronomy 14:1 ).  </p>
Balm	<p>contracted from Bal'sam, a general name for many oily or resinous substances which flow or trickle from certain trees or plants when an incision is made through the bark. </p><li> This word occurs in the Authorized Version ( Genesis 37:25 ;  43:11 ;  Jeremiah 8:22 ;  46:11 ;  51:8 ;  Ezekiel 27:17 ) as the rendering of the Hebrew word <i> tsori_ or _tseri</i> , which denotes the gum of a tree growing in Gilead (q.v.), which is very precious. It was celebrated for its medicinal qualities, and was circulated as an article of merchandise by Arab and Phoenician merchants. The shrub so named was highly valued, and was almost peculiar to Palestine. In the time of Josephus it was cultivated in the neighbourhood of Jericho and the Dead Sea. There is an Arab tradition that the tree yielding this balm was brought by the queen of Sheba as a present to Solomon, and that he planted it in his gardens at Jericho. </li><li> There is another Hebrew word, <i> basam_ or _bosem</i> , from which our word "balsam," as well as the corresponding Greek balsamon, is derived. It is rendered "spice" (Cant  Ezekiel 5:1 Ezekiel 5:13 ;  6:2 ; margin of Revised Version, "balsam;"  Exodus 35:28 ;  1 Kings 10:10 ), and denotes fragrance in general. <i> Basam</i> also denotes the true balsam-plant, a native of South Arabia (Cant. l.c.).  </li>
Bamah	<p>a height, a name used simply to denote a high place where the Jews worshipped idols ( Ezekiel 20:29 ). The plural is translated "high places" in  Numbers 22:41  and  Ezekiel 36:2 .  </p>
Bamoth	<p>heights, the forty-seventh station of the Israelites ( Numbers 21:19 Numbers 21:20 ) in the territory of the Moabites.  </p>
Bamoth-baal	<p>heights of Baal, a place on the river Arnon, or in the plains through which it flows, east of Jordan ( Joshua 13:17 ; Compare  Numbers 21:28 ). It has been supposed to be the same place as Bamoth.  </p>
Bands	<p>(1) of love ( Hosea 11:4 ); (2) of Christ ( Psalms 2:3 ); (3) uniting together Christ's body the church ( Colossians 2:19 ;  3:14 ;  Ephesians 4:3 ); (4) the emblem of the captivity of Israel ( Ezekiel 34:27 ;  Isaiah 28:22 ;  52:2 ); (5) of brotherhood ( Ezekiel 37:15-28 ); (6) no bands to the wicked in their death ( Psalms 73:4 ;  Job 21:7 ;  Psalms 10:6 ). Also denotes chains ( Luke 8:29 ); companies of soldiers ( Acts 21:31 ); a shepherd's staff, indicating the union between Judah and Israel ( Zechariah 11:7 ).  </p>
Bani	<p>built. </p><li> 1 Chronicles 6:46 . </li><li> One of David's thirty-seven warriors, a Gadite ( 2 Samuel 23:36 ). </li><li> Ezra 2:10 ;  Ezra 10:29 Ezra 10:34 Ezra 10:38 . </li><li> A Levite who was prominent in the reforms on the return from Babylon ( Nehemiah 8:7 ;  Nehemiah 9:4 Nehemiah 9:5 ). His son Rehum took part in rebuilding the wall of Jerusalem ( Nehemiah 3:17 ).   </li>
Banner	<p></p><li> The flag or banner of the larger kind, serving for three tribes marching together. These standards, of which there were four, were worked with embroidery and beautifully ornamented ( Numbers 1:52 ;  Numbers 2:2 Numbers 2:3 Numbers 2:10 Numbers 2:18 Numbers 2:25 ; Cant  2:4 ;  Numbers 6:4 Numbers 6:10 ).  </li><li> The flag borne by each separate tribe, of a smaller form. Probably it bore on it the name of the tribe to which it belonged, or some distinguishing device ( Numbers 2:2 Numbers 2:34 ).  </li><li> A lofty signal-flag, not carried about, but stationary. It was usually erected on a mountain or other lofty place. As soon as it was seen the war-trumpets were blown ( Psalms 60:4 ;  Isaiah 5:26 ;  11:12 ;  13:2 ;  18:3 ;  30:17 ;  Jeremiah 4:6 21 ;  Ezekiel 27:7 ).  </li><li> A "sign of fire" ( Jeremiah 6:1 ) was sometimes used as a signal.  <p> The banners and ensigns of the Roman army had idolatrous images upon them, and hence they are called the "abomination of desolation" (q.v.). The principal Roman standard, however, was an eagle. (See   Matthew 24:28 ;  Luke 17:37 , where the Jewish nation is compared to a dead body, which the eagles gather together to devour.)  </p><p> God's setting up or giving a banner ( Psalms 20:5 ;  60:4 ; Cant.  2:4 ) imports his presence and protection and aid extended to his people.  </p> </li>
Banquet	<p>a feast provided for the entertainment of a company of guests ( Esther 5 ;  7 ;  1 Peter 4:3 ); such as was provided for our Lord by his friends in Bethany ( Matthew 26:6 ;  Mark 14:3 ; Compare  John 12:2 ). These meals were in the days of Christ usually called "suppers," after the custom of the Romans, and were partaken of toward the close of the day. It was usual to send a second invitation ( Matthew 22:3 ;  Luke 14:17 ) to those who had been already invited. When the whole company was assembled, the master of the house shut the door with his own hands ( Luke 13:25 ;  Matthew 25:10 ).  </p><p> The guests were first refreshed with water and fragrant oil ( Luke 7:38 ;  Mark 7:4 ). A less frequent custom was that of supplying each guest with a robe to be worn during the feast ( Ecclesiastes 9:8 ;  Revelation 3:4 Revelation 3:5 ;  Matthew 22:11 ). At private banquets the master of the house presided; but on public occasions a "governor of the feast" was chosen ( John 2:8 ). The guests were placed in order according to seniority ( Genesis 43:33 ), or according to the rank they held ( Proverbs 25:6 Proverbs 25:7 ;  Matthew 23:6 ;  Luke 14:7 ).  </p><p> As spoons and knives and forks are a modern invention, and were altogether unknown in the East, the hands alone were necessarily used, and were dipped in the dish, which was common to two of the guests ( John 13:26 ). In the days of our Lord the guests reclined at table; but the ancient Israelites sat around low tables, cross-legged, like the modern Orientals. Guests were specially honoured when extra portions were set before them ( Genesis 43:34 ), and when their cup was filled with wine till it ran over ( Psalms 23:5 ). The hands of the guests were usually cleaned by being rubbed on bread, the crumbs of which fell to the ground, and were the portion for dogs ( Matthew 15:27 ;  Luke 16:21 ).  </p><p> At the time of the three annual festivals at Jerusalem family banquets were common. To these the "widow, and the fatherless, and the stranger" were welcome ( Deuteronomy 16:11 ). Sacrifices also included a banquet ( Exodus 34:15 ;  Judges 16:23 ). Birthday banquets are mentioned ( Genesis 40:20 ;  Matthew 14:6 ). They were sometimes protracted, and attended with revelry and excess ( Genesis 21:8 ;  29:22 ;  1 Samuel 25:2 1 Samuel 25:36 ;  2 Sam  13:23 ). Portions were sometimes sent from the table to poorer friends ( Nehemiah 8:10 ;  Esther 9:19 Esther 9:22 ). (See MEALS .) </p>
Baptism for the dead	<p>only mentioned in  1 Corinthians 15:29 . This expression as used by the apostle may be equivalent to saying, "He who goes through a baptism of blood in order to join a glorified church which has no existence [i.e., if the dead rise not] is a fool." Some also regard the statement here as an allusion to the strange practice which began, it is said, to prevail at Corinth, in which a person was baptized in the stead of others who had died before being baptized, to whom it was hoped some of the benefits of that rite would be extended. This they think may have been one of the erroneous customs which Paul went to Corinth to "set in order."  </p>
Baptism of Christ	<p>Christ had to be formally inaugurated into the public discharge of his offices. For this purpose he came to John, who was the representative of the law and the prophets, that by him he might be introduced into his offices, and thus be publicly recognized as the Messiah of whose coming the prophecies and types had for many ages borne witness. </p><p> John refused at first to confer his baptism on Christ, for he understood not what he had to do with the "baptism of repentance." But Christ said, "'Suffer it to be so now,' NOW as suited to my state of humiliation, my state as a substitute in the room of sinners." His reception of baptism was not necessary on his own account. It was a voluntary act, the same as his act of becoming incarnate. Yet if the work he had engaged to accomplish was to be completed, then it became him to take on him the likeness of a sinner, and to fulfil all righteousness ( Matthew 3:15 ).  </p><p> The official duty of Christ and the sinless person of Christ are to be distinguished. It was in his official capacity that he submitted to baptism. In coming to John our Lord virtually said, "Though sinless, and without any personal taint, yet in my public or official capacity as the Sent of God, I stand in the room of many, and bring with me the sin of the world, for which I am the propitiation." Christ was not made under the law on his own account. It was as surety of his people, a position which he spontaneously assumed. The administration of the rite of baptism was also a symbol of the baptism of suffering before him in this official capacity ( Luke 12:50 ). In thus presenting himself he in effect dedicated or consecrated himself to the work of fulfilling all righteousness.  </p>
Baptism, Christian	<p>an ordinance immediately instituted by Christ ( Matthew 28:19 Matthew 28:20 ), and designed to be observed in the church, like that of the Supper, "till he come." The words "baptize" and "baptism" are simply Greek words transferred into English. This was necessarily done by the translators of the Scriptures, for no literal translation could properly express all that is implied in them.  </p><p> The mode of baptism can in no way be determined from the Greek word rendered "baptize." Baptists say that it means "to dip," and nothing else. That is an incorrect view of the meaning of the word. It means both (1) to dip a thing into an element or liquid, and (2) to put an element or liquid over or on it. Nothing therefore as to the mode of baptism can be concluded from the mere word used. The word has a wide latitude of meaning, not only in the New Testament, but also in the LXX. Version of the Old Testament, where it is used of the ablutions and baptisms required by the Mosaic law. These were effected by immersion, and by affusion and sprinkling; and the same word, "washings" ( Hebrews 9:10 Hebrews 9:13 Hebrews 9:19 Hebrews 9:21 ) or "baptisms," designates them all. In the New Testament there cannot be found a single well-authenticated instance of the occurrence of the word where it necessarily means immersion. Moreover, none of the instances of baptism recorded in the Acts of the Apostles ( 2:38-41 ;  8:26-39 ;  Hebrews 9:17 Hebrews 9:18 ;  22:12-16 ;  10:44-48 ;  16:32-34 ) favours the idea that it was by dipping the person baptized, or by immersion, while in some of them such a mode was highly improbable.  </p><p> The gospel and its ordinances are designed for the whole world, and it cannot be supposed that a form for the administration of baptism would have been prescribed which would in any place (as in a tropical country or in polar regions) or under any circumstances be inapplicable or injurious or impossible. </p><p> Baptism and the Lord's Supper are the two symbolical ordinances of the New Testament. The Supper represents the work of Christ, and Baptism the work of the Spirit. As in the Supper a small amount of bread and wine used in this ordinance exhibits in symbol the great work of Christ, so in Baptism the work of the Holy Spirit is fully seen in the water poured or sprinkled on the person in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. That which is essential in baptism is only "washing with water," no mode being specified and none being necessary or essential to the symbolism of the ordinance. </p><p> The apostles of our Lord were baptized with the Holy Ghost ( Matthew 3:11 ) by his coming upon them ( Acts 1:8 ). The fire also with which they were baptized sat upon them. The extraordinary event of Pentecost was explained by Peter as a fulfilment of the ancient promise that the Spirit would be poured out in the last days ( 2:17 ). He uses also with the same reference the expression shed forth as descriptive of the baptism of the Spirit (33). In the Pentecostal baptism "the apostles were not dipped into the Spirit, nor plunged into the Spirit; but the Spirit was shed forth, poured out, fell on them ( 11:15 ), came upon them, sat on them." That was a real and true baptism. We are warranted from such language to conclude that in like manner when water is poured out, falls, comes upon or rests upon a person when this ordinance is administered, that person is baptized. Baptism is therefore, in view of all these arguments "rightly administered by pouring or sprinkling water upon the person."  </p><p> The subjects of baptism. This raises questions of greater importance than those relating to its mode. </p><p> 1. The controversy here is not about "believers' baptism," for that is common to all parties. Believers were baptized in apostolic times, and they have been baptized in all time by all the branches of the church. It is altogether a misrepresentation to allege, as is sometimes done by Baptists, that their doctrine is "believers' baptism." Every instance of adult baptism, or of "believers' baptism," recorded in the New Testament ( Acts 2:41 ;  8:37 ;  Acts 9:17 Acts 9:18 ;  10:47 ;  16:15 ;  19:5 , etc.) is just such as would be dealt with in precisely the same way by all branches of the Protestant Church, a profession of faith or of their being "believers" would be required from every one of them before baptism. The point in dispute is not the baptism of believers, but whether the infant children of believers, i.e., of members of the church, ought to be baptized.  </p><p> 2. In support of the doctrine of infant baptism, i.e., of the baptism of the infants, or rather the "children," of believing parents, the following considerations may be adduced:  </p><p> The Church of Christ exists as a divinely organized community. It is the "kingdom of God," one historic kingdom under all dispensations. The commonwealth of Israel was the "church" ( Acts 7:38 ;  Romans 9:4 ) under the Mosaic dispensation. The New Testament church is not a new and different church, but one with that of the Old Testament. The terms of admission into the church have always been the same viz., a profession of faith and a promise of subjection to the laws of the kingdom. Now it is a fact beyond dispute that the children of God's people under the old dispensation were recognized as members of the church. Circumcision was the sign and seal of their membership. It was not because of carnal descent from Abraham, but as being the children of God's professing people, that this rite was administered ( Romans 4:11 ). If children were members of the church under the old dispensation, which they undoubtedly were, then they are members of the church now by the same right, unless it can be shown that they have been expressly excluded. Under the Old Testament parents acted for their children and represented them. (See   Genesis 9:9 ;  17:10 ;  Exodus 24:7 Exodus 24:8 ;  Deuteronomy 29:9-13 .) When parents entered into covenant with God, they brought their children with them. This was a law in the Hebrew Church. When a proselyte was received into membership, he could not enter without bringing his children with him. The New Testament does not exclude the children of believers from the church. It does not deprive them of any privilege they enjoyed under the Old Testament. There is no command or statement of any kind, that can be interpreted as giving any countenance to such an idea, anywhere to be found in the New Testament. The church membership of infants has never been set aside. The ancient practice, orginally appointed by God himself, must remain a law of his kingdom till repealed by the same divine authority. There are lambs in the fold of the Good Shepherd ( John 21:15 ; Compare  Luke 1:15 ;  Matthew 19:14 ;  1 Corinthians 7:14 ).  </p><p> "In a company of converts applying for admission into Christ's house there are likely to be some heads of families. How is their case to be treated? How, for example, are Lydia and her neighbour the keeper of the city prison to be treated? Both have been converted. Both are heads of families. They desire to be received into the infant church of Philippi. What is Christ's direction to them? Shall we say that it is to this effect: 'Arise, and wash away your sins, and come into my house. But you must come in by yourselves. These babes in your arms, you must leave them outside. They cannot believe yet, and so they cannot come in. Those other little ones by your side, their hearts may perhaps have been touched with the love of God; still, they are not old enough to make a personal profession, so they too must be left outside...For the present you must leave them where they are and come in by yourselves.' One may reasonably demand very stringent proofs before accepting this as a fair representation of the sort of welcome Christ offers to parents who come to his door bringing their children with them. Surely it is more consonant with all we know about him to suppose that his welcome will be more ample in its scope, and will breathe a more gracious tone. Surely it would be more like the Good Shepherd to say, 'Come in, and bring your little ones along with you. The youngest needs my salvation; and the youngest is accessible to my salvation. You may be unable as yet to deal with them about either sin or salvation, but my gracious power can find its way into their hearts even now. I can impart to them pardon and a new life. From Adam they have inherited sin and death; and I can so unite them to myself that in me they shall be heirs of righteousness and life. You may without misgiving bring them to me. And the law of my house requires that the same day which witnesses your reception into it by baptism must witness their reception also'" (The Church, by Professor Binnie, D.D.). </p>
Baptism, Johns	<p>was not Christian baptism, nor was that which was practised by the disciples previous to our Lord's crucifixion. Till then the New Testament economy did not exist. John's baptism bound its subjects to repentance, and not to the faith of Christ. It was not administered in the name of the Trinity, and those whom John baptized were rebaptized by Paul ( Acts 18:24 ;  19:7 ).  </p>
Barabbas	<p>i.e., son of Abba or of a father, a notorious robber whom Pilate proposed to condemn to death instead of Jesus, whom he wished to release, in accordance with the Roman custom ( John 18:40 ;  Mark 15:7 ;  Luke 23:19 ). But the Jews were so bent on the death of Jesus that they demanded that Barabbas should be pardoned ( Matthew 27:16-26 ;  Acts 3:14 ). This Pilate did.  </p>
Barachel	<p>whom God has blessed, a Buzite, the father of Elihu, one of Job's friends ( Job 32:2 Job 32:6 ).  </p>
Barachias, Berechiah	<p>4 (q.v.), whom Jehovah hath blessed, father of the prophet Zechariah ( Zechariah 1:1 Zechariah 1:7 ;  Matthew 23:35 ).  </p>
Barak	<p>lightning, the son of Abinoam ( Judges 4:6 ). At the summons of Deborah he made war against Jabin. She accompanied him into the battle, and gave the signal for the little army to make the attack; in which the host of Jabin was completely routed. The battle was fought ( Judges 4:16 ) in the plain of Jezreel (q.v.). This deliverance of Israel is commemorated in Judg. 5. Barak's faith is commended ( Hebrews 11:32 ). "The character of Barak, though pious, does not seem to have been heroic. Like Gideon, and in a sense Samson, he is an illustration of the words in  Hebrews 11:34 , 'Out of weakness were made strong.'" (See DEBORAH .) </p>
Barbarian	<p>a Greek word used in the New Testament ( Romans 1:14 ) to denote one of another nation. In  Colossians 3:11 , the word more definitely designates those nations of the Roman empire that did not speak Greek. In  1 Corinthians 14:11 , it simply refers to one speaking a different language. The inhabitants of Malta are so called ( Acts 28:1 Acts 28:2 Acts 28:4 ). They were originally a Carthaginian colony. This word nowhere in Scripture bears the meaning it does in modern times.  </p>
Barber	<p>Found only once, in  Ezekiel 5:1 , where reference is made to the Jewish custom of shaving the head as a sign of mourning. The Nazarites were untouched by the razor from their birth ( Numbers 6:5 ). Compare  Judges 16:19 .  </p>
Barefoot	<p>To go barefoot was a sign of great distress ( Isaiah 20:2 Isaiah 20:3 Isaiah 20:4 ), or of some great calamity having fallen on a person ( 2 Samuel 15:30 ).  </p>
Bariah	<p>fugitive, one of Shemaiah's five sons. Their father is counted along with them in  1 Chronicles 3:22 .  </p>
Bar-jesus	<p>son of Joshua, the patronymic of Elymas the sorcerer ( Acts 13:6 ), who met Paul and Barnabas at Paphos. Elymas is a word of Arabic origin meaning "wise."  </p>
Bar-jona	<p>son of Jonah, the patronymic of Peter ( Matthew 16:17 ;  John 1:42 ), because his father's name was Jonas. (See PETER .) </p>
Barkos	<p>painter, ( Ezra 2:53 ;  Nehemiah 7:55 ). The father of some of the Nethinim.  </p>
Barley	<p>a grain much cultivated in Egypt ( Exodus 9:31 ) and in Palestine ( Leviticus 27:16 ;  Deuteronomy 8:8 ). It was usually the food of horses ( 1 Kings 4:28 ). Barley bread was used by the poorer people (Judg.  7:13 ;  2 Kings  4:42 ). Barley of the first crop was ready for the harvest by the time of the Passover, in the middle of April ( Ruth 1:22 ;  2 Sam  21:9 ). Mention is made of barley-meal ( Numbers 5:15 ). Our Lord fed five thousand with "five barley loaves and two small fishes" ( John 6:9 ).  </p>
Barn	<p>a storehouse ( Deuteronomy 28:8 ;  Job 39:12 ;  Haggai 2:19 ) for grain, which was usually under ground, although also sometimes above ground ( Luke 12:18 ).  </p>
Barnabas	<p>son of consolation, the surname of Joses, a Levite ( Acts 4:36 ). His name stands first on the list of prophets and teachers of the church at Antioch ( 13:1 ). Luke speaks of him as a "good man" ( 11:24 ). He was born of Jewish parents of the tribe of Levi. He was a native of Cyprus, where he had a possession of land ( Acts 4:36 Acts 4:37 ), which he sold. His personal appearance is supposed to have been dignified and commanding ( Acts 14:11 Acts 14:12 ). When Paul returned to Jerusalem after his conversion, Barnabas took him and introduced him to the apostles ( 9:27 ). They had probably been companions as students in the school of Gamaliel.  </p><p> The prosperity of the church at Antioch led the apostles and brethren at Jerusalem to send Barnabas thither to superintend the movement. He found the work so extensive and weighty that he went to Tarsus in search of Saul to assist him. Saul returned with him to Antioch and laboured with him for a whole year ( Acts 11:25 Acts 11:26 ). The two were at the end of this period sent up to Jerusalem with the contributions the church at Antioch had made for the poorer brethren there ( 11:28-30 ). Shortly after they returned, bringing John Mark with them, they were appointed as missionaries to the heathen world, and in this capacity visited Cyprus and some of the principal cities of Asia Minor ( Acts 13:14 ). Returning from this first missionary journey to Antioch, they were again sent up to Jerusalem to consult with the church there regarding the relation of Gentiles to the church ( Acts 15:2 :  Galatians 2:1 ). This matter having been settled, they returned again to Antioch, bringing the decree of the council as the rule by which Gentiles were to be admitted into the church.  </p><p> When about to set forth on a second missionary journey, a dispute arose between Saul and Barnabas as to the propriety of taking John Mark with them again. The dispute ended by Saul and Barnabas taking separate routes. Saul took Silas as his companion, and journeyed through Syria and Cilicia; while Barnabas took his nephew John Mark, and visited Cyprus ( Acts 15:36-41 ). Barnabas is not again mentioned by Luke in the Acts.  </p>
Barrel	<p>a vessel used for keeping flour ( 1 Kings 17:12 1 Kings 17:14 1 Kings 17:16 ). The same word (cad) so rendered is also translated "pitcher," a vessel for carrying water ( Genesis 24:14 ;  Judges 7:16 ).  </p>
Barren	<p>For a woman to be barren was accounted a severe punishment among the Jews ( Genesis 16:2 ;  30:1-23 ;  1 Samuel 1:6 1 Samuel 1:27 ;  Isaiah 47:9 ;  49:21 ;  Luke 1:25 ). Instances of barrenness are noticed ( Genesis 11:30 ;  25:21 ;  29:31 ;  Judges 13:2 Judges 13:3 ;  Luke 1:7 Luke 1:36 ).  </p>
Barsabas	<p>son of Saba, the surname (1) of Joseph, also called Justus ( Acts 1:23 ), some identify him with Barnabas; (2) of Judas, who was a "prophet." Nothing more is known of him than what is mentioned in  Acts 15:32 .  </p>
Bartholomew	<p>son of Tolmai, one of the twelve apostles ( Matthew 10:3 ;  Acts 1:13 ); generally supposed to have been the same as Nathanael. In the synoptic gospels Philip and Bartholomew are always mentioned together, while Nathanael is never mentioned; in the fourth gospel, on the other hand, Philip and Nathanael are similarly mentioned together, but nothing is said of Bartholomew. He was one of the disciples to whom our Lord appeared at the Sea of Tiberias after his resurrection ( John 21:2 ). He was also a witness of the Ascension ( Acts 1:4 Acts 1:12 Acts 1:13 ). He was an "Israelite indeed" ( John 1:47 ).  </p>
Bartimaeus	<p>son of Timaeus, one of the two blind beggars of Jericho ( Mark 10:46 ;  Matthew 20:30 ). His blindness was miraculously cured on the ground of his faith.  </p>
Baruch	<p>used to denote the means by which a door is bolted ( Nehemiah 3:3 ); a rock in the sea ( Jonah 2:6 ); the shore of the sea ( Job 38:10 ); strong fortifications and powerful impediments, etc. ( Isaiah 45:2 ;  Amos 1:5 ); defences of a city ( 1 Kings 4:13 ). A bar for a door was of iron ( Isaiah 45:2 ), brass ( Psalms 107:16 ), or wood ( Nahum 3:13 ).  </p>
Baruch	<p>blessed. </p><li> The secretary of the prophet ( Jeremiah 32:12 ;  36:4 ). He was of the tribe of Judah ( 51:59 ). To him Jeremiah dictated his prophecies regarding the invasion of the Babylonians and the Captivity. These he read to the people from a window in the temple in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim, king of Judah ( Jeremiah 36 ). He afterwards read them before the counsellors of the king at a private interview; and then to the king himself, who, after hearing a part of the roll, cut it with a penknife, and threw it into the fire of his winter parlour, where he was sitting.  <p> During the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, he was the keeper of the deed of purchase Jeremiah had made of the territory of Hanameel ( Jeremiah 32:12 ). Being accused by his enemies of favouring the Chaldeans, he was cast, with Jeremiah, into prison, where he remained till the capture of Jerusalem (B.C. 586). He probably died in Babylon.  </p></li><li> Nehemiah 3:20 ;  10:6 ;  11:5 .   </li>
Barzillai	<p>of iron. </p><li> A Meholathite, the father of Adriel ( 2 Samuel 21:8 ).  </li><li> A Gileadite of Rogelim who was distinguished for his loyalty to David. He liberally provided for the king's followers ( 2 Samuel 17:27 ). David on his death-bed, remembering his kindness, commended Barzillai's children to the care of Solomon ( 1 Kings 2:7 ).  </li><li> A priest who married a daughter of the preceding ( Ezra 2:61 ).   </li>
Bashan	<p>light soil, first mentioned in  Genesis 14:5 , where it is said that Chedorlaomer and his confederates "smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth," where Og the king of Bashan had his residence. At the time of Israel's entrance into the Promised Land, Og came out against them, but was utterly routed ( Numbers 21:33-35 ;  Deuteronomy 3:1-7 ). This country extended from Gilead in the south to Hermon in the north, and from the Jordan on the west to Salcah on the east. Along with the half of Gilead it was given to the half-tribe of Manasseh ( Joshua 13:29-31 ). Golan, one of its cities, became a "city of refuge" ( Joshua 21:27 ). Argob, in Bashan, was one of Solomon's commissariat districts ( 1 Kings 4:13 ). The cities of Bashan were taken by Hazael ( 2 Kings 10:33 ), but were soon after reconquered by Jehoash ( 2 Kings 13:25 ), who overcame the Syrians in three battles, according to the word of Elisha (19). From this time Bashan almost disappears from history, although we read of the wild cattle of its rich pastures ( Ezekiel 39:18 ;  Psalms 22:12 ), the oaks of its forests ( Isaiah 2:13 ;  Ezekiel 27:6 ;  Zechariah 11:2 ), and the beauty of its extensive plains ( Amos 4:1 ;  Jeremiah 50:19 ). Soon after the conquest, the name "Gilead" was given to the whole country beyond Jordan. After the Exile, Bashan was divided into four districts, </p><li> Gaulonitis, or Jaulan, the most western; </li><li> Auranitis, the Hauran (Ezek.  <span class="badLink">47:16</span> ); </li><li> Argob or Trachonitis, now the Lejah; and </li><li> Batanaea, now Ard-el-Bathanyeh, on the east of the Lejah, with many deserted towns almost as perfect as when they were inhabited. (See HAURAN .)  </li>
Bashan, Hill of	<p>( Psalms 68:15 ), probably another name for Hermon, which lies to the north of Bashan.  </p>
Bashan-havoth-jair	<p>the Bashan of the villages of Jair, the general name given to Argob by Jair, the son of Manasseh ( Deuteronomy 3:14 ), containing sixty cities with walls and brazen gates ( Joshua 13:30 ;  1 Kings 4:13 ). (See ARGOB .) </p>
Bashemath	<p>sweet-smelling. </p><li> The daughter of Ishmael, the last of Esau's three wives ( Genesis 36:3 Genesis 36:4 Genesis 36:13 ), from whose son Reuel four tribes of the Edomites sprung. She is also called Mahalath ( Genesis 28:9 ). It is noticeable that Esau's three wives receive different names in the genealogical table of the Edomites ( Genesis 36 ) from those given to them in the history ( Genesis 26:34 ;  28:9 ).  </li><li> A daughter of Solomon, and wife of Ahimaaz, one of his officers ( 1 Kings 4:15 ).   </li>
Basilisk	<p>(in RSV,  Isaiah 11:8 ;  14:29 ;  59:5 ;  Jeremiah 8:17 ), the "king serpent," as the name imports; a fabulous serpent said to be three spans long, with a spot on its head like a crown. Probably the yellow snake is intended. (See COCKATRICE .) </p>
Basin	<p>or Bason. </p><li> A trough or laver (Heb. aggan') for washing ( Exodus 24:6 ); rendered also "goblet" (Cant  7:2 ) and "cups" ( Isaiah 22:24 ).  </li><li> A covered dish or urn (Heb. k'for) among the vessels of the temple ( 1 Chronicles 28:17 ;  Ezra 1:10 ;  8:27 ).  </li><li> A vase (Heb. mizrak) from which to sprinkle anything. A metallic vessel; sometimes rendered "bowl" ( Amos 6:6 ;  Zechariah 9:15 ). The vessels of the tabernacle were of brass ( Exodus 27:3 ), while those of the temple were of gold ( 2 Chronicles 4:8 ).  </li><li> A utensil (Heb. saph) for holding the blood of the victims ( Exodus 12:22 ); also a basin for domestic purposes ( 2 Samuel 17:28 ).  <p> The various vessels spoken of by the names "basin, bowl, charger, cup, and dish," cannot now be accurately distinguished. </p><p> The basin in which our Lord washed the disciples' feet ( John 13:5 ) must have been larger and deeper than the hand-basin.  </p> </li>
Basket	<p>There are five different Hebrew words so rendered in the Authorized Version: </p><li> A basket (Heb. sal, a twig or osier) for holding bread ( Genesis 40:16 ;  Exodus 29:3 Exodus 29:23 ;  Leviticus 8:2 Leviticus 8:26 Leviticus 8:31 ;  Numbers 6:15 Numbers 6:17 Numbers 6:19 ). Sometimes baskets were made of twigs peeled; their manufacture was a recognized trade among the Hebrews.  </li><li> That used (Heb. salsilloth') in gathering grapes ( Jeremiah 6:9 ).  </li><li> That in which the first fruits of the harvest were presented, Heb. tene, ( Deuteronomy 26:2 Deuteronomy 26:4 ). It was also used for household purposes. In form it tapered downwards like that called <i> corbis</i> by the Romans. </li><li> A basket (Heb. kelub) having a lid, resembling a bird-cage. It was made of leaves or rushes. The name is also applied to fruit-baskets ( Amos 8:1 Amos 8:2 ).  </li><li> A basket (Heb. dud) for carrying figs ( Jeremiah 24:2 ), also clay to the brick-yard (RSV,  Psalms 81:6 ), and bulky articles ( 2 Kings 10:7 ). This word is also rendered in the Authorized Version "kettle" ( 1 Samuel 2:14 ), "caldron" ( 2 Chronicles 35:13 ), "seething-pot" ( Job 41:20 ).  <p> In the New Testament mention is made of the basket (Gr. kophinos, small "wicker-basket") for the "fragments" in the miracle recorded  Mark 6:43 , and in that recorded  Matthew 15:37  (Gr. spuris, large "rope-basket"); also of the basket in which Paul escaped ( Acts 9:25 , Gr. spuris;  2 Corinthians 11: :  33 , Gr. sargane, "basket of plaited cords").  </p> </li>
Bastard	<p>In the Old Testament the rendering of the Hebrew word <i> mamzer'</i> , which means "polluted." In  Deuteronomy 23:2 , it occurs in the ordinary sense of illegitimate offspring. In  Zechariah 9:6 , the word is used in the sense of foreigner. From the history of Jephthah we learn that there were bastard offspring among the Jews ( Judges 11:1-7 ). In  Hebrews 12:8 , the word (Gr. nothoi) is used in its ordinary sense, and denotes those who do not share the privileges of God's children.  </p>
Bastinado	<p>beating, a mode of punishment common in the East. It is referred to by "the rod of correction" ( Proverbs 22:15 ), "scourging" ( Leviticus 19:20 ), "chastising" ( Deuteronomy 22:18 ). The number of blows could not exceed forty ( Deuteronomy 25:2 Deuteronomy 25:3 ).  </p>
Bat	<p>The Hebrew word (atalleph') so rendered ( Leviticus 11:19 ;  Deuteronomy 14:18 ) implies "flying in the dark." The bat is reckoned among the birds in the list of unclean animals. To cast idols to the "moles and to the bats" means to carry them into dark caverns or desolate places to which these animals resort ( Isaiah 2:20 ), i.e., to consign them to desolation or ruin.  </p>
Bath	<p>a Hebrew liquid measure, the tenth part of an homer ( 1 Kings 7:26 1 Kings 7:38 ;  Ezekiel 45:10 Ezekiel 45:14 ). It contained 8 gallons 3 quarts of our measure. "Ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath" ( Isaiah 5:10 ) denotes great unproductiveness.  </p>
Bath-rabbim	<p>daughter of many, the name of one of the gates of the city of Heshbon, near which were pools (Cant.7:4).  </p>
Baths	<p>The use of the bath was very frequent among the Hebrews ( Leviticus 14:8 ;  Numbers 19:19 , ect.). The high priest at his inauguration ( Leviticus 8:6 ), and on the day of atonement, was required to bathe himself ( Leviticus 16:4 Leviticus 16:24 ). The "pools" mentioned in Neh  Nehemiah 20:20 ,  Isaiah 22:11 ,  John 9:7 , were public bathing-places.  </p>
Bath-sheba	<p>daughter of the oath, or of seven, called also Bath-shu'a ( 1 Chronicles 3:5 ), was the daughter of Eliam ( 2 Samuel 11:3 ) or Ammiel ( 1 Chronicles 3:5 ), and wife of Uriah the Hittite. David committed adultery with her ( 2 Samuel 11:4 2 Samuel 11:5 ;  Psalms 51:1 ). The child born in adultery died ( 2 Samuel 12:15-19 ). After her husband was slain ( 11:15 ) she was married to David ( 11:27 ), and became the mother of ( Solomon 12:24 ;  1 Kings 1:11 ;  2:13 ). She took a prominent part in securing the succession of Solomon to the throne ( 1 Kings 1:11 1 Kings 1:16-21 ).  </p>
Battering-ram	<p>( Ezekiel 4:2 ;  21:22 ), a military engine, consisting of a long beam of wood hung upon a frame, for making breaches in walls. The end of it which was brought against the wall was shaped like a ram's head.  </p>
Battle-axe	<p>a mallet or heavy war-club. Applied metaphorically ( Jeremiah 51:20 ) to Cyrus, God's instrument in destroying Babylon.  </p>
Battle-bow	<p>the war-bow used in fighting ( Zechariah 9:10 ;  10:4 ). "Thy bow was made quite naked" ( Habakkuk 3:9 ) means that it was made ready for use. By David's order ( 2 Samuel 1:18 ) the young men were taught the use, or rather the song of the bow. (See ARMOUR,  BOW .) </p>
Battlement	<p>a parapet wall or balustrade surrounding the flat roofs of the houses, required to be built by a special law ( Deuteronomy 22:8 ). In  Jeremiah 5:10 , it denotes the parapet of a city wall.  </p>
Bay	<p>denotes the estuary of the Dead Sea at the mouth of the Jordan ( Joshua 15:5 ;  18:19 ), also the southern extremity of the same sea ( 15:2 ). The same Hebrew word is rendered "tongue" in  Isaiah 11:15 , where it is used with reference to the forked mouths of the Nile.  </p><p> Bay in Zech 6:3,7denotes the colour of horses, but the original Hebrew means strong, and is here used rather to describe the horses as fleet or spirited.  </p>
Bay tree	<p>named only in  Psalms 37:35 , Authorized Version. The Hebrew word so rendered is <i> ereh</i> , which simply means "native born", i.e., a tree not transplanted, but growing on its native soil, and therefore luxuriantly. If the psalmist intended by this word to denote any particular tree, it may have been the evergreen bay laurel (Laurus nobilis), which is a native of Palestine. Instead of "like a green bay tree" in the Authorized Version, the Revised Version has, "like a green tree in its native soil." </p>
Bdellium	<p>occurs only in  Genesis 2:12 , where it designates a product of the land of Havilah; and in  Numbers 11:7 , where the manna is likened to it in colour. It was probably an aromatic gum like balsam which exuded from a particular tree (Borassus flabelliformis) still found in Arabia, Media, and India. It bears a resemblance in colour to myrrh. Others think the word denotes "pearls," or some precious stone.  </p>
Beacon	<p>a pole (Heb. to'ren) used as a standard or ensign set on the tops of mountains as a call to the people to assemble themselves for some great national purpose ( Isaiah 30:17 ). In  Isaiah 33:23  and  Ezekiel 27:5 , the same word is rendered "mast." (See Banner .) </p>
Bealiah	<p>whose Lord is Jehovah, a Benjamite, one of David's thirty heroes of the sling and bow ( 1 Chronicles 12:5 ).  </p>
Bealoth	<p>citizens, a town in the extreme south of Judah ( Joshua 15:24 ); probably the same as Baalath-beer ( 19:8 ). In  1 Kings 4:16 , the Authorized Version has "in Aloth," the Revised Version "Bealoth."  </p>
Beam	<p>occurs in the Authorized Version as the rendering of various Hebrew words. In  1 Samuel 17:7 , it means a weaver's frame or principal beam; in  Habakkuk 2:11 , a crossbeam or girder;  2 Kings 6:2 2 Kings 6:5 , a cross-piece or rafter of a house;  1 Kings 7:6 , an architectural ornament as a projecting step or moulding; Ezek.  41:25 , a thick plank. In the New Testament the word occurs only in  Matthew 7:3 Matthew 7:4 Matthew 7:5 , and  Luke 6:41 Luke 6:42 , where it means (Gr. dokos) a large piece of wood used for building purposes, as contrasted with "mote" (Gr. karphos), a small piece or mere splinter. "Mote" and "beam" became proverbial for little and great faults.  </p>
Beans	<p>mentioned in  2 Samuel 17:28  as having been brought to David when flying from Absalom. They formed a constituent in the bread ( Ezekiel 4:9 ) was commanded to make, as they were in general much used as an article of diet. They are extensively cultivated in Egypt and Arabia and Syria.  </p>
Bear	<p>a native of the mountain regions of Western Asia, frequently mentioned in Scripture. David defended his flocks against the attacks of a bear ( 1 Samuel 17:34-37 ). Bears came out of the wood and destroyed the children who mocked the prophet Elisha ( 2 Kings 2:24 ). Their habits are referred to in  Isaiah 59:11 ;  Proverbs 28:15 ;  Lamentations 3:10 . The fury of the female bear when robbed of her young is spoken of ( 2 Samuel 17:8 ;  Proverbs 17:12 ;  Hosea 13:8 ). In Daniel's vision of the four great monarchies, the Medo-Persian empire is represented by a bear ( 7:5 ).  </p>
Beard	<p>The mode of wearing it was definitely prescribed to the Jews ( Leviticus 19:27 ;  21:5 ). Hence the import of Ezekiel's ( 5:1-4 ) description of the "razor" i.e., the agents of an angry providence being used against the guilty nation of the Jews. It was a part of a Jew's daily toilet to anoint his beard with oil and perfume ( Psalms 133:2 ). Beards were trimmed with the most fastidious care ( 2 Samuel 19:24 ), and their neglet was an indication of deep sorrow ( Isaiah 15:2 ;  Jeremiah 41:5 ). The custom was to shave or pluck off the hair as a sign of mourning ( Isaiah 50:6 ;  Jeremiah 48:37 ;  Ezra 9:3 ). The beards of David's ambassadors were cut off by hanun ( 2 Samuel 10:4 ) as a mark of indignity.  </p><p> On the other hand, the Egyptians carefully shaved the hair off their faces, and they compelled their slaves to do so also ( Genesis 41:14 ).  </p>
Beast	<p>This word is used of flocks or herds of grazing animals ( Exodus 22:5 ;  Numbers 20:4 Numbers 20:8 Numbers 20:11 ;  Psalms 78:48 ); of beasts of burden ( Genesis 45:17 ); of eatable beasts ( Proverbs 9:2 ); and of swift beasts or dromedaries ( Isaiah 60:6 ). In the New Testament it is used of a domestic animal as property ( Revelation 18:13 ); as used for food ( 1 Corinthians 15:39 ), for service ( Luke 10:34 ;  Acts 23:24 ), and for sacrifice ( Acts 7:42 ).  </p><p> When used in contradistinction to man ( Psalms 36:6 ), it denotes a brute creature generally, and when in contradistinction to creeping things ( Leviticus 11:2-7 ;  27:26 ), a four-footed animal.  </p><p> The Mosaic law required that beasts of labour should have rest on the Sabbath ( Exodus 20:10 ;  23:12 ), and in the Sabbatical year all cattle were allowed to roam about freely, and eat whatever grew in the fields ( Exodus 23:11 ;  Leviticus 25:7 ). No animal could be castrated ( Leviticus 22:24 ). Animals of different kinds were to be always kept separate ( Leviticus 19:19 ;  Deuteronomy 22:10 ). Oxen when used in threshing were not to be prevented from eating what was within their reach ( Deuteronomy 25:4 ; 1co.9:9).  </p><p> This word is used figuratively of an infuriated multitude ( 1 Corinthians 15:32 ;  Acts 19:29 ; Compare  Psalms 22:12 Psalms 22:16 ; Eccl  <span class="badLink">3:18</span> ;  Isaiah 11:6-8 ), and of wicked men ( 2 Peter 2:12 ). The four beasts of Daniel 7:3,17,23represent four kingdoms or kings.  </p>
Beaten gold	<p>in  Numbers 8:4 , means "turned" or rounded work in gold. The Greek Version, however, renders the word "solid gold;" the Revised Version, "beaten work of gold." In  1 Kings 10:16 1 Kings 10:17 , it probably means "mixed" gold, as the word ought to be rendered, i.e., not pure gold. Others render the word in these places "thin plates of gold."  </p>
Beaten oil	<p>( Exodus 27:20 ;  29:40 ), obtained by pounding olives in a mortar, not by crushing them in a mill. It was reckoned the best. (See OLIVE .) </p>
Beautiful gate	<p>the name of one of the gates of the temple ( Acts 3:2 ). It is supposed to have been the door which led from the court of the Gentiles to the court of the women. It was of massive structure, and covered with plates of Corinthian brass.  </p>
Becher	<p>first-born; a youth, the second son of Benjamin ( Genesis 46:21 ), who came down to Egypt with Jacob. It is probable that he married an Ephraimitish heiress, and that his descendants were consequently reckoned among the tribe of Ephraim ( Numbers 26:35 ;  1 Chronicles 7:20 1 Chronicles 7:21 ). They are not reckoned among the descendants of Benjamin ( Numbers 26:38 ).  </p>
Bed	<p>(Heb. mittah), for rest at night ( Exodus 8:3 ;  1 Samuel 19:13 1 Samuel 19:15 1 Samuel 19:16 , etc.); during sickness ( Genesis 47:31 ;  48:2 ;  49:33 , etc.); as a sofa for rest ( 1 Samuel 28:23 ;  Amos 3:12 ). Another Hebrew word (er'es) so rendered denotes a canopied bed, or a bed with curtains ( Deuteronomy 3:11 ;  Psalms 132:3 ), for sickness ( Psalms 6:6 ;  41:3 ).  </p><p> In the New Testament it denotes sometimes a litter with a coverlet ( Matthew 9:2 Matthew 9:6 ;  Luke 5:18 ;  Acts 5:15 ).  </p><p> The Jewish bedstead was frequently merely the divan or platform along the sides of the house, sometimes a very slight portable frame, sometimes only a mat or one or more quilts. The only material for bed-clothes is mentioned in  1 Samuel 19:13 . Sleeping in the open air was not uncommon, the sleeper wrapping himself in his outer garment ( Exodus 22:26 Exodus 22:27 ;  Deuteronomy 24:12 Deuteronomy 24:13 ).  </p>
Bedan	<p>one of the judges of Israel ( 1 Samuel 12:11 ). It is uncertain who he was. Some suppose that Barak is meant, others Samson, but most probably this is a contracted form of Abdon ( Judges 12:13 ).  </p>
Bed-chamber	<p>an apartment in Eastern houses, furnished with a slightly elevated platform at the upper end and sometimes along the sides, on which were laid mattresses. This was the general arrangement of the public sleeping-room for the males of the family and for guests, but there were usually besides distinct bed-chambers of a more private character ( 2 Kings 4:10 ;  Exodus 8:3 ;  2 Kings  6:12 ). In  2 Kings 11:2  this word denotes, as in the margin of the Revised Version, a store-room in which mattresses were kept.  </p>
Bedstead	<p>used in  Deuteronomy 3:11 , but elsewhere rendered "couch," "bed." In  2 Kings 1:4 ;  16:2 ;  Psalms 132:3 ;  Amos 3:12 , the divan is meant by this word.  </p>
Bee	<p>First mentioned in  Deuteronomy 1:44 . Swarms of bees, and the danger of their attacks, are mentioned in  Psalms 118:12 . Samson found a "swarm of bees" in the carcass of a lion he had slain (Judg.  14:8 ). Wild bees are described as laying up honey in woods and in clefts of rocks ( Deuteronomy 32:13 ;  Psalms 81:16 ). In  Isaiah 7:18  the "fly" and the "bee" are personifications of the Egyptians and Assyrians, the inveterate enemies of Israel.  </p>
Beelzebub	<p>(Gr. form Beel'zebul), the name given to Satan, and found only in the New Testament ( Matthew 10:25 ;  Matthew 12:24 Matthew 12:27 ;  Mark 3:22 ). It is probably the same as Baalzebub (q.v.), the god of Ekron, meaning "the lord of flies," or, as others think, "the lord of dung," or "the dung-god."  </p>
Beer	<p>well. </p><li> A place where a well was dug by the direction of Moses, at the forty-fourth station of the Hebrews in their wanderings ( Numbers 21:16-18 ) in the wilderness of Moab. (See WELL .) </li><li> A town in the tribe of Judah to which Jotham fled for fear of Abimelech ( Judges 9:21 ). Some have identified this place with Beeroth.   </li>
Beer-elim	<p>well of heroes, probably the name given to Beer, the place where the chiefs of Israel dug a well ( Numbers 21:16 ;  Isaiah 15:8 ).  </p>
Beeri	<p>illustrious, or the well-man. </p><li> The father of Judith, one of the wives of Esau ( Genesis 26:34 ), the same as Adah ( Genesis 36:2 ). </li><li> The father of the prophet ( Hosea 1:1 ).   </li>
Beer-lahai-roi	<p>i.e., "the well of him that liveth and seeth me," or, as some render it, "the well of the vision of life", the well where the Lord met with Hagar ( Genesis 16:7-14 ). Isaac dwelt beside this well ( 24:62 ;  25:11 ). It has been identified with 'Ain Muweileh, or Moilahhi, south-west of Beersheba, and about 12 miles W. from Kadesh-barnea.  </p>
Beeroth	<p>wells, one of the four cities of the Hivites which entered by fraud into a league with Joshua. It belonged to Benjamin ( Joshua 18:25 ). It has by some been identified with el-Bireh on the way to Nablus, 10 miles north of Jerusalem.  </p>
Beeroth of the children of Jaakan	<p>( Deuteronomy 10:6 ). The same as Bene-jaakan ( Numbers 33:31 ).  </p>
Beersheba	<p>well of the oath, or well of seven, a well dug by Abraham, and so named because he and Abimelech here entered into a compact ( Genesis 21:31 ). On re-opening it, Isaac gave it the same name ( Genesis 26:31-33 ). It was a favourite place of abode of both of these patriarchs ( Genesis 21:33-22:1 Genesis 21:19 ;  26:33 ;  28:10 ). It is mentioned among the "cities" given to the tribe of Simeon ( Joshua 19:2 ;  1 Chronicles 4:28 ). From Dan to Beersheba, a distance of about 144 miles ( Judges 20:1 ;  1 Chronicles 21:2 ;  2 Sam  24:2 ), became the usual way of designating the whole Promised Land, and passed into a proverb. After the return from the Captivity the phrase is narrowed into "from Beersheba unto the valley of Hinnom" ( Nehemiah 11:30 ). The kingdom of the ten tribes extended from Beersheba to Mount Ephraim ( 2 Chronicles 19:4 ). The name is not found in the New Testament. It is still called by the Arabs Bir es-Seba, i.e., "well of the seven", where there are to the present day two principal wells and five smaller ones. It is nearly midway between the southern end of the Dead Sea and the Mediterranean.  </p>
Beetle	<p>(Heb. hargol, meaning "leaper"). Mention of it is made only in  Leviticus 11:22 , where it is obvious the word cannot mean properly the beetle. It denotes some winged creeper with at least four feet, "which has legs above its feet, to leap withal." The description plainly points to the locust (q.v.). This has been an article of food from the earliest times in the East to the present day. The word is rendered "cricket" in the Revised Version.  </p>
Beeves	<p>(an old English plural of the word beef), a name applicable to all ruminating animals except camels, and especially to the Bovidce, or horned cattle ( Leviticus 22:19 Leviticus 22:21 ;  Numbers 31:28 Numbers 31:30 Numbers 31:33 Numbers 31:38 Numbers 31:44 ).  </p>
Beg	<p>That the poor existed among the Hebrews we have abundant evidence ( Exodus 23:11 ;  Deuteronomy 15:11 ), but there is no mention of beggars properly so called in the Old Testament. The poor were provided for by the law of Moses ( Leviticus 19:10 ;  Deuteronomy 12:12 ;  14:29 ). It is predicted of the seed of the wicked that they shall be beggars ( Psalms 37:25 ;  109:10 ).  </p><p> In the New Testament we find not seldom mention made of beggars ( Mark 10:46 ;  Luke 16:20 Luke 16:21 ;  Acts 3:2 ), yet there is no mention of such a class as vagrant beggars, so numerous in the East. "Beggarly," in  Galatians 4:9 , means worthless.  </p>
Behead	<p>a method of taking away life practised among the Egyptians ( Genesis 40:17-19 ). There are instances of this mode of punishment also among the Hebrews ( 2 Samuel 4:8 ;  2 Samuel 20:21 2 Samuel 20:22 ;  2 Kings  10:6-8 ). It is also mentioned in the New Testament ( Matthew 14:8-12 ;  Acts 12:2 ).  </p>
Behemoth	<p>( Job 40:15-24 ). Some have supposed this to be an Egyptian word meaning a "water-ox." The Revised Version has here in the margin "hippopotamus," which is probably the correct rendering of the word. The word occurs frequently in Scripture, but, except here, always as a common name, and translated "beast" or "cattle."  </p>
Bekah	<p>Both the name and its explanation, "a half shekel," are given in  Exodus 38:26 . The word properly means a "division," a "part." (RSV, "beka.")  </p>
Bel	<p>the Aramaic form of Baal, the national god of the Babylonians ( Isaiah 46:1 ;  Jeremiah 50:2 ;  51:44 ). It signifies "lord." (See BAAL .) </p>
Bela	<p>a thing swallowed. </p><li> A city on the shore of the Dead Sea, not far from Sodom, called also Zoar. It was the only one of the five cities that was spared at Lot's intercession ( Genesis 19:20 Genesis 19:23 ). It is first mentioned in  Genesis 14:2 Genesis 14:8 .  </li><li> The eldest son of Benjamin ( Numbers 26:38 ; "Belah,"  Genesis 46:21 ).  </li><li> The son of Beor, and a king of Edom ( Genesis 36:32 Genesis 36:33 ;  1 Chronicles 1:43 ).  </li><li> A son of Azaz ( 1 Chronicles 5:8 ).   </li>
Belial	<p>worthlessness, frequently used in the Old Testament as a proper name. It is first used in  Deuteronomy 13:13 . In the New Testament it is found only in  2 Corinthians 6:15 , where it is used as a name of Satan, the personification of all that is evil. It is translated "wicked" in  Deuteronomy 15:9 ;  Psalms 41:8  (RSV marg.);  101:3 ;  Proverbs 6:12 , etc. The expression "son" or "man of Belial" means simply a worthless, lawless person ( Judges 19:22 ;  20:13 ;  1 Samuel 1:16 ;  2:12 ).  </p>
Bell	<p>The bells first mentioned in Scripture are the small golden bells attached to the hem of the high priest's ephod ( Exodus 28:33 Exodus 28:34 Exodus 28:35 ). The "bells of the horses" mentioned by ( Zechariah 14:20 ) were attached to the bridles or belts round the necks of horses trained for war, so as to accustom them to noise and tumult.  </p>
Bellows	<p>occurs only in  Jeremiah 6:29 , in relation to the casting of metal. Probably they consisted of leather bags similar to those common in Egypt.  </p>
Belly	<p>the seat of the carnal affections ( Titus 1:12 ; Phil  3:19 ;  Romans 16:18 ). The word is used symbolically for the heart ( Proverbs 18:8 ;  20:27 ;  22:18 , marg.). The "belly of hell" signifies the grave or underworld ( Jonah 2:2 ).  </p>
Belshazzar	<p>Bel protect the king!, the last of the kings of Babylon ( Daniel 5:1 ). He was the son of Nabonidus by Nitocris, who was the daughter of Nebuchadnezzar and the widow of Nergal-sharezer. When still young he made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and when heated with wine sent for the sacred vessels his "father" ( Daniel 5:2 ), or grandfather, Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from the temple in Jerusalem, and he and his princes drank out of them. In the midst of their mad revelry a hand was seen by the king tracing on the wall the announcement of God's judgment, which that night fell upon him. At the instance of the queen (i.e., his mother) Daniel was brought in, and he interpreted the writing. That night the kingdom of the Chaldeans came to an end, and the king was slain ( Daniel 5:30 ). (See NERGAL-SHAREZER.)  </p><p> The absence of the name of Belshazzar on the monuments was long regarded as an argument against the genuineness of the Book of Daniel. In 1854 Sir Henry Rawlinson found an inscription of Nabonidus which referred to his eldest son. Quite recently, however, the side of a ravine undermined by heavy rains fell at Hillah, a suburb of Babylon. A number of huge, coarse earthenware vases were laid bare. These were filled with tablets, the receipts and contracts of a firm of Babylonian bankers, which showed that Belshazzar had a household, with secretaries and stewards. One was dated in the third year of the king Marduk-sar-uzur. As Marduk-sar-uzar was another name for Baal, this Marduk-sar-uzur was found to be the Belshazzar of Scripture. In one of these contract tablets, dated in the July after the defeat of the army of Nabonidus, we find him paying tithes for his sister to the temple of the sun-god at Sippara.  </p>
Belteshazzar	<p>Beltis protect the king!, the Chaldee name given to Daniel by Nebuchadnezzar ( Daniel 1:7 ).  </p>
Benaiah	<p>built up by Jehovah. </p><li> The son of Jehoiada, chief priest ( 1 Chronicles 27:5 ). He was set by David over his body-guard of Cherethites and Pelethites ( 2 Samuel 8:18 ;  1 Kings 1:32 ;  1 Chronicles 18:17 ). His exploits are enumerated in  2 Samuel 23:20 2 Samuel 23:21 2 Samuel 23:22 ;  1 Chronicles 11:22 . He remained faithful to Solomon ( 1 Kings 1:8 1 Kings 1:10 1 Kings 1:26 ), by whom he was raised to the rank of commander-in-chief ( 1 Kings 2:25 1 Kings 2:29 1 Kings 2:30 1 Kings 2:34 1 Kings 2:35 ;  4:4 ).  </li><li> 2 Samuel 23:30 ;  1 Chronicles 11:31 .  </li><li> A musical Levite ( 1 Chronicles 15:18 1 Chronicles 15:20 ).  </li><li> A priest ( 1 Chronicles 15:24 ;  16:6 ).  </li><li> The son of Jeiel ( 2 Chronicles 20:14 ).   </li>
Ben-ammi	<p>son of my kindred; i.e., "born of incest", the son of Lot by his youngest daughter ( Genesis 19:38 ).  </p>
Bench	<p>deck of a Tyrian ship, described by ( Ezekiel 27:6 ) as overlaid with box-wood.  </p>
Bene-jaakan	<p>children of Jaakan ( Numbers 33:31 Numbers 33:32 ), the same as Beeroth.  </p>
Ben-hadad	<p>the standing title of the Syrian kings, meaning "the son of Hadad." (See HADADEZER .) </p><li> The king of Syria whom Asa, king of Judah, employed to invade Israel ( 1 Kings 15:18 ).  </li><li> Son of the preceding, also king of Syria. He was long engaged in war against Israel. He was murdered probably by Hazael, by whom he was succeeded ( 2 Kings 8:7-15 ), after a reign of some thirty years.  </li><li> King of Damascus, and successor of his father Hazael on the throne of Syria ( 2 Kings 13:3 2 Kings 13:4 ). His misfortunes in war are noticed by ( Amos 1:4 ).   </li>
Benjamin	<p>son of my right hand. </p><li> The younger son of Jacob by Rachel ( Genesis 35:18 ). His birth took place at Ephrath, on the road between Bethel and Bethlehem, at a short distance from the latter place. His mother died in giving him birth, and with her last breath named him Ben-oni, son of my pain, a name which was changed by his father into Benjamin. His posterity are called Benjamites ( Genesis 49:27 ;  Deuteronomy 33:12 ;  Joshua 18:21 ).  <p> The tribe of Benjamin at the Exodus was the smallest but one ( Numbers 1:36 Numbers 1:37 ;  Psalms 68:27 ). During the march its place was along with Manasseh and Ephraim on the west of the tabernacle. At the entrance into Canaan it counted 45,600 warriors. It has been inferred by some from the words of Jacob ( Genesis 49:27 ) that the figure of a wolf was on the tribal standard. This tribe is mentioned in  Romans 11:1 ; Phil  3:5 .  </p><p> The inheritance of this tribe lay immediately to the south of that of Ephraim, and was about 26 miles in length and 12 in breadth. Its eastern boundary was the Jordan. Dan intervened between it and the Philistines. Its chief towns are named in  Joshua 18:21-28 .  </p><p> The history of the tribe contains a sad record of a desolating civil war in which they were engaged with the other eleven tribes. By it they were almost exterminated ( Judges 20:20 Judges 20:21 ;  21:10 ). (See GIBEAH .) </p><p> The first king of the Jews was Saul, a Benjamite. A close alliance was formed between this tribe and that of Judah in the time of David ( 2 Samuel 19:16 2 Samuel 19:17 ), which continued after his death ( 1 Kings 11:13 ;  12:20 ). After the Exile these two tribes formed the great body of the Jewish nation ( Ezra 1:5 ;  10:9 ).  </p><p> The tribe of Benjamin was famous for its archers ( 1 Samuel 20:20 1 Samuel 20:36 ;  2 Sam  1:22 ;  1 Chronicles 8:40 ;  12:2 ) and slingers (Judge.  20:6 ).  </p><p> The gate of Benjamin, on the north side of Jerusalem ( Jeremiah 37:13 ;  38:7 ;  Zechariah 14:10 ), was so called because it led in the direction of the territory of the tribe of Benjamin. It is called by ( Jeremiah 20:2 ) "the high gate of Benjamin;" also "the gate of the children of the people" ( 17:19 ). (Compare  2 Kings 14:13 .)  </p> </li>
Beor	<p>a torch. </p><li> The father of Bela, one of the kings of Edom ( Genesis 36:32 ).  </li><li> The father of Balaam ( Numbers 22:5 ;  Numbers 24:3 Numbers 24:15 ;  31:8 ). In  2 Peter 2:15  he is called Bosor.   </li>
Bera	<p>gift, or son of evil, king of Sodom at the time of the invasion of the four kings under Chedorlaomer ( Genesis 14:2 Genesis 14:8 Genesis 14:17 Genesis 14:21 ).  </p>
Berachah	<p>blessing. </p><li> A valley not far from Engedi, where Jehoshaphat overthrew the Moabites and Ammonites ( 2 Chronicles 20:26 ). It has been identified with the valley of Bereikut. (RSV, "Beracah.")  </li><li> One of the Benjamite warriors, Saul's brethren, who joined David when at Ziklag ( 1 Chronicles 12:3 ).   </li>
Cab	<p>hollow (RSV, "kab"), occurs only in  2 Kings 6:25 ; a dry measure, the sixth part of a seah, and the eighteenth part of an ephah, equal to about two English quarts.  </p>
Cabins	<p>only in  Jeremiah 37:16  (RSV, "cells"), arched vaults or recesses off a passage or room; cells for the closer confinement of prisoners.  </p>
Cabul	<p>how little! as nothing. </p><li> A town on the eastern border of Asher ( Joshua 19:27 ), probably one of the towns given by Solomon to Hiram; the modern Kabul, some 8 miles east of Accho, on the very borders of Galilee.  </li><li> A district in the north-west of Galilee, near to Tyre, containing twenty cities given to Hiram by Solomon as a reward for various services rendered to him in building the temple ( 1 Kings 9:13 ), and as payment of the six score talents of gold he had borrowed from him. Hiram gave the cities this name because he was not pleased with the gift, the name signifying "good for nothing." Hiram seems afterwards to have restored these cities to Solomon ( 2 Chronicles 8:2 ).   </li>
Caesar	<p>the title assumed by the Roman emperors after Julius Caesar. In the New Testament this title is given to various emperors as sovereigns of Judaea without their accompanying distinctive proper names ( John 19:15 ;  Acts 17:7 ). The Jews paid tribute to Caesar ( Matthew 22:17 ), and all Roman citizens had the right of appeal to him ( Acts 25:11 ). The Caesars referred to in the New Testament are Augustus ( Luke 2:1 ), Tiberius ( 3:1 ;  20:22 ), Claudius ( Acts 11:28 ), and Nero ( Acts 25:8 ; Phil  4:22 ).  </p>
Caesara Philippi	<p>a city on the northeast of the marshy plain of el-Huleh, 120 miles north of Jerusalem, and 20 miles north of the Sea of Galilee, at the "upper source" of the Jordan, and near the base of Mount Hermon. It is mentioned in  Matthew 16:13  and  Mark 8:27  as the northern limit of our Lord's public ministry. According to some its original name was Baal-Gad ( Joshua 11:17 ), or Baal-Hermon ( Judges 3:3 ;  1 Chronicles 5:23 ), when it was a Canaanite sanctuary of Baal. It was afterwards called Panium or Paneas, from a deep cavern full of water near the town. This name was given to the cavern by the Greeks of the Macedonian kingdom of Antioch because of its likeness to the grottos of Greece, which were always associated with the worship of their god Pan. Its modern name is Banias. Here Herod built a temple, which he dedicated to Augustus Caesar. This town was afterwards enlarged and embellished by Herod Philip, the tetrarch of Trachonitis, of whose territory it formed a part, and was called by him Caesarea Philippi, partly after his own name, and partly after that of the emperor Tiberius Caesar. It is thus distinguished from the Caesarea of Palestine. (See JORDAN .) </p>
Caesarea	<p>(Palestinae), a city on the shore of the Mediterranean, on the great road from Tyre to Egypt, about 70 miles northwest of Jerusalem, at the northern extremity of the plain of Sharon. It was built by Herod the Great (B.C. 10), who named it after Caesar Augustus, hence called Caesarea Sebaste (Gr. Sebastos = "Augustus"), on the site of an old town called "Strato's Tower." It was the capital of the Roman province of Judaea, the seat of the governors or procurators, and the headquarters of the Roman troops. It was the great Gentile city of Palestine, with a spacious artificial harbour. It was adorned with many buildings of great splendour, after the manner of the Roman cities of the West. Here Cornelius the centurion was converted through the instrumentality of Peter ( Acts 10:1 Acts 10:24 ), and thus for the first time the door of faith was opened to the Gentiles. Philip the evangelist resided here with his four daughters ( 21:8 ). From this place Saul sailed for his native Tarsus when forced to flee from Jerusalem ( 9:30 ), and here he landed when returning from his second missionary journey ( 18:22 ). He remained as a prisoner here for two years before his voyage to Rome ( Acts 24:27 ;  Acts 25:1 Acts 25:4 Acts 25:6 Acts 25:13 ). Here on a "set day," when games were celebrated in the theatre in honour of the emperor Claudius, Herod Agrippa I. appeared among the people in great pomp, and in the midst of the idolatrous homage paid to him was suddenly smitten by an angel, and carried out a dying man. He was "eaten of worms" ( 12:19-23 ), thus perishing by the same loathsome disease as his granfather, Herod the Great. It still retains its ancient name Kaiseriyeh, but is now desolate. "The present inhabitants of the ruins are snakes, scorpions, lizards, wild boars, and jackals." It is described as the most desolate city of all Palestine.  </p>
Cage	<p>(Heb. kelub',  Jeremiah 5:27 , marg. "coop;" rendered "basket" in  Amos 8:1 ), a basket of wicker-work in which birds were placed after being caught. In  Revelation 18:2  it is the rendering of the Greek <i> phulake</i> , properly a prison or place of confinement. </p>
Caiaphas	<p>the Jewish high priest (A.D. 27-36) at the beginning of our Lord's public ministry, in the reign of Tiberius ( Luke 3:2 ), and also at the time of his condemnation and crucifixion ( Matthew 26:3 Matthew 26:57 ;  John 11:49 ;  John 18:13 John 18:14 ). He held this office during the whole of Pilate's administration. His wife was the daughter of Annas, who had formerly been high priest, and was probably the vicar or deputy (Heb. sagan) of Caiaphas. He was of the sect of the Sadducees ( Acts 5:17 ), and was a member of the council when he gave his opinion that Jesus should be put to death "for the people, and that the whole nation perish not" ( John 11:50 ). In these words he unconsciously uttered a prophecy. "Like Saul, he was a prophet in spite of himself." Caiaphas had no power to inflict the punishment of death, and therefore Jesus was sent to Pilate, the Roman governor, that he might duly pronounce the sentence against him ( Matthew 27:2 ;  John 18:28 ). At a later period his hostility to the gospel is still manifest ( Acts 4:6 ). (See ANNAS .) </p>
Cain	<p>a possession; a spear. </p><li> The first-born son of Adam and Eve ( Genesis 4 ). He became a tiller of the ground, as his brother Abel followed the pursuits of pastoral life. He was "a sullen, self-willed, haughty, vindictive man; wanting the religious element in his character, and defiant even in his attitude towards God." It came to pass "in process of time" (marg. "at the end of days"), i.e., probably on the Sabbath, that the two brothers presented their offerings to the Lord. Abel's offering was of the "firstlings of his flock and of the fat," while Cain's was "of the fruit of the ground." Abel's sacrifice was "more excellent" ( Hebrews 11:4 ) than Cain's, and was accepted by God. On this account Cain was "very wroth," and cherished feelings of murderous hatred against his brother, and was at length guilty of the desperate outrage of putting him to death ( 1 John 3:12 ). For this crime he was expelled from Eden, and henceforth led the life of an exile, bearing upon him some mark which God had set upon him in answer to his own cry for mercy, so that thereby he might be protected from the wrath of his fellow-men; or it may be that God only gave him some sign to assure him that he would not be slain ( Genesis 4:15 ). Doomed to be a wanderer and a fugitive in the earth, he went forth into the "land of Nod", i.e., the land of "exile", which is said to have been in the "east of Eden," and there he built a city, the first we read of, and called it after his son's name, Enoch. His descendants are enumerated to the sixth generation. They gradually degenerated in their moral and spiritual condition till they became wholly corrupt before God. This corruption prevailed, and at length the Deluge was sent by God to prevent the final triumph of evil. (See ABEL .) </li><li> A town of the Kenites, a branch of the Midianites ( Joshua 15:57 ), on the east edge of the mountain above Engedi; probably the "nest in a rock" mentioned by Balaam ( Numbers 24:21 ). It is identified with the modern Yekin, 3 miles south-east of Hebron.   </li>
Cainan	<p>possession; smith. </p><li> The fourth antediluvian patriarch, the eldest son of Enos. He was 70 years old at the birth of his eldest son Mahalaleel, after which he lived 840 years ( Genesis 5:9-14 ), and was 910 years old when he died. He is also called Kenan ( 1 Chronicles 1:2 ).  </li><li> The son of Arphaxad ( Luke 3:36 ). He is nowhere named in the Old Testament. He is usually called the "second Cainan."   </li>
Cake	<p>Cakes made of wheat or barley were offered in the temple. They were salted, but unleavened ( Exodus 29:2 ;  Leviticus 2:4 ). In idolatrous worship thin cakes or wafers were offered "to the queen of heaven" ( Jeremiah 7:18 ;  44:19 ).  </p><p> Pancakes are described in  2 Samuel 13:8 2 Samuel 13:9 . Cakes mingled with oil and baked in the oven are mentioned in  Leviticus 2:4 , and "wafers unleavened anointed with oil," in  Exodus 29:2 ;  Leviticus 8:26 ;  1 Chronicles 23:29 . "Cracknels," a kind of crisp cakes, were among the things Jeroboam directed his wife to take with her when she went to consult Ahijah the prophet at Shiloh ( 1 Kings 14:3 ). Such hard cakes were carried by the Gibeonites when they came to ( Joshua 9:5 Joshua 9:12 ). They described their bread as "mouldy;" but the Hebrew word <i> nikuddim</i> , here used, ought rather to be rendered "hard as biscuit." It is rendered "cracknels" in  1 Kings 14:3 . The ordinary bread, when kept for a few days, became dry and excessively hard. The Gibeonites pointed to this hardness of their bread as an evidence that they had come a long journey.  </p><p> We read also of honey-cakes ( Exodus 16:31 ), "cakes of figs" ( 1 Samuel 25:18 ), "cake" as denoting a whole piece of bread ( 1 Kings 17:12 ), and "a [round] cake of barley bread" ( Judges 7:13 ). In  Leviticus 2  is a list of the different kinds of bread and cakes which were fit for offerings.  </p>
Calah	<p>one of the most ancient cities of Assyria. "Out of that land he [i.e., Nimrod] went forth into Assyria, and built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, and Calah, and Resen" ( Genesis 10:11 , RSV). Its site is now marked probably by the Nimrud ruins on the left bank of the Tigris. These cover an area of about 1,000 acres, and are second only in size and importance to the mass of ruins opposite Mosul. This city was at one time the capital of the empire, and was the residence of Sardanapalus and his successors down to the time of Sargon, who built a new capital, the modern Khorsabad. It has been conjectured that these four cities mentioned in  Genesis 10:11  were afterwards all united into one and called Nineveh (q.v.).  </p>
Calamus	<p>the Latin for cane, Hebrew <i> Kaneh</i> , mentioned ( Exodus 30:23 ) as one of the ingredients in the holy anointing oil, one of the sweet scents (Cant  4:14 ), and among the articles sold in the markets of Tyre ( Ezekiel 27:19 ). The word designates an Oriental plant called the "sweet flag," the Acorus calamus of Linnaeus. It is elsewhere called "sweet cane" ( Isaiah 43:24 ;  Jeremiah 6:20 ). It has an aromatic smell, and when its knotted stalk is cut and dried and reduced to powder, it forms an ingredient in the most precious perfumes. It was not a native of Palestine, but was imported from Arabia Felix or from India. It was probably that which is now known in India by the name of "lemon grass" or "ginger grass," the Andropogon schoenanthus. (See CANE .) </p>
Calcol	<p>( 1 Chronicles 2:6 ), sustenance, the same probably as Chalcol ( 1 Kings 4:31 ), one of the four sages whom Solomon excelled in wisdom; for "he was wiser than all men."  </p>
Caleb	<p>a dog. </p><li> One of the three sons of Hezron of the tribe of Judah. He is also called Chelubai ( 1 Chronicles 2:9 ). His descendants are enumerated (18-20,42-49).  </li><li> A "son of Hur, the firstborn of Ephratah" ( 1 Chronicles 2:50 ). Some would read the whole passage thus: "These [i.e., the list in ver. 42-49] were the sons of Caleb. The sons of Hur, the firstborn of Ephratah, were Shobal, etc." Thus Hur would be the name of the son and not the father of Caleb (ver. 19).  </li><li> The son of Jephunneh ( Numbers 13:6 ;  32:12 ;  Joshua 14:6 Joshua 14:14 ). He was one of those whom Moses sent to search the land in the second year after the Exodus. He was one of the family chiefs of the tribe of Judah. He and Joshua the son of Nun were the only two of the whole number who encouraged the people to go up and possess the land, and they alone were spared when a plague broke out in which the other ten spies perished ( Numbers 13 ;  14 ). All the people that had been numbered, from twenty years old and upward, perished in the wilderness except these two. The last notice we have of Caleb is when (being then eighty-five years of age) he came to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal, after the people had gained possession of the land, and reminded him of the promise Moses had made to him, by virtue of which he claimed a certain portion of the land of Kirjath-arba as his inheritance ( Joshua 14:6-15 ;  15:13-15 ;  21:10-12 ;  1 Samuel 25:2 1 Samuel 25:3 ;  30:14 ). He is called a "Kenezite" in  Joshua 14:6 Joshua 14:14 . This may simply mean "son of Kenez" ( Numbers 32:12 ). Some, however, read "Jephunneh, the son of Kenez," who was a descendant of Hezron, the son of Pharez, a grandson of Judah ( 1 Chronicles 2:5 ). This Caleb may possibly be identical with (2).  </li><li> Caleb gave his name apparently to a part of the south country ( 1 Samuel 30:14 ) of Judah, the district between Hebron and Carmel, which had been assigned to him. When he gave up the city of Hebron to the priests as a city of refuge, he retained possession of the surrounding country ( Joshua 21:11 Joshua 21:12 ; Compare  1 Samuel 25:3 ).   </li>
Calf	<p>Calves were commonly made use of in sacrifices, and are therefore frequently mentioned in Scripture. The "fatted calf" was regarded as the choicest of animal food; it was frequently also offered as a special sacrifice ( 1 Samuel 28:24 ;  Amos 6:4 ;  Luke 15:23 ). The words used in  Jeremiah 34:18 Jeremiah 34:19 , "cut the calf in twain," allude to the custom of dividing a sacrifice into two parts, between which the parties ratifying a covenant passed ( Genesis 15:9 Genesis 15:10 Genesis 15:17 Genesis 15:18 ). The sacrifice of the lips, i.e., priase, is called "the calves of our lips" ( Hosea 14:2 , RSV, "as bullocks the offering of our lips." Compare  Hebrews 13:15 ;  Psalms 116:7 ;  Jeremiah 33:11 ).  </p><p> The golden calf which Aaron made ( Exodus 32:4 ) was probably a copy of the god Moloch rather than of the god Apis, the sacred ox or calf of Egypt. The Jews showed all through their history a tendency toward the Babylonian and Canaanitish idolatry rather than toward that of Egypt.  </p><p> Ages after this, Jeroboam, king of Israel, set up two idol calves, one at Dan, and the other at Bethel, that he might thus prevent the ten tribes from resorting to Jerusalem for worship ( 1 Kings 12:28 ). These calves continued to be a snare to the people till the time of their captivity. The calf at Dan was carried away in the reign of Pekah by Tiglath-pileser, and that at Bethel ten years later, in the reign of Hoshea, by Shalmaneser ( 2 Kings 15:29 ;  17:33 ). This sin of Jeroboam is almost always mentioned along with his name ( 2 Kings 15:28  etc.).  </p>
Calkers	<p>workmen skilled in stopping the seams of the deck or sides of vessels. The inhabitants of Gebel were employed in such work on Tyrian vessels ( Ezekiel 27:9 Ezekiel 27:27 ; marg., "strengtheners" or "stoppers of chinks").  </p>
Call	<p></p><li> To cry for help, hence to pray ( Genesis 4:26 ). Thus men are said to "call upon the name of the Lord" ( Acts 2:21 ;  7:59 ;  9:14 ;  Romans 10:12 ;  1 Corinthians 1:2 ).  </li><li> God calls with respect to men when he designates them to some special office ( Exodus 31:2 ;  Isaiah 22:20 ;  Acts 13:2 ), and when he invites them to accept his offered grace ( Matthew 9:13 ;  11:28 ;  22:4 ).  <p> In the message of the gospel his call is addressed to all men, to Jews and Gentiles alike ( Matthew 28:19 ;  Mark 16:15 ;  Romans 9:24 Romans 9:25 ). But this universal call is not inseparably connected with salvation, although it leaves all to whom it comes inexcusable if they reject it ( John 3:14-19 ;  Matthew 22:14 ).  </p><p> An effectual call is something more than the outward message of the Word of God to men. It is internal, and is the result of the enlightening and sanctifying influence of the Holy Spirit ( John 16:14 ;  Acts 26: :  18 ;  John 6:44 ), effectually drawing men to Christ, and disposing and enabling them to receive the truth ( John 6:45 ;  Acts 16:14 ;  Ephesians 1:17 ).  </p> </li>
Calling	<p>a profession, or as we usually say, a vocation ( 1 Corinthians 7:20 ). The "hope of your calling" in  Ephesians 4:4  is the hope resulting from your being called into the kingdom of God.  </p>
Calneh	<p>fort, one of the four cities founded by Nimrod ( Genesis 10:10 ). It is the modern Niffer, a lofty mound of earth and rubbish situated in the marshes on the left, i.e., the east, bank of the Euphrates, but 30 miles distant from its present course, and about 60 miles south-south-east from Babylon. It is mentioned as one of the towns with which Tyre carried on trade. It was finally taken and probably destroyed by one of the Assyrian kings ( Amos 6:2 ). It is called Calno ( Isaiah 10:9 ) and Canneh ( Ezekiel 27:23 ).  </p>
Calvary	<p>only in  Luke 23:33 , the Latin name Calvaria, which was used as a translation of the Greek word <i> Kranion</i> , by which the Hebrew word <i> Gulgoleth</i> was interpreted, "the place of a skull." It probably took this name from its shape, being a hillock or low, rounded, bare elevation somewhat in the form of a human skull. It is nowhere in Scripture called a "hill." The crucifixion of our Lord took place outside the city walls ( Hebrews 13:11-13 ) and near the public thoroughfare. "This thing was not done in a corner." (See GOLGOTHA .) </p>
Camel	<p>from the Hebrew <i> gamal</i> , "to repay" or "requite," as the camel does the care of its master. There are two distinct species of camels, having, however, the common characteristics of being "ruminants without horns, without muzzle, with nostrils forming oblique slits, the upper lip divided and separately movable and extensile, the soles of the feet horny, with two toes covered by claws, the limbs long, the abdomen drawn up, while the neck, long and slender, is bent up and down, the reverse of that of a horse, which is arched." </p><li> The Bactrian camel is distinguished by two humps. It is a native of the high table-lands of Central Asia.  </li><li> The Arabian camel or dromedary, from the Greek <i> dromos</i> , "a runner" ( Isaiah 60:6 ;  Jeremiah 2:23 ), has but one hump, and is a native of Western Asia or Africa.  <p> The camel was early used both for riding and as a beast of burden ( Genesis 24:64 ;  37:25 ), and in war ( 1 Samuel 30:17 ;  Isaiah 21:7 ). Mention is made of the camel among the cattle given by Pharaoh to Abraham ( Genesis 12:16 ). Its flesh was not to be eaten, as it was ranked among unclean animals ( Leviticus 11:4 ;  Deuteronomy 14:7 ). Abraham's servant rode on a camel when he went to fetch a wife for Isaac ( Genesis 24:10 Genesis 24:11 ). Jacob had camels as a portion of his wealth ( 30:43 ), as Abraham also had ( 24:35 ). He sent a present of thirty milch camels to his brother Esau ( 32:15 ). It appears to have been little in use among the Jews after the conquest. It is, however, mentioned in the history of David ( 1 Chronicles 27:30 ), and after the Exile ( Ezra 2:67 ;  Nehemiah 7:69 ). Camels were much in use among other nations in the East. The queen of Sheba came with a caravan of camels when she came to see the wisdom of Solomon ( 1 Kings 10:2 ;  2 Chr  9:1 ). Benhadad of Damascus also sent a present to Elisha, "forty camels' burden" ( 2 Kings 8:9 ).  </p><p> To show the difficulty in the way of a rich man's entering into the kingdom, our Lord uses the proverbial expression that it was easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle ( Matthew 19:24 ).  </p><p> To strain at (rather, out) a gnat and swallow a camel was also a proverbial expression ( Matthew 23:24 ), used with reference to those who were careful to avoid small faults, and yet did not hesitate to commit the greatest sins. The Jews carefully filtered their wine before drinking it, for fear of swallowing along with it some insect forbidden in the law as unclean, and yet they omitted openly the "weightier matters" of the law.  </p><p> The raiment worn by John the Baptist was made of camel's hair ( Matthew 3:4 ;  Mark 1:6 ), by which he was distinguished from those who resided in royal palaces and wore soft raiment. This was also the case with Elijah ( 2 Kings 1:8 ), who is called "a hairy man," from his wearing such raiment. "This is one of the most admirable materials for clothing; it keeps out the heat, cold, and rain." The "sackcloth" so often alluded to ( 2 Kings 1:8 ;  Isaiah 15:3 ;  Zechariah 13:4 , etc.) was probably made of camel's hair.  </p> </li>
Camon	<p>full of stalks, a place ( Judges 10:5 ) where Jair was buried. It has usually been supposed to have been a city of Gilead, on the east of Jordan. It is probably, however, the modern Tell-el-Kaimun, on the southern slopes of Carmel, the Jokneam of Carmel ( Joshua 12:22 ;  1 Kings 4:12 ), since it is not at all unlikely that after he became judge, Jair might find it more convenient to live on the west side of Jordan; and that he was buried where he had lived.  </p>
Camp	<p>During their journeys across the wilderness, the twelve tribes formed encampments at the different places where they halted ( Exodus 16:13 ;  Numbers 2:3 ). The diagram here given shows the position of the different tribes and the form of the encampment during the wanderings, according to  Numbers 1:53 ;  2:2-31 ;  Numbers 3:29 Numbers 3:35 Numbers 3:38 ;  10:13-28 .  </p><p> The area of the camp would be in all about 3 square miles. After the Hebrews entered Palestine, the camps then spoken of were exclusively warlike ( Joshua 11:5 Joshua 11:7 ;  Judges 5:19 Judges 5:21 ;  7:1 ;  1 Samuel 29:1 ;  30:9 , etc.).  </p>
Camphire	<p>(Heb. copher), mentioned in Cant  1:14  (RSV, "henna-flowers");  4:13  (RSV, "henna"), is the al-henna of the Arabs, a native of Egypt, producing clusters of small white and yellow odoriferous flowers, whence is made the Oleum Cyprineum. From its leaves is made the peculiar auburn dye with which Eastern women stain their nails and the palms of their hands. It is found only at Engedi, on the shore of the Dead Sea. It is known to botanists by the name Lawsonia alba or inermis, a kind of privet, which grows 6 or 8 feet high. The margin of the Authorized Version of the passages above referred to has "or cypress," not with reference to the conifer so called, but to the circumstance that one of the most highly appreciated species of this plant grew in the island of Cyprus.  </p>
Cana	<p>reedy, a town of Galilee, near Capernaum. Here our Lord wrought his first miracle, the turning of water into wine ( John 2:1-11 ;  4:46 ). It is also mentioned as the birth-place of Nathanael ( 21:2 ). It is not mentioned in the Old Testament. It has been identified with the modern Kana el-Jelil, also called Khurbet Kana, a place 8 or 9 miles north of Nazareth. Others have identified it with Kefr Kenna, which lies on the direct road to the Sea of Galilee, about 5 miles north-east of Nazareth, and 12 in a direct course from Tiberias. It is called "Cana of Galilee," to distinguish it from Cana of Asher ( Joshua 19:28 ).  </p>
Canaan	<p></p><li> The fourth son of Ham ( Genesis 10:6 ). His descendants were under a curse in consequence of the transgression of his father ( 9:22-27 ). His eldest son, Zidon, was the father of the Sidonians and Phoenicians. He had eleven sons, who were the founders of as many tribes ( 10:15-18 ).  </li><li> The country which derived its name from the preceding. The name as first used by the Phoenicians denoted only the maritime plain on which Sidon was built. But in the time of Moses and Joshua it denoted the whole country to the west of the Jordan and the Dead Sea ( Deuteronomy 11:30 ). In  Joshua 5:12  the LXX. read, "land of the Phoenicians," instead of "land of Canaan."  <p> The name signifies "the lowlands," as distinguished from the land of Gilead on the east of Jordan, which was a mountainous district. The extent and boundaries of Canaan are fully set forth in different parts of Scripture ( Genesis 10:19 ;  17:8 ;  Numbers 13:29 ;  34:8 ). (See CANAANITES,  PALESTINE .) </p> </li>
Canaan, the language of	<p>mentioned in  Isaiah 19:18 , denotes the language spoken by the Jews resident in Palestine. The language of the Canaanites and of the Hebrews was substantially the same. This is seen from the fragments of the Phoenician language which still survive, which show the closest analogy to the Hebrew. Yet the subject of the language of the "Canaanites" is very obscure. The cuneiform writing of Babylon, as well as the Babylonian language, was taught in the Canaanitish schools, and the clay tablets of Babylonian literature were stored in the Canaanitish libraries. Even the Babylonian divinities were borrowed by the Canaanites.  </p>
Canaanite	<p>a name given to the apostle Simon ( Matthew 10:4 ;  Mark 3:18 ). The word here does not, however, mean a descendant of Canaan, but is a translation, or rather almost a transliteration, of the Syriac word Kanenyeh (RSV rendered "Cananaen"), which designates the Jewish sect of the Zealots. Hence he is called elsewhere ( Luke 6:15 ) "Simon Zelotes;" i.e., Simon of the sect of the Zealots. (See SIMON .) </p>
Canaanites	<p>the descendants of Canaan, the son of Ham. Migrating from their original home, they seem to have reached the Persian Gulf, and to have there sojourned for some time. They thence "spread to the west, across the mountain chain of Lebanon to the very edge of the Mediterranean Sea, occupying all the land which later became Palestine, also to the north-west as far as the mountain chain of Taurus. This group was very numerous, and broken up into a great many peoples, as we can judge from the list of nations ( Genesis 10 ), the 'sons of Canaan.'" Six different tribes are mentioned in  Exodus 3:8 Exodus 3:17 ;  23:23 ;  33:2 ;  34:11 . In  Exodus 13:5  the "Perizzites" are omitted. The "Girgashites" are mentioned in addition to the foregoing in  Deuteronomy 7:1 ;  Joshua 3:10 .  </p><p> The "Canaanites," as distinguished from the Amalekites, the Anakim, and the Rephaim, were "dwellers in the lowlands" ( Numbers 13:29 ), the great plains and valleys, the richest and most important parts of Palestine. Tyre and Sidon, their famous cities, were the centres of great commercial activity; and hence the name "Canaanite" came to signify a "trader" or "merchant" ( Job 41:6 ;  Proverbs 31:24 , lit. "Canaanites;" Compare  Zephaniah 1:11 ;  Ezekiel 17:4 ). The name "Canaanite" is also sometimes used to designate the non-Israelite inhabitants of the land in general ( Genesis 12:6 ;  Numbers 21:3 ;  Judges 1:10 ).  </p><p> The Israelites, when they were led to the Promised Land, were commanded utterly to destroy the descendants of Canaan then possessing it ( Exodus 23:23 ;  Numbers 33:52 Numbers 33:53 ;  Deuteronomy 20:16 Deuteronomy 20:17 ). This was to be done "by little and little," lest the beasts of the field should increase ( Exodus 23:29 ;  Deuteronomy 7:22 Deuteronomy 7:23 ). The history of these wars of conquest is given in the Book of Joshua. The extermination of these tribes, however, was never fully carried out. Jerusalem was not taken till the time of David ( 2 Samuel 5:6 2 Samuel 5:7 ). In the days of Solomon bond-service was exacted from the fragments of the tribes still remaining in the land ( 1 Kings 9:20 1 Kings 9:21 ). Even after the return from captivity survivors of five of the Canaanitish tribes were still found in the land.  </p><p> In the Tell-el-Amarna tablets Canaan is found under the forms of Kinakhna and Kinakhkhi. Under the name of Kanana the Canaanites appear on Egyptian monuments, wearing a coat of mail and helmet, and distinguished by the use of spear and javelin and the battle-axe. They were called Phoenicians by the Greeks and Poeni by the Romans. By race the Canaanites were Semitic. They were famous as merchants and seamen, as well as for their artistic skill. The chief object of their worship was the sun-god, who was addressed by the general name of Baal, "lord." Each locality had its special Baal, and the various local Baals were summed up under the name of Baalim, "lords." </p>
Candace	<p>the queen of the Ethiopians whose "eunuch" or chamberlain was converted to Christianity by the instrumentality of Philip the evangelist ( Acts 8:27 ). The country which she ruled was called by the Greeks Meroe, in Upper Nubia. It was long the centre of commercial intercourse between Africa and the south of Asia, and hence became famous for its wealth ( Isaiah 45:14 ).  </p><p> It is somewhat singular that female sovereignty seems to have prevailed in Ethiopia, the name Candace (compare "Pharaoh," "Ptolemy," "Caesar") being a title common to several successive queens. It is probable that Judaism had taken root in Ethiopia at this time, and hence the visit of the queen's treasurer to Jerusalem to keep the feast. There is a tradition that Candace was herself converted to Christianity by her treasurer on his return, and that he became the apostle of Christianity in that whole region, carrying it also into Abyssinia. It is said that he also preached the gospel in Arabia Felix and in Ceylon, where he suffered martyrdom. (See PHILIP .) </p>
Candle	<p>Heb. ner,  Job 18:6 ;  29:3 ;  Psalms 18:28 ;  Proverbs 24:20 , in all which places the Revised Version and margin of Authorized Version have "lamp," by which the word is elsewhere frequently rendered. The Hebrew word denotes properly any kind of candle or lamp or torch. It is used as a figure of conscience ( Proverbs 20:27 ), of a Christian example ( Matthew 5:14 Matthew 5:15 ), and of prosperity ( Job 21:17 ;  Proverbs 13:9 ).  </p>
Candlestick	<p>the lamp-stand, "candelabrum," which Moses was commanded to make for the tabernacle, according to the pattern shown him. Its form is described in  Exodus 25:31-40 ;  37:17-24 , and may be seen represented on the Arch of Titus at Rome. It was among the spoils taken by the Romans from the temple of Jerusalem (A.D. 70). It was made of fine gold, and with the utensils belonging to it was a talent in weight.  </p><p> The tabernacle was a tent without windows, and thus artificial light was needed. This was supplied by the candlestick, which, however, served also as a symbol of the church or people of God, who are "the light of the world." The light which "symbolizes the knowledge of God is not the sun or any natural light, but an artificial light supplied with a specially prepared oil; for the knowledge of God is in truth not natural nor common to all men, but furnished over and above nature." </p><p> This candlestick was placed on the south side of the Holy Place, opposite the table of shewbread ( Exodus 27:21 ;  Exodus 30:7 Exodus 30:8 ;  Leviticus 24:3 ;  1 Samuel 3:3 ). It was lighted every evening, and was extinguished in the morning. In the morning the priests trimmed the seven lamps, borne by the seven branches, with golden snuffers, carrying away the ashes in golden dishes ( Exodus 25:38 ), and supplying the lamps at the same time with fresh oil. What ultimately became of the candlestick is unknown.  </p><p> In Solomon's temple there were ten separate candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right and five on the left of the Holy Place ( 1 Kings 7:49 ;  2 Chr  4:7 ). Their structure is not mentioned. They were carried away to Babylon ( Jeremiah 52:19 ).  </p><p> In the temple erected after the Exile there was again but one candlestick, and like the first, with seven branches. It was this which was afterwards carried away by Titus to Rome, where it was deposited in the Temple of Peace. When Genseric plundered Rome, he is said to have carried it to Carthage (A.D. 455). It was recaptured by Belisarius (A.D. 533), and carried to Constantinople and thence to Jerusalem, where it finally disappeared.  </p>
Cane	<p>a tall sedgy plant with a hollow stem, growing in moist places. In  Isaiah 43:24 ;  Jeremiah 6:20 , the Hebrew word <i> kaneh</i> is thus rendered, giving its name to the plant. It is rendered "reed" in  1 Kings 14:15 ;  Job 40:21 ;  Isaiah 19:6 ;  35:7 . In  Psalms 68:30  the expression "company of spearmen" is in the margin and the Revised Version "beasts of the reeds," referring probably to the crocodile or the hippopotamus as a symbol of Egypt. In  2 Kings 18:21 ;  Isaiah 36:6 ;  Ezekiel 29:6 Ezekiel 29:7 , the reference is to the weak, fragile nature of the reed. (See CALAMUS .) </p>
Canker	<p>a gangrene or mortification which gradually spreads over the whole body ( 2 Timothy 2:17 ). In  James 5:3  "cankered" means "rusted" (RSV) or tarnished.  </p>
Cankerworm	<p>(Heb. yelek), "the licking locust," which licks up the grass of the field; probably the locust at a certain stage of its growth, just as it emerges from the caterpillar state ( Joel 1:4 ;  2:25 ). The word is rendered "caterpillar" in  Psalms 105:34 ; Jer 51:14,17(but RSV "canker-worm"). "It spoileth and fleeth away" ( Nahum 3:16 ), or as some read the passage, "The cankerworm putteth off [i.e., the envelope of its wings], and fleeth away."  </p>
Canneh	<p>Mentioned only in  Ezekiel 27:23 . (See CALNEH .) </p>
Canon	<p>This word is derived from a Hebrew and Greek word denoting a reed or cane. Hence it means something straight, or something to keep straight; and hence also a rule, or something ruled or measured. It came to be applied to the Scriptures, to denote that they contained the authoritative rule of faith and practice, the standard of doctrine and duty. A book is said to be of canonical authority when it has a right to take a place with the other books which contain a revelation of the Divine will. Such a right does not arise from any ecclesiastical authority, but from the evidence of the inspired authorship of the book. The canonical (i.e., the inspired) books of the Old and New Testaments, are a complete rule, and the only rule, of faith and practice. They contain the whole supernatural revelation of God to men. The New Testament Canon was formed gradually under divine guidance. The different books as they were written came into the possession of the Christian associations which began to be formed soon after the day of Pentecost; and thus slowly the canon increased till all the books were gathered together into one collection containing the whole of the twenty-seven New Testament inspired books. Historical evidence shows that from about the middle of the second century this New Testament collection was substantially such as we now possess. Each book contained in it is proved to have, on its own ground, a right to its place; and thus the whole is of divine authority. </p><p> The Old Testament Canon is witnessed to by the New Testament writers. Their evidence is conclusive. The quotations in the New from the Old are very numerous, and the references are much more numerous. These quotations and references by our Lord and the apostles most clearly imply the existence at that time of a well-known and publicly acknowledged collection of Hebrew writings under the designation of "The Scriptures;" "The Law and the Prophets and the Psalms;" "Moses and the Prophets," etc. The appeals to these books, moreover, show that they were regarded as of divine authority, finally deciding all questions of which they treat; and that the whole collection so recognized consisted only of the thirty-nine books which we now posses. Thus they endorse as genuine and authentic the canon of the Jewish Scriptures. The Septuagint Version (q.v.) also contained every book we now have in the Old Testament Scriptures. As to the time at which the Old Testament canon was closed, there are many considerations which point to that of Ezra and Nehemiah, immediately after the return from Babylonian exile. (See BIBLE, EZRA, QUOTATIONS .) </p>
Capernaum	<p>Nahum's town, a Galilean city frequently mentioned in the history of our Lord. It is not mentioned in the Old Testament. After our Lord's expulsion from Nazareth ( Matthew 4:13-16 ;  Luke 4:16-31 ), Capernaum became his "own city." It was the scene of many acts and incidents of his life ( Matthew 8:5 Matthew 8:14 Matthew 8:15 ;  Matthew 9:2-6 Matthew 9:10-17 ;  15:1-20 ;  Mark 1:32-34 , etc.). The impenitence and unbelief of its inhabitants after the many evidences our Lord gave among them of the truth of his mission, brought down upon them a heavy denunciation of judgement ( Matthew 11:23 ).  </p><p> It stood on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. The "land of Gennesaret," near, if not in, which it was situated, was one of the most prosperous and crowded districts of Palestine. This city lay on the great highway from Damascus to Acco and Tyre. It has been identified with Tell Hum, about two miles south-west of where the Jordan flows into the lake. Here are extensive ruins of walls and foundations, and also the remains of what must have been a beautiful synagogue, which it is conjectured may have been the one built by the centurion ( Luke 7:5 ), in which our Lord frequently taught ( John 6:59 ;  Mark 1:21 ;  Luke 4:33 ). Others have conjectured that the ruins of the city are to be found at Khan Minyeh, some three miles further to the south on the shore of the lake. "If Tell Hum be Capernaum, the remains spoken of are without doubt the ruins of the synagogue built by the Roman centurion, and one of the most sacred places on earth. It was in this building that our Lord gave the well-known discourse in  John 6 ; and it was not without a certain strange feeling that on turning over a large block we found the pot of manna engraved on its face, and remembered the words, 'I am that bread of life: your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.'", (The Recovery of Jerusalem.)  </p>
Caphtor	<p>a chaplet, the original seat of the Philistines ( Deuteronomy 2:23 ;  Jeremiah 47:4 ;  Amos 9:7 ). The name is found written in hieroglyphics in the temple of Kom Ombos in Upper Egypt. But the exact situation of Caphtor is unknown, though it is supposed to be Crete, since the Philistines seem to be meant by the "Cherethites" in  1 Samuel 30:14  (see also  2 Samuel 8:18 ). It may, however, have been a part of Egypt, the Caphtur in the north Delta, since the Caphtorim were of the same race as the Mizraite people ( Genesis 10:14 ;  1 Chronicles 1:12 ).  </p>
Cappadocia	<p>the easternmost and the largest province of Asia Minor. Christianity very early penetrated into this country ( 1 Peter 1:1 ). On the day of Pentecost there were Cappadocians at Jerusalem ( Acts 2:9 ).  </p>
Captain	<p></p><li> Heb. sar ( 1 Samuel 22:2 ;  2 Sam  23:19 ). Rendered "chief,"  Genesis 40:2 ;  41:9 ; rendered also "prince,"  Daniel 1:7 ; "ruler,"  Judges 9:30 ; "governor,'  1 Kings 22:26 . This same Hebrew word denotes a military captain ( Exodus 18:21 ;  2 Kings  1:9 ;  Deuteronomy 1:15 ;  1 Samuel 18:13 , etc.), the "captain of the body-guard" ( Genesis 37:36 ;  39:1 ;  41:10 ;  Jeremiah 40:1 ), or, as the word may be rendered, "chief of the executioners" (marg.). The officers of the king's body-guard frequently acted as executioners. Nebuzar-adan ( Jeremiah 39:13 ) and Arioch ( Daniel 2:14 ) held this office in Babylon.  <p> The "captain of the guard" mentioned in  Acts 28:16  was the Praetorian prefect, the commander of the Praetorian troops.  </p></li><li> Another word (Heb. katsin) so translated denotes sometimes a military ( Joshua 10:24 ;  Judges 11:6 Judges 11:11 ;  Isaiah 22:3  "rulers;"  Daniel 11:18 ) and sometimes a civil command, a judge, magistrate, Arab. <i> kady</i> , ( Isaiah 1:10 ;  3:6 ;  Micah 3:1 Micah 3:9 ).  </li><li> It is also the rendering of a Hebrew word (shalish) meaning "a third man," or "one of three." The LXX. render in plural by <i> tristatai</i> ; i.e., "soldiers fighting from chariots," so called because each war-chariot contained three men, one of whom acted as charioteer while the other two fought ( Exodus 14:7 ;  15:4 ;  1 Kings 9:22 ; Compare  2 Kings 9:25 ). This word is used also to denote the king's body-guard ( 2 Kings 10:25 ;  1 Chronicles 12:18 ;  2 Chr  11:11 ) or aides-de-camp.  </li><li> The "captain of the temple" mentioned in  Acts 4:1  and  5:24  was not a military officer, but superintendent of the guard of priests and Levites who kept watch in the temple by night. (Compare "the ruler of the house of God,"  1 Chronicles 9:11 ;  2 Chr.  31:13 ;  Nehemiah 11:11 .)  </li><li> The Captain of our salvation is a name given to our Lord ( Hebrews 2:10 ), because he is the author and source of our salvation, the head of his people, whom he is conducting to glory. The "captain of the Lord's host" ( Joshua 5:14 Joshua 5:15 ) is the name given to that mysterious person who manifested himself to Abraham ( Genesis 12:7 ), and to Moses in the bush ( Exodus 3:2 Exodus 3:6 , etc.) the Angel of the covenant. (See ANGEL .)  </li>
Captive	<p>one taken in war. Captives were often treated with great cruelty and indignity ( 1 Kings 20:32 ;  Joshua 10:24 ;  Judges 1:7 ;  2 Sam.  4:12 ;  Judges 8:7 ;  2 Sam  <span class="badLink">12:31</span> ;  1 Chronicles 20:3 ). When a city was taken by assault, all the men were slain, and the women and children carried away captive and sold as slaves ( Isaiah 20 ;  47:3 ;  2 Chr  28:9-15 ;  Psalms 44:12 ;  Joel 3:3 ), and exposed to the most cruel treatment ( Nahum 3:10 ;  Zechariah 14:2 ;  Esther 3:13 ;  2 Kings  8:12 ;  Isaiah 13:16 Isaiah 13:18 ). Captives were sometimes carried away into foreign countries, as was the case with the Jews ( Jeremiah 20:5 ;  Jeremiah 39:9 Jeremiah 39:10 ;  40:7 ).  </p>
Captivity	<p></p><li> Of Israel. The kingdom of the ten tribes was successively invaded by several Assyrian kings. Pul (q.v.) imposed a tribute on Menahem of a thousand talents of silver ( 2 Kings 15:19 2 Kings 15:20 ;  1 Chronicles 5:26 ) (B.C. 762), and Tiglath-pileser, in the days of Pekah (B.C. 738), carried away the trans-Jordanic tribes and the inhabitants of Galilee into Assyria ( 2 Kings 15:29 ;  Isaiah 9:1 ). Subsequently Shalmaneser invaded Israel and laid siege to Samaria, the capital of the kingdom. During the siege he died, and was succeeded by Sargon, who took the city, and transported the great mass of the people into Assyria (B.C. 721), placing them in Halah and in Habor, and in the cities of the Medes ( 2 Kings 17:3 2 Kings 17:5 ). Samaria was never again inhabited by the Israelites. The families thus removed were carried to distant cities, many of them not far from the Caspian Sea, and their place was supplied by colonists from Babylon and Cuthah, etc. ( 2 Kings 17:24 ). Thus terminated the kingdom of the ten tribes, after a separate duration of two hundred and fifty-five years (B.C. 975-721).  <p> Many speculations have been indulged in with reference to these ten tribes. But we believe that all, except the number that probably allied themselves with Judah and shared in their restoration under Cyrus, are finally lost. </p><p> "Like the dew on the mountain, Like the  foam on the river,  Like the bubble on the fountain,  They are gone, and for ever." </p></li><li> Of Judah. In the third year of Jehoiachim, the eighteenth king of Judah (B.C. 605), Nebuchadnezzar having overcome the Egyptians at Carchemish, advanced to Jerusalem with a great army. After a brief siege he took that city, and carried away the vessels of the sanctuary to Babylon, and dedicated them in the Temple of Belus ( 2 Kings 24:1 ;  2 Chr  <span class="badLink">2 Kings 36:6</span> <span class="badLink">2 Kings 36:7</span> ;  Daniel 1:1 Daniel 1:2 ). He also carried away the treasures of the king, whom he made his vassal. At this time, from which is dated the "seventy years" of captivity ( Jeremiah 25 ;  Daniel 9:1 Daniel 9:2 ), Daniel and his companions were carried to Babylon, there to be brought up at the court and trained in all the learning of the Chaldeans. After this, in the fifth year of Jehoiakim, a great national fast was appointed ( Jeremiah 36:9 ), during which the king, to show his defiance, cut up the leaves of the book of Jeremiah's prophecies as they were read to him in his winter palace, and threw them into the fire. In the same spirit he rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar ( 2 Kings 24:1 ), who again a second time (B.C. 598) marched against Jerusalem, and put Jehoiachim to death, placing his son Jehoiachin on the throne in his stead. But Jehoiachin's counsellors displeasing Nebuchadnezzar, he again a third time turned his army against Jerusalem, and carried away to Babylon a second detachment of Jews as captives, to the number of 10,000 ( 2 Kings 24:13 ;  Jeremiah 24:1 ;  2 Chr  36:10 ), among whom were the king, with his mother and all his princes and officers, also Ezekiel, who with many of his companions were settled on the banks of the river Chebar (q.v.). He also carried away all the remaining treasures of the temple and the palace, and the golden vessels of the sanctuary.  <p> Mattaniah, the uncle of Jehoiachin, was now made king over what remained of the kingdom of Judah, under the name of Zedekiah ( 2 Kings 24:17 ;  2 Chr  <span class="badLink">36:10</span> ). After a troubled reign of eleven years his kingdom came to an end ( 2 Chronicles 36:11 ). Nebuchadnezzar, with a powerful army, besieged Jerusalem, and Zedekiah became a prisoner in Babylon. His eyes were put out, and he was kept in close confinement till his death ( 2 Kings 25:7 ). The city was spoiled of all that was of value, and then given up to the flames. The temple and palaces were consumed, and the walls of the city were levelled with the ground (B.C. 586), and all that remained of the people, except a number of the poorest class who were left to till the ground and dress the vineyards, were carried away captives to Babylon. This was the third and last deportation of Jewish captives. The land was now utterly desolate, and was abondoned to anarchy.  </p><p> In the first year of his reign as king of Babylon (B.C. 536), Cyrus issued a decree liberating the Jewish captives, and permitting them to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the city and the temple ( 2 Chronicles 36:22 2 Chronicles 36:23 ; Ezra 1; 2). The number of the people forming the first caravan, under Zerubbabel, amounted in all to 42,360 ( Ezra 2:64 Ezra 2:65 ), besides 7,337 men-servants and maid-servants. A considerable number, 12,000 probably, from the ten tribes who had been carried away into Assyria no doubt combined with this band of liberated captives.  </p><p> At a later period other bands of the Jews returned (1) under ( Ezra 7:7 ) (B.C. 458), and (2) ( Nehemiah 7:66 ) (B.C. 445). But the great mass of the people remained still in the land to which they had been carried, and became a portion of the Jews of the "dispersion" ( John 7:35 ;  1 Peter 1:1 ). The whole number of the exiles that chose to remain was probably about six times the number of those who returned.  </p> </li>
Carbuncle	<p>( Exodus 28:17 ;  39:10 ;  Ezekiel 28:13 ). Heb. barkath; LXX. smaragdos; Vulgate, smaragdus; Revised Version, marg., "emerald." The Hebrew word is from a root meaning "to glitter," "lighten," "flash." When held up to the sun, this gem shines like a burning coal, a dark-red glowing coal, and hence is called "carbunculus", i.e., a little coal. It was one of the jewels in the first row of the high priest's breastplate. It has been conjectured by some that the garnet is meant. In  Isaiah 54:12  the Hebrew word is <i> 'ekdah</i> , used in the prophetic description of the glory and beauty of the mansions above. Next to the diamond it is the hardest and most costly of all precious stones. </p>
Carcase	<p>contact with a, made an Israelite ceremonially unclean, and made whatever he touched also unclean, according to the Mosaic law ( Haggai 2:13 ; Compare  Numbers 19:16 Numbers 19:22 ;  Leviticus 11:39 ).  </p>
Carchemish	<p>fortress of Chemosh, a city on the west bank of the Euphrates ( Jeremiah 46:2 ;  2 Chr  35:20 ), not, as was once supposed, the Circesium at the confluence of the Chebar and the Euphrates, but a city considerably higher up the river, and commanding the ordinary passage of the Euphrates; probably identical with Hierapolis. It was the capital of the kingdom of the northern Hittites. The Babylonian army, under Nebuchadnezzar, the son of Nabopolassar, here met and conquered the army of Pharaoh-necho, king of Egypt (B.C. 607). It is mentioned in monuments in B.C. 1600 and down to B.C. 717.  </p>
Carmel	<p>a park; generally with the article, "the park." </p><li> A prominent headland of Central Palestine, consisting of several connected hills extending from the plain of Esdraelon to the sea, a distance of some 12 miles or more. At the east end, in its highest part, it is 1,728 feet high, and at the west end it forms a promontory to the bay of Acre about 600 feet above the sea. It lay within the tribe of Asher. It was here, at the east end of the ridge, at a place called el-Mukhrakah (i.e., the place of burning), that Elijah brought back the people to their allegiance to God, and slew the prophets of Baal ( 1 Kings 18 ). Here were consumed the "fifties" of the royal guard; and here also Elisha received the visit of the bereaved mother whose son was restored by him to life ( 2 Kings 4:25-37 ). "No mountain in or around Palestine retains its ancient beauty so much as Carmel. Two or three villages and some scattered cottages are found on it; its groves are few but luxuriant; it is no place for crags and precipices or rocks of wild goats; but its surface is covered with a rich and constant verdure." "The whole mountain-side is dressed with blossom, and flowering shrubs, and fragrant herbs." The western extremity of the ridge is, however, more rocky and bleak than the eastern. The head of the bride in Cant  7:5  is compared to Carmel. It is ranked with Bashan on account of its rich pastures ( Isaiah 33:9 ;  Jeremiah 50:19 ;  Amos 1:2 ). The whole ridge is deeply furrowed with rocky ravines filled with dense jungle. There are many caves in its sides, which at one time were inhabited by swarms of monks. These caves are referred to in  Amos 9:3 . To them Elijah and Elisha often resorted ( 1 Kings 18:19 1 Kings 18:42 ;  2 Kings  2:25 ). On its north-west summit there is an ancient establishment of Carmelite monks. Vineyards have recently been planted on the mount by the German colonists of Haifa. The modern Arabic name of the mount is Kurmul, but more commonly Jebel Mar Elyas, i.e., Mount St. Elias, from the Convent of Elias.  </li><li> A town in the hill country of Judah ( Joshua 15:55 ), the residence of Nabal ( 1 Samuel 25:2 1 Samuel 25:5 1 Samuel 25:7 1 Samuel 25:40 ), and the native place of Abigail, who became David's wife ( 1 Samuel 27:3 ). Here king Uzziah had his vineyards ( 2 Chronicles 26:10 ). The ruins of this town still remain under the name of Kurmul, about 10 miles south-south-east of Hebron, close to those of Maon.   </li>
Carmi	<p>vine-dresser. </p><li> The last named of the four sons of Reuben ( Genesis 46:9 ).  </li><li> A descendant of Judah ( 1 Chronicles 4:1 ). He is elsewhere ( 2:18 ) called Caleb (q.v.).  </li><li> The son of Zimri, and the father of Achan ( Joshua 7:1 ), "the troubler of Israel."   </li>
Carnal	<p>Unconverted men are so called ( 1 Corinthians 3:3 ). They are represented as of a "carnal mind, which is enmity against God" ( Romans 8:6 Romans 8:7 ). Enjoyments that minister to the wants and desires of man's animal nature are so called ( Romans 15:27 ;  1 Corinthians 9:11 ). The ceremonial of the Mosaic law is spoken of as "carnal," because it related to things outward, the bodies of men and of animals, and the purification of the flesh ( Hebrews 7:16 ;  9:10 ). The weapons of Christian warfare are "not carnal", that is, they are not of man's device, nor are wielded by human power ( 2 Corinthians 10:4 ).  </p>
Carpenter	<p>an artificer in stone, iron, and copper, as well as in wood ( 2 Samuel 5:11 ;  1 Chronicles 14:1 ;  Mark 6:3 ). The tools used by carpenters are mentioned in  1 Samuel 13:19 1 Samuel 13:20 ;  Judges 4:21 ;  Isaiah 10:15 ;  44:13 . It was said of our Lord, "Is not this the carpenter's son?" ( Matthew 13:55 ); also, "Is not this the carpenter?" ( Mark 6:3 ). Every Jew, even the rabbis, learned some handicraft: Paul was a tentmaker. "In the cities the carpenters would be Greeks, and skilled workmen; the carpenter of a provincial village could only have held a very humble position, and secured a very moderate competence."  </p>
Carriage	<p>In the Authorized Version this word is found as the rendering of many different words. In  Judges 18:21  it means valuables, wealth, or booty. In  Isaiah 46:1  (RSV, "the things that ye carried about") the word means a load for a beast of burden. In  1 Samuel 17:22  and  Isaiah 10:28  it is the rendering of a word ("stuff" in  1 Samuel 10:22 ) meaning implements, equipments, baggage. The phrase in  Acts 21:15 , "We took up our carriages," means properly, "We packed up our baggage," as in the Revised Version.  </p>
Cart	<p>a vehicle moving on wheels, and usually drawn by oxen ( 2 Samuel 6:3 ). The Hebrew word thus rendered, <i> 'agalah</i> ( 1 Samuel 6:7 1 Samuel 6:8 ), is also rendered "wagon" ( Genesis 45:19 ). It is used also to denote a war-chariot ( Psalms 46:9 ). Carts were used for the removal of the ark and its sacred utensils ( Numbers 7:3 Numbers 7:6 ). After retaining the ark amongst them for seven months, the Philistines sent it back to the Israelites. On this occasion they set it in a new cart, probably a rude construction, with solid wooden wheels like that still used in Western Asia, which was drawn by two milch cows, which conveyed it straight to Beth-shemesh.  </p><p> A "cart rope," for the purpose of fastening loads on carts, is used ( Isaiah 5:18 ) as a symbol of the power of sinful pleasures or habits over him who indulges them. (See CORD .) In Syria and Palestine wheel-carriages for any other purpose than the conveyance of agricultural produce are almost unknown. </p>
Carve	<p>The arts of engraving and carving were much practised among the Jews. They were practised in connection with the construction of the tabernacle and the temple ( Exodus 31:2 Exodus 31:5 ;  35:33 ;  1 Kings 6:18 1 Kings 6:35 ;  Psalms 74:6 ), as well as in the ornamentation of the priestly dresses ( Exodus 28:9-36 ;  Zechariah 3:9 ;  2 Chr  Zechariah 2:7  Zechariah 2:14 ). ( Isaiah 44:13-17 ) gives a minute description of the process of carving idols of wood.  </p>
Casement	<p>a barrier of open-work placed before windows ( Proverbs 7:6 ). In  Judges 5:28  the Hebrew word is rendered "lattice," in the LXX. "network," an opening through which cool air is admitted.  </p>
Casiphia	<p>silver, a place between Babylon and Jerusalem, where Iddo resided ( Ezra 8:17 ); otherwise unknown.  </p>
Casluhim	<p>fortified, a people descended from Mizraim ( Genesis 10:14 ;  1 Chronicles 1:12 ). Their original seat was probably somewhere in Lower Egypt, along the sea-coast to the south border of Palestine.  </p>
Cassia	<p></p><li> Hebrew <i> kiddah'</i> , i.e., "split." One of the principal spices of the holy anointing oil ( Exodus 30:24 ), and an article of commerce ( Ezekiel 27:19 ). It is the inner bark of a tree resembling the cinnamon (q.v.), the Cinnamomum cassia of botanists, and was probably imported from India.  </li><li> Hebrew pl. <i> ketzi'oth</i> ( Psalms 45:8 ). Mentioned in connection with myrrh and aloes as being used to scent garments. It was probably prepared from the peeled bark, as the Hebrew word suggests, of some kind of cinnamon.   </li>
Castaway	<p>Gr. adokimos, ( 1 Corinthians 9:27 ), one regarded as unworthy (RSV, "rejected"); elsewhere rendered "reprobate" ( 2 Timothy 3:8 , etc.); "rejected" ( Hebrews 6:8 , etc.).  </p>
Castle	<p>a military fortress ( 1 Chronicles 11:7 ), also probably a kind of tower used by the priests for making known anything discovered at a distance ( 1 Chronicles 6:54 ). Castles are also mentioned ( Genesis 25:16 ) as a kind of watch-tower, from which shepherds kept watch over their flocks by night. The "castle" into which the chief captain commanded Paul to be brought was the quarters of the Roman soldiers in the fortress of Antonia (so called by Herod after his patron Mark Antony), which was close to the north-west corner of the temple ( Acts 21:34 ), which it commanded.  </p>
Castor and Pollux	<p>the "Dioscuri", two heroes of Greek and Roman mythology. Their figures were probably painted or sculptured on the prow of the ship which Luke refers to ( Acts 28:11 ). They were regarded as the tutelary divinities of sailors. They appeared in the heavens as the constellation Gemini.  </p>
Caterpillar	<p>the consumer. Used in the Old Testament ( 1 Kings 8:37 ;  2 Chr.  6:28 ;  Psalms 78:46 ;  Isaiah 33:4 ) as the translation of a word (hasil) the root of which means "to devour" or "consume," and which is used also with reference to the locust in  Deuteronomy 28:38 . It may have been a species of locust, or the name of one of the transformations through which the locust passes, locust-grub. It is also found ( Psalms 105:34 ;  Jeremiah 51:14 Jeremiah 51:27 ; RSV, "cankerworm") as the rendering of a different Hebrew word, <i> yelek</i> , a word elsewhere rendered "cankerworm" (q.v.),  Joel 1:4 ;  2:25 . (See LOCUST .) </p>
Catholic epistles	<p>the epistles of James, Peter, John, and Jude; so called because they are addressed to Christians in general, and not to any church or person in particular. </p>
Cattle	<p>abounded in the Holy Land. To the rearing and management of them the inhabitants chiefly devoted themselves ( Deuteronomy 8:13 ;  12:21 ;  1 Samuel 11:5 ;  12:3 ;  Psalms 144:14 ;  Jeremiah 3:24 ). They may be classified as,  </p><li> Neat cattle. Many hundreds of these were yearly consumed in sacrifices or used for food. The finest herds were found in Bashan, beyond Jordan ( Numbers 32:4 ). Large herds also pastured on the wide fertile plains of Sharon. They were yoked to the plough ( 1 Kings 19:19 ), and were employed for carrying burdens ( 1 Chronicles 12:40 ). They were driven with a pointed rod ( Judges 3:31 ) or goad (q.v.).  <p> According to the Mosaic law, the mouths of cattle employed for the threshing-floor were not to be muzzled, so as to prevent them from eating of the provender over which they trampled ( Deuteronomy 25:4 ). Whosoever stole and sold or slaughtered an ox must give five in satisfaction ( Exodus 22:1 ); but if it was found alive in the possession of him who stole it, he was required to make double restitution only ( 22:4 ). If an ox went astray, whoever found it was required to bring it back to its owner ( 23:4 ;  Deuteronomy 22:1 Deuteronomy 22:4 ). An ox and an ass could not be yoked together in the plough ( Deuteronomy 22:10 ).  </p></li><li> Small cattle. Next to herds of neat cattle, sheep formed the most important of the possessions of the inhabitants of Palestine ( Genesis 12:16 ;  13:5 ;  26:14 ;  21:27 ;  Genesis 29:2 Genesis 29:3 ). They are frequently mentioned among the booty taken in war ( Numbers 31:32 ;  Joshua 6:21 ;  1 Samuel 14:32 ;  15:3 ). There were many who were owners of large flocks ( 1 Samuel 25:2 ;  2 Sam  12:2 , Compare  Job 1:3 ). Kings also had shepherds "over their flocks" ( 1 Chronicles 27:31 ), from which they derived a large portion of their revenue ( 2 Samuel 17:29 ;  1 Chronicles 12:40 ). The districts most famous for their flocks of sheep were the plain of Sharon ( Isaiah 65: :  10 ), Mount Carmel ( Micah 7:14 ), Bashan and Gilead ( Micah 7:14 ). In patriarchal times the flocks of sheep were sometimes tended by the daughters of the owners. Thus Rachel, the daughter of Laban, kept her father's sheep ( Genesis 29:9 ); as also Zipporah and her six sisters had charge of their father Jethro's flocks ( Exodus 2:16 ). Sometimes they were kept by hired shepherds ( John 10:12 ), and sometimes by the sons of the family ( 1 Samuel 16:11 ;  17:15 ). The keepers so familiarized their sheep with their voices that they knew them, and followed them at their call. Sheep, but more especially rams and lambs, were frequently offered in sacrifice. The shearing of sheep was a great festive occasion ( 1 Samuel 25:4 ;  2 Sam  13:23 ). They were folded at night, and guarded by their keepers against the attacks of the lion ( Micah 5:8 ), the bear ( 1 Samuel 17:34 ), and the wolf ( Matthew 10:16 ;  John 10:12 ). They were liable to wander over the wide pastures and go astray ( Psalms 119:176 ;  Isaiah 53:6 ;  Hosea 4:16 ;  Matthew 18:12 ).  <p> Goats also formed a part of the pastoral wealth of Palestine ( Genesis 15:9 ;  32:14 ;  37:31 ). They were used both for sacrifice and for food ( Deuteronomy 14:4 ), especially the young males ( Genesis 27:9 Genesis 27:14 Genesis 27:17 ;  Judges 6:19 ;  13:15 ;  1 Samuel 16:20 ). Goat's hair was used for making tent cloth ( Exodus 26:7 ;  36:14 ), and for mattresses and bedding ( 1 Samuel 19:13 1 Samuel 19:16 ). (See GOAT .) </p> </li>
Caul	<p>(Heb. yothe'reth; i.e., "something redundant"), the membrane which covers the upper part of the liver ( Exodus 29:13 Exodus 29:22 ;  Leviticus 3:4 Leviticus 3:10 Leviticus 3:15 ;  4:9 ;  7:4 ; marg., "midriff"). In  Hosea 13:8  (Heb. seghor; i.e., "an enclosure") the pericardium, or parts about the heart, is meant.  </p>
Cauls	<p>In  Isaiah 3:18  this word (Heb. shebisim), in the marg. "networks," denotes network caps to contain the hair, worn by females. Others explain it as meaning "wreaths worn round the forehead, reaching from one ear to the other."  </p>
Causeway	<p>a raised way, an ascent by steps, or a raised slope between Zion and the temple ( 1 Chronicles 26:16 1 Chronicles 26:18 ). In  2 Chronicles 9:11  the same word is translated "terrace."  </p>
Cave	<p>There are numerous natural caves among the limestone rocks of Syria, many of which have been artificially enlarged for various purposes. </p><p> The first notice of a cave occurs in the history of Lot ( Genesis 19:30 ).  </p><p> The next we read of is the cave of Machpelah (q.v.), which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth ( Genesis 25:9 Genesis 25:10 ). It was the burying-place of Sarah and of Abraham himself, also of Isaac, Rebekah, Leah, and Jacob ( Genesis 49:31 ;  50:13 ).  </p><p> The cave of Makkedah, into which the five Amorite kings retired after their defeat by ( Joshua 10:16 Joshua 10:27 ).  </p><p> The cave of Adullam (q.v.), an immense natural cavern, where David hid himself from Saul ( 1 Samuel 22:1 1 Samuel 22:2 ).  </p><p> The cave of Engedi (q.v.), now called 'Ain Jidy, i.e., the "Fountain of the Kid", where David cut off the skirt of Saul's robe ( 24:4 ). Here he also found a shelter for himself and his followers to the number of 600 ( 23:29 ;  24:1 ). "On all sides the country is full of caverns which might serve as lurking-places for David and his men, as they do for outlaws at the present day."  </p><p> The cave in which Obadiah hid the prophets ( 1 Kings 18:4 ) was probably in the north, but it cannot be identified.  </p><p> The cave of Elijah ( 1 Kings 19:9 ), and the "cleft" of Moses on Horeb ( Exodus 33:22 ), cannot be determined.  </p><p> In the time of Gideon the Israelites took refuge from the Midianites in dens and caves, such as abounded in the mountain regions of Manasseh ( Judges 6:2 ).  </p><p> Caves were frequently used as dwelling-places ( Numbers 24:21 ; Cant  2:14 ;  Jeremiah 49:16 ;  Obadiah 1:3 ). "The excavations at Deir Dubban, on the south side of the wady leading to Santa Hanneh, are probably the dwellings of the Horites," the ancient inhabitants of Idumea Proper. The pits or cavities in rocks were also sometimes used as prisons ( Isaiah 24:22 ;  51:14 ;  Zechariah 9:11 ). Those which had niches in their sides were occupied as burying-places ( Ezekiel 32:23 ;  John 11:38 ).  </p>
Cedar	<p>(Heb. e'rez, Gr. kedros, Lat. cedrus), a tree very frequently mentioned in Scripture. It was stately ( Ezekiel 31:3-5 ), long-branched ( Psalms 80:10 ;  92:12 ;  Ezekiel 31:6-9 ), odoriferous (Cant  4:11 ;  Hosea 14:6 ), durable, and therefore much used for boards, pillars, and ceilings ( 1 Kings 6:9 1 Kings 6:10 ;  7:2 ;  Jeremiah 22:14 ), for masts ( Ezekiel 27:5 ), and for carved images ( Isaiah 44:14 ).  </p><p> It grew very abundantly in Palestine, and particularly on Lebanon, of which it was "the glory" ( Isaiah 35:2 ;  60:13 ). Hiram supplied Solomon with cedar trees from Lebanon for various purposes connected with the construction of the temple and the king's palace ( 2 Samuel 5:11 ;  2 Samuel 7:2 2 Samuel 7:7 ;  1 Kings 5:6 1 Kings 5:8 1 Kings 5:10 ;  1 Kings 6:9 1 Kings 6:10 1 Kings 6:15 1 Kings 6:16 1 Kings 6:18 1 Kings 6:20 ;  1 Kings 7:2 1 Kings 7:3 1 Kings 7:7 1 Kings 7:11 1 Kings 7:12 ;  9:11 , etc.). Cedars were used also in the building of the second temple under Zerubbabel ( Ezra 3:7 ).  </p><p> Of the ancient cedars of Lebanon there remain now only some seven or eight. They are not standing together. But beside them there are found between three hundred and four hundred of younger growth. They stand in an amphitheatre fronting the west, about 6,400 feet above the level of the sea.  </p><p> The cedar is often figuratively alluded to in the sacred Scriptures. "The mighty conquerors of olden days, the despots of Assyria and the Pharaohs of Egypt, the proud and idolatrous monarchs of Judah, the Hebrew commonwealth itself, the war-like Ammonites of patriarchal times, and the moral majesty of the Messianic age, are all compared to the towering cedar, in its royal loftiness and supremacy ( Isaiah 2:13 ;  Ezekiel 17:3 Ezekiel 17:22 Ezekiel 17:23 Ezekiel 31:3-9 ;  Amos 2:9 ;  Zechariah 11:1 Zechariah 11:2 ;  Job 40:17 ;  Psalms 29:5 ;  80:10 ;  92:12 , etc).", Groser's Scrip. Nat. Hist. (See BOX-TREE.)  </p>
Cedron	<p>the black torrent, the brook flowing through the ravine below the eastern wall of Jerusalem ( John 18:1 ). (See KIDRON .) </p>
Ceiling	<p>the covering ( 1 Kings 7:3 1 Kings 7:7 ) of the inside roof and walls of a house with planks of wood ( 2 Chronicles 3:5 ;  Jeremiah 22:14 ). Ceilings were sometimes adorned with various ornaments in stucco, gold, silver, gems, and ivory. The ceilings of the temple and of Solomon's palace are described  1 Kings 6:9 1 Kings 6:15 ;  7:3 ;  2 Chr.  1 Kings 3:5 1 Kings 3:9 .  </p>
Cellar	<p>a subterranean vault ( 1 Chronicles 27:28 ), a storehouse. The word is also used to denote the treasury of the temple ( 1 Kings 7:51 ) and of the king ( 14:26 ). The Hebrew word is rendered "garner" in  Joel 1:17 , and "armoury" in  Jeremiah 50:25 .  </p>
Cenchrea	<p>millet, the eastern harbour of Corinth, from which it was distant about 9 miles east, and the outlet for its trade with the Asiatic shores of the Mediterranean. When Paul returned from his second missionary journey to Syria, he sailed from this port ( Acts 18:18 ). In  Romans 16:1  he speaks as if there were at the time of his writing that epistle an organized church there. The western harbour of Corinth was Lechaeum, about a mile and a half from the city. It was the channel of its trade with Italy and the west.  </p>
Censer	<p>the vessel in which incense was presented on "the golden altar" before the Lord in the temple ( Exodus 30:1-9 ). The priest filled the censer with live coal from the sacred fire on the altar of burnt-offering, and having carried it into the sanctuary, there threw upon the burning coals the sweet incense ( Leviticus 16:12 Leviticus 16:13 ), which sent up a cloud of smoke, filling the apartment with fragrance. The censers in daily use were of brass ( Numbers 16:39 ), and were designated by a different Hebrew name, <i> miktereth</i> ( 2 Chronicles 26:19 ;  Ezekiel 8:11 ): while those used on the day of Atonement were of gold, and were denoted by a word (mahtah) meaning "something to take fire with;" LXX. pureion = a fire-pan. Solomon prepared for the temple censers of pure gold ( 1 Kings 7:50 ;  2 Chr  4:22 ). The angel in the Apocalypse is represented with a golden censer ( Revelation 8:3 Revelation 8:5 ). Paul speaks of the golden censer as belonging to the tabernacle ( Hebrews 9:4 ). The Greek word thumiaterion, here rendered "censer," may more appropriately denote, as in the margin of Revised Version, "the altar of incense." Paul does not here say that the thumiaterion was in the holiest, for it was in the holy place, but that the holiest had it, i.e., that it belonged to the holiest ( 1 Kings 6:22 ). It was intimately connected with the high priest's service in the holiest.  </p><p> The manner in which the censer is to be used is described in  Numbers 4:14 ;  Leviticus 16:12 .  </p>
Census	<p>There are five instances of a census of the Jewish people having been taken. </p><li> In the fourth month after the Exodus, when the people were encamped at Sinai. The number of men from twenty years old and upward was then 603,550 ( Exodus 38:26 ). </li><li> Another census was made just before the entrance into Canaan, when the number was found to be 601,730, showing thus a small decrease ( Numbers 26:51 ). </li><li> The next census was in the time of David, when the number, exclusive of the tribes of Levi and Benjamin, was found to be 1,300,000 ( 2 Samuel 24:9 ;  1 Chronicles 21:5 ). </li><li> Solomon made a census of the foreigners in the land, and found 153,600 able-bodied workmen ( 2 Chronicles 2:17 2 Chronicles 2:18 ). </li><li> After the return from Exile the whole congregation of Israel was numbered, and found to amount to 42,360 ( Ezra 2:64 ). A census was made by the Roman government in the time of our Lord ( Luke 2:1 ). (See TAXING .)  </li>
Centurion	<p>a Roman officer in command of a hundred men ( Mark 15:39 Mark 15:44 Mark 15:45 ). Cornelius, the first Gentile convert, was a centurion ( Acts 10:1 Acts 10:22 ). Other centurions are mentioned in  Matthew 8:5 Matthew 8:8 Matthew 8:13 ;  Luke 7:2 Luke 7:6 ;  Acts 21:32 ;  Acts 22:25 Acts 22:26 ;  Acts 23:17 Acts 23:23 ;  24:23 ;  Acts 27:1 Acts 27:6 Acts 27:11 Acts 27:31 Acts 27:43 ;  28:16 . A centurion watched the crucifixion of our Lord ( Matthew 27:54 ;  Luke 23:47 ), and when he saw the wonders attending it, exclaimed, "Truly this man was the Son of God." "The centurions mentioned in the New Testament are uniformly spoken of in terms of praise, whether in the Gospels or in the Acts. It is interesting to compare this with the statement of Polybius (vi. 24), that the centurions were chosen by merit, and so were men remarkable not so much for their daring courage as for their deliberation, constancy, and strength of mind.", Dr. Maclear's N. T. Hist.  </p>
Cephas	<p>a Syriac surname given by Christ to Simon ( John 1:42 ), meaning "rock." The Greeks translated it by Petros, and the Latins by Petrus.  </p>
Cesarea	<p>See CAESAREA . </p>
Chaff	<p>the refuse of winnowed corn. It was usually burned ( Exodus 15:7 ;  Isaiah 5:24 ;  Matthew 3:12 ). This word sometimes, however, means dried grass or hay ( Isaiah 5:24 ;  33:11 ). Chaff is used as a figure of abortive wickedness ( Psalms 1:4 ;  Matthew 3:12 ). False doctrines are also called chaff ( Jeremiah 23:28 ), or more correctly rendered "chopped straw." The destruction of the wicked, and their powerlessness, are likened to the carrying away of chaff by the wind ( Isaiah 17:13 ;  Hosea 13:3 ;  Zephaniah 2:2 ).  </p>
Chain	<p></p><li> A part of the insignia of office. A chain of gold was placed about Joseph's neck ( Genesis 41:42 ); and one was promised to ( Daniel 5:7 ). It is used as a symbol of sovereignty (Ezek.  16:11 ). The breast-plate of the high-priest was fastened to the ephod by golden chains ( Exodus 39:17 Exodus 39:21 ).  </li><li> It was used as an ornament ( Proverbs 1:9 ; Cant  1:10 ). The Midianites adorned the necks of their camels with chains (Judg.  Proverbs 8:21 Proverbs 8:26 ).  </li><li> Chains were also used as fetters wherewith prisoners were bound ( Judges 16:21 ;  2 Sam  3:34 ;  2 Kings  25:7 ;  Jeremiah 39:7 ). Paul was in this manner bound to a Roman soldier ( Acts 28:20 ;  Ephesians 6:20 ;  2 Tim  1:16 ). Sometimes, for the sake of greater security, the prisoner was attached by two chains to two soldiers, as in the case of Peter ( Acts 12:6 ).   </li>
Chalcedony	<p>Mentioned only in  Revelation 21:19 , as one of the precious stones in the foundation of the New Jerusalem. The name of this stone is derived from Chalcedon, where it is said to have been first discovered. In modern mineralogy this is the name of an agate-like quartz of a bluish colour. Pliny so names the Indian ruby. The mineral intended in Revelation is probably the Hebrew <i> nophekh</i> , translated "emerald" ( Exodus 28:18 ;  39:11 ;  Ezekiel 27:16 ;  28:13 ). It is rendered "anthrax" in the LXX., and "carbunculus" in the Vulgate. (See CARBUNCLE .) </p>
Chaldea	<p>The southern portion of Babylonia, Lower Mesopotamia, lying chiefly on the right bank of the Euphrates, but commonly used of the whole of the Mesopotamian plain. The Hebrew name is Kasdim, which is usually rendered "Chaldeans" ( Jeremiah 50:10 ;  Jeremiah 51:24 Jeremiah 51:35 ).  </p><p> The country so named is a vast plain formed by the deposits of the Euphrates and the Tigris, extending to about 400 miles along the course of these rivers, and about 100 miles in average breadth. "In former days the vast plains of Babylon were nourished by a complicated system of canals and water-courses, which spread over the surface of the country like a network. The wants of a teeming population were supplied by a rich soil, not less bountiful than that on the banks of the Egyptian Nile. Like islands rising from a golden sea of waving corn stood frequent groves of palm-trees and pleasant gardens, affording to the idler or traveller their grateful and highly-valued shade. Crowds of passengers hurried along the dusty roads to and from the busy city. The land was rich in corn and wine."  </p><p> Recent discoveries, more especially in Babylonia, have thrown much light on the history of the Hebrew patriarchs, and have illustrated or confirmed the Biblical narrative in many points. The ancestor of the Hebrew people, Abram, was, we are told, born at "Ur of the Chaldees." "Chaldees" is a mistranslation of the Hebrew <i> Kasdim</i> , Kasdim being the Old Testament name of the Babylonians, while the Chaldees were a tribe who lived on the shores of the Persian Gulf, and did not become a part of the Babylonian population till the time of Hezekiah. Ur was one of the oldest and most famous of the Babylonian cities. Its site is now called Mugheir, or Mugayyar, on the western bank of the Euphrates, in Southern Babylonia. About a century before the birth of Abram it was ruled by a powerful dynasty of kings. Their conquests extended to Elam on the one side, and to the Lebanon on the other. They were followed by a dynasty of princes whose capital was Babylon, and who seem to have been of South Arabian origin. The founder of the dynasty was Sumu-abi ("Shem is my father"). But soon afterwards Babylonia fell under Elamite dominion. The kings of Babylon were compelled to acknowledge the supremacy of Elam, and a rival kingdom to that of Babylon, and governed by Elamites, sprang up at Larsa, not far from Ur, but on the opposite bank of the river. In the time of Abram the king of Larsa was Eri-Aku, the son of an Elamite prince, and Eri-Aku, as has long been recognized, is the Biblical "Arioch king of Ellasar" ( Genesis 14:1 ). The contemporaneous king of Babylon in the north, in the country termed Shinar in Scripture, was Khammu-rabi. (See BABYLON; ABRAHAM;  AMRAPHEL .) </p>
Chaldee language	<p>employed by the sacred writers in certain portions of the Old Testament, viz.,  Daniel 2:4-7 Daniel 2:28 ;  Ezra 4:8-6:18; ;  7:12-26 ;  Genesis 31:46 ;  Jeremiah 10:11 . It is the Aramaic dialect, as it is sometimes called, as distinguished from the Hebrew dialect. It was the language of commerce and of social intercourse in Western Asia, and after the Exile gradually came to be the popular language of Palestine. It is called "Syrian" in  2 Kings 18:26 . Some isolated words in this language are preserved in the New Testament ( Matthew 5:22 ;  6:24 ;  16:17 ;  27:46 ;  Mark 3:17 ;  5:41 ;  7:34 ;  14:36 ;  Acts 1:19 ;  1 Corinthians 16:22 ). These are specimens of the vernacular language of Palestine at that period. The term "Hebrew" was also sometimes applied to the Chaldee because it had become the language of the Hebrews ( John 5:2 ;  19:20 ).  </p>
Chaldees	<p>or Chaldeans, the inhabitants of the country of which Babylon was the capital. They were so called till the time of the Captivity ( 2 Kings 25 ;  Isaiah 13:19 ;  23:13 ), when, particularly in the Book of ( Daniel 5:30 ;  9:1 ), the name began to be used with special reference to a class of learned men ranked with the magicians and astronomers. These men cultivated the ancient Cushite language of the original inhabitants of the land, for they had a "learning" and a "tongue" ( 1:4 ) of their own. The common language of the country at that time had become assimilated to the Semitic dialect, especially through the influence of the Assyrians, and was the language that was used for all civil purposes. The Chaldeans were the learned class, interesting themselves in science and religion, which consisted, like that of the ancient Arabians and Syrians, in the worship of the heavenly bodies. There are representations of this priestly class, of magi and diviners, on the walls of the Assyrian palaces.  </p>
Chamber	<p>"on the wall," which the Shunammite prepared for the prophet Elisha ( 2 Kings 4:10 ), was an upper chamber over the porch through the hall toward the street. This was the "guest chamber" where entertainments were prepared ( Mark 14:14 ). There were also "chambers within chambers" ( 1 Kings 22:25 ;  2 Kings  9:2 ). To enter into a chamber is used metaphorically of prayer and communion with God ( Isaiah 26:20 ). The "chambers of the south" ( Job 9:9 ) are probably the constelations of the southern hemisphere. The "chambers of imagery", i.e., chambers painted with images, as used by ( Ezekiel 8:12 ), is an expression denoting the vision the prophet had of the abominations practised by the Jews in Jerusalem.  </p>
Chambering	<p>( Romans 13:13 ), wantonness, impurity.  </p>
Chamberlain	<p>a confidential servant of the king ( Genesis 37:36 ;  39:1 ). In  Romans 16:23  mention is made of "Erastus the chamberlain." Here the word denotes the treasurer of the city, or the quaestor, as the Romans styled him. He is almost the only convert from the higher ranks of whom mention is made (Compare  Acts 17:34 ). Blastus, Herod's "chamberlain" ( Acts 12:20 ), was his personal attendant or valet-de-chambre. The Hebrew word <i> saris</i> , thus translated in  Esther 1:10 Esther 1:15 ;  Esther 2:3 Esther 2:14 Esther 2:21 , etc., properly means an eunuch (as in the marg.), as it is rendered in  Isaiah 39:7 ;  56:3 .  </p>
Chameleon	<p>a species of lizard which has the faculty of changing the colour of its skin. It is ranked among the unclean animals in  Leviticus 11:30 , where the Hebrew word so translated is <i> coah</i> (RSV, "land crocodile"). In the same verse the Hebrew <i> tanshemeth</i> , rendered in Authorized Version "mole," is in Revised Version "chameleon," which is the correct rendering. This animal is very common in Egypt and in the Holy Land, especially in the Jordan valley. </p>
Chamois	<p>only in  Deuteronomy 14:5  (Heb. zemer), an animal of the deer or gazelle species. It bears this Hebrew name from its leaping or springing. The animal intended is probably the wild sheep (Ovis tragelephus), which is still found in Sinai and in the broken ridges of Stony Arabia. The LXX. and Vulgate render the word by camelopardus, i.e., the giraffe; but this is an animal of Central Africa, and is not at all known in Syria.  </p>
Champion	<p>( 1 Samuel 17:4 1 Samuel 17:23 ), properly "the man between the two," denoting the position of Goliath between the two camps. Single combats of this kind at the head of armies were common in ancient times. In ver. 51 this word is the rendering of a different Hebrew word, and properly denotes "a mighty man."  </p>
Chance	<p>( Luke 10:31 ). "It was not by chance that the priest came down by that road at that time, but by a specific arrangement and in exact fulfilment of a plan; not the plan of the priest, nor the plan of the wounded traveller, but the plan of God. By coincidence (Gr. sungkuria) the priest came down, that is, by the conjunction of two things, in fact, which were previously constituted a pair in the providence of God. In the result they fell together according to the omniscient Designer's plan. This is the true theory of the divine government." Compare the meeting of Philip with the Ethiopian ( Acts 8:26 Acts 8:27 ). There is no "chance" in God's empire. "Chance" is only another word for our want of knowledge as to the way in which one event falls in with another ( 1 Samuel 6:9 ; Eccl  9:11 ).  </p>
Chancellor	<p>one who has judicial authority, literally, a "lord of judgement;" a title given to the Persian governor of Samaria ( Ezra 4:8 Ezra 4:9 Ezra 4:17 ).  </p>
Changes of raiment	<p>were reckoned among the treasures of rich men ( Genesis 45:22 ; Judg.  Genesis 14:12 Genesis 14:13 ;  2 Kings  Genesis 5:22 Genesis 5:23 ).  </p>
Channel	<p></p><li> The bed of the sea or of a river ( Psalms 18:15 ;  Isaiah 8:7 ).  </li><li> The "chanelbone" ( Job 31:22  marg.), properly "tube" or "shaft," an old term for the collar-bone.   </li>
Chapel	<p>a holy place or sanctuary, occurs only in  Amos 7:13 , where one of the idol priests calls Bethel "the king's chapel."  </p>
Chapiter	<p>the ornamental head or capital of a pillar. Three Hebrew words are so rendered. </p><li> <i> Cothereth</i> ( 1 Kings 7:16 ;  2 Kings  25:17 ;  2 Chr  4:12 ), meaning a "diadem" or "crown." </li><li> <i> Tzepheth</i> ( 2 Chronicles 3:15 ). </li><li> <i> Rosh</i> ( Exodus 36:38 ;  Exodus 38:17 Exodus 38:19 Exodus 38:28 ), properly a "head" or "top."   </li>
Chapter	<p>The several books of the Old and New Testaments were from an early time divided into chapters. The Pentateuch was divided by the ancient Hebrews into 54 <i> parshioth</i> or sections, one of which was read in the synagogue every Sabbath day ( Acts 13:15 ). These sections were afterwards divided into 669 <i> sidrim</i> or orders of unequal length. The Prophets were divided in somewhat the same manner into <i> haphtaroth</i> or passages. </p><p> In the early Latin and Greek versions of the Bible, similar divisions of the several books were made. The New Testament books were also divided into portions of various lengths under different names, such as titles and heads or chapters. </p><p> In modern times this ancient example was imitated, and many attempts of the kind were made before the existing division into chapters was fixed. The Latin Bible published by Cardinal Hugo of St. Cher in A.D. 1240 is generally regarded as the first Bible that was divided into our present chapters, although it appears that some of the chapters were fixed as early as A.D. 1059. This division into chapters came gradually to be adopted in the published editions of the Hebrew, with some few variations, and of the Greek Scriptures, and hence of other versions.  </p>
Charashim	<p>craftsmen, a valley named in  1 Chronicles 4:14 . In  Nehemiah 11:35  the Hebrew word is rendered "valley of craftsmen" (RSV marg., Geha-rashim). Nothing is known of it.  </p>
Charger	<p>a bowl or deep dish. The silver vessels given by the heads of the tribes for the services of the tabernacle are so named ( Numbers 7:13 , etc.). The "charger" in which the Baptist's head was presented was a platter or flat wooden trencher ( Matthew 14:8 Matthew 14:11 ;  Mark 6:25 Mark 6:28 ). The chargers of gold and silver of  Ezra 1:9  were probably basins for receiving the blood of sacrifices.  </p>
Chariot	<p>a vehicle generally used for warlike purposes. Sometimes, though but rarely, it is spoken of as used for peaceful purposes. </p><p> The first mention of the chariot is when Joseph, as a mark of distinction, was placed in Pharaoh's second state chariot ( Genesis 41:43 ); and the next, when he went out in his own chariot to meet his father Jacob ( 46:29 ). Chariots formed part of the funeral procession of Jacob ( 50:9 ). When Pharaoh pursued the Israelites he took 600 war-chariots with him ( Exodus 14:7 ). The Canaanites in the valleys of Palestine had chariots of iron ( Joshua 17:18 ;  Judges 1:19 ). Jabin, the king of Canaan, had 900 chariots ( Judges 4:3 ); and in Saul's time the Philistines had 30,000. In his wars with the king of Zobah and with the Syrians, David took many chariots among the spoils ( 2 Samuel 8:4 ;  10:18 ). Solomon maintained as part of his army 1,400 chariots ( 1 Kings 10:26 ), which were chiefly imported from Egypt (29). From this time forward they formed part of the armies of Israel ( 1 Kings 22:34 ;  2 Kings  1 Kings 9:16 1 Kings 9:21 ;  1 Kings 13:7 1 Kings 13:14 ;  18:24 ;  <span class="badLink">23:30</span> ).  </p><p> In the New Testament we have only one historical reference to the use of chariots, in the case of the Ethiopian eunuch ( Acts 8:28 Acts 8:29 Acts 8:38 ).  </p><p> This word is sometimes used figuratively for hosts ( Psalms 68:17 ;  2 Kings  <span class="badLink">6:17</span> ). Elijah, by his prayers and his counsel, was "the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof." The rapid agency of God in the phenomena of nature is also spoken of under the similitude of a chariot ( Psalms 104:3 ;  Isaiah 66:15 ;  Habakkuk 3:8 ).  </p><p> Chariot of the cherubim ( 1 Chronicles 28:18 ), the chariot formed by the two cherubs on the mercy-seat on which the Lord rides.  </p><p> Chariot cities were set apart for storing the war-chariots in time of peace ( 2 Chronicles 1:14 ).  </p><p> Chariot horses were such as were peculiarly fitted for service in chariots ( 2 Kings 7:14 ).  </p><p> Chariots of war are described in  Exodus 14:7 ;  1 Samuel 13:5 ;  2 Sam.  8:4 ;  1 Chronicles 18:4 ;  Joshua 11:4 ;  Judges 4:3 Judges 4:13 . They were not used by the Israelites till the time of David. Elijah was translated in a "chariot of fire" ( 2 Kings 2:11 ). Compare  2 Kings 6:17 . This vision would be to Elisha a source of strength and encouragement, for now he could say, "They that be with us are more than they that be with them."  </p>
Charity	<p>( 1 Corinthians 13 ), the rendering in the Authorized Version of the word which properly denotes love, and is frequently so rendered (always so in the Revised Version). It is spoken of as the greatest of the three Christian graces ( 1 Corinthians 12:31-13:13). ).  </p>
Charmer	<p>one who practises serpent-charming ( Psalms 58:5 ;  Jeremiah 8:17 ; Eccl.  10:11 ). It was an early and universal opinion that the most venomous reptiles could be made harmless by certain charms or by sweet sounds. It is well known that there are jugglers in India and in other Eastern lands who practise this art at the present day.  </p><p> In  Isaiah 19:3  the word "charmers" is the rendering of the Hebrew <i> 'ittim</i> , meaning, properly, necromancers (RSV marg., "whisperers"). In  Deuteronomy 18:11  the word "charmer" means a dealer in spells, especially one who, by binding certain knots, was supposed thereby to bind a curse or a blessing on its object. In  Isaiah 3:3  the words "eloquent orator" should be, as in the Revised Version, "skilful enchanter."  </p>
Charran	<p>another form ( Acts 7:2 Acts 7:4 ) of Haran (q.v.).  </p>
Chebar	<p>length, a river in the "land of the Chaldeans" ( Ezekiel 1:3 ), on the banks of which were located some of the Jews of the Captivity ( Ezekiel 1:1 ;  Ezekiel 3:15 Ezekiel 3:23 ;  Ezekiel 10:15 Ezekiel 10:20 Ezekiel 10:22 ). It has been supposed to be identical with the river Habor, the Chaboras, or modern Khabour, which falls into the Euphrates at Circesium. To the banks of this river some of the Israelites were removed by the Assyrians ( 2 Kings 17:6 ). An opinion that has much to support it is that the "Chebar" was the royal canal of Nebuchadnezzar, the Nahr Malcha, the greatest in Mesopotamia, which connected the Tigris with the Euphrates, in the excavation of which the Jewish captives were probably employed.  </p>
Chedorlaomer	<p>(= Khudur-Lagamar of the inscriptions), king of Elam. Many centuries before the age of Abraham, Canaan and even the Sinaitic peninsula had been conquered by Babylonian kings, and in the time of Abraham himself Babylonia was ruled by a dynasty which claimed sovereignity over Syria and Palestine. The kings of the dynasty bore names which were not Babylonian, but at once South Arabic and Hebrew. The most famous king of the dynasty was Khammu-rabi, who united Babylonia under one rule, and made Babylon its capital. When he ascended the throne, the country was under the suzerainty of the Elamites, and was divided into two kingdoms, that of Babylon (the Biblical Shinar) and that of Larsa (the Biblical Ellasar). The king of Larsa was Eri-Aku ("the servant of the moon-god"), the son of an Elamite prince, Kudur-Mabug, who is entitled "the father of the land of the Amorites." A recently discovered tablet enumerates among the enemies of Khammu-rabi, Kudur-Lagamar ("the servant of the goddess Lagamar") or Chedorlaomer, Eri-Aku or Arioch, and Tudkhula or Tidal. Khammu-rabi, whose name is also read Ammi-rapaltu or Amraphel by some scholars, succeeded in overcoming Eri-Aku and driving the Elamites out of Babylonia. Assur-bani-pal, the last of the Assyrian conquerors, mentions in two inscriptions that he took Susa 1635 years after Kedor-nakhunta, king of Elam, had conquered Babylonia. It was in the year B.C. 660 that Assur-bani-pal took Susa.  </p>
Cheek	<p>Smiting on the cheek was accounted a grievous injury and insult ( Job 16:10 ;  Lamentations 3:30 ;  Micah 5:1 ). The admonition ( Luke 6:29 ), "Unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other," means simply, "Resist not evil" ( Matthew 5:39 ;  1 Peter 2:19-23 ).  Psalms 3:7  = that God had deprived his enemies of the power of doing him injury.  </p>
Cheese	<p>(A.S. cese). This word occurs three times in the Authorized Version as the translation of three different Hebrew words: </p><li> 1 Samuel 17:18 , "ten cheeses;" i.e., ten sections of curd. </li><li> 2 Samuel 17:29 , "cheese of kine" = perhaps curdled milk of kine. The Vulgate version reads "fat calves." </li><li> Job 10:10 , curdled milk is meant by the word.   </li>
Chemarim	<p>black, ( Zephaniah 1:4 ; rendered "idolatrous priests" in  2 Kings 23:5 , and "priests" in  Hosea 10:5 ). Some derive this word from the Assyrian Kamaru, meaning "to throw down," and interpret it as describing the idolatrous priests who prostrate themselves before the idols. Others regard it as meaning "those who go about in black," or "ascetics."  </p>
Chemosh	<p>the destroyer, subduer, or fish-god, the god of the Moabites ( Numbers 21:29 ;  Jeremiah 48:7 Jeremiah 48:13 Jeremiah 48:46 ). The worship of this god, "the abomination of Moab," was introduced at Jerusalem by Solomon ( 1 Kings 11:7 ), but was abolished by Josiah ( 2 Kings 23:13 ). On the "Moabite Stone" (q.v.), Mesha ( 2 Kings 3:5 ) ascribes his victories over the king of Israel to this god, "And Chemosh drove him before my sight."  </p>
Chenaanah	<p>merchant. </p><li> A Benjamite ( 1 Chronicles 7:10 ). </li><li> The father of Zedekiah ( 1 Kings 22:11 1 Kings 22:24 ).   </li>
Chenaiah	<p>whom Jehovah hath made. "Chief of the Levites," probably a Kohathite ( 1 Chronicles 15:22 ), and therefore not the same as mentioned in  26:29 .  </p>
Chephirah	<p>village, one of the four cities of the Gibeonitish Hivites with whom Joshua made a league ( 9:17 ). It belonged to Benjamin. It has been identified with the modern Kefireh, on the west confines of Benjamin, about 2 miles west of Ajalon and 11 from Jerusalem.  </p>
Cherethim	<p>( Ezekiel 25:16 ), more frequently Cherethites, the inhabitants of Southern Philistia, the Philistines ( Zephaniah 2:5 ). The Cherethites and the Pelethites were David's life-guards ( 1 Samuel 30:14 ;  2 Sam  8:18 ;  1 Samuel 20:7 1 Samuel 20:23 ;  23:23 ). This name is by some interpreted as meaning "Cretans," and by others "executioners," who were ready to execute the king's sentence of death ( Genesis 37:36 , marg.;  1 Kings 2:25 ).  </p>
Cherith	<p>a cutting; separation; a gorge, a torrent-bed or winter-stream, a "brook," in whose banks the prophet Elijah hid himself during the early part of the three years' drought ( 1 Kings 17:3 1 Kings 17:5 ). It has by some been identified as the Wady el-Kelt behind Jericho, which is formed by the junction of many streams flowing from the mountains west of Jericho. It is dry in summer. Travellers have described it as one of the wildest ravines of this wild region, and peculiarly fitted to afford a secure asylum to the persecuted. But if the prophet's interview with Ahab was in Samaria, and he thence journeyed toward the east, it is probable that he crossed Jordan and found refuge in some of the ravines of Gilead. The "brook" is said to have been "before Jordan," which probably means that it opened toward that river, into which it flowed. This description would apply to the east as well as to the west of Jordan. Thus Elijah's hiding-place may have been the Jermuk, in the territory of the half-tribe of Manasseh.  </p>
Cherub	<p>plural cherubim, the name of certain symbolical figures frequently mentioned in Scripture. They are first mentioned in connection with the expulsion of our first parents from Eden ( Genesis 3:24 ). There is no intimation given of their shape or form. They are next mentioned when Moses was commanded to provide furniture for the tabernacle ( Exodus 25:17-20 ;  Exodus 26:1 Exodus 26:31 ). God promised to commune with Moses "from between the cherubim" ( 25:22 ). This expression was afterwards used to denote the Divine abode and presence ( Numbers 7:89 ;  1 Samuel 4:4 ;  Isaiah 37:16 ;  Psalms 80:1 ;  99:1 ). In Ezekiel's vision ( 10:1-20 ) they appear as living creatures supporting the throne of God. From Ezekiel's description of them (1;10;  Psalms 41:18  Psalms 41:19 ), they appear to have been compound figures, unlike any real object in nature; artificial images possessing the features and properties of several animals. Two cherubim were placed on the mercy-seat of the ark; two of colossal size overshadowed it in Solomon's temple. ( Ezekiel 1:4-14 ) speaks of four; and this number of "living creatures" is mentioned in  Revelation 4:6 . Those on the ark are called the "cherubim of glory" ( Hebrews 9:5 ), i.e., of the Shechinah, or cloud of glory, for on them the visible glory of God rested. They were placed one at each end of the mercy-seat, with wings stretched upward, and their faces "toward each other and toward the mercy-seat." They were anointed with holy oil, like the ark itself and the other sacred furniture.  </p><p> The cherubim were symbolical. They were intended to represent spiritual existences in immediate contact with Jehovah. Some have regarded them as symbolical of the chief ruling power by which God carries on his operations in providence ( Psalms 18:10 ). Others interpret them as having reference to the redemption of men, and as symbolizing the great rulers or ministers of the church. Many other opinions have been held regarding them which need not be referred to here. On the whole, it seems to be most satisfactory to regard the interpretation of the symbol to be variable, as is the symbol itself.  </p><p> Their office was, (1) on the expulsion of our first parents from Eden, to prevent all access to the tree of life; and (2) to form the throne and chariot of Jehovah in his manifestation of himself on earth. He dwelleth between and sitteth on the cherubim ( 1 Samuel 4:4 ;  Psalms 80:1 ;  Ezekiel 1:26 Ezekiel 1:28 ).  </p>
Chesalon	<p>strength; confidence, a place on the border of Judah, on the side of Mount Jearim ( Joshua 15:10 ); probably identified with the modern village of Kesla, on the western mountains of Judah.  </p>
Chesed	<p>gain, the son of Nahor ( Genesis 22:22 ).  </p>
Chesil	<p>ungodly, a town in the south of Judah ( Joshua 15:30 ); probably the same as Bethul ( 19:4 ) and Bethuel ( 1 Chronicles 4:30 ); now Khelasa.  </p>
Chest	<p>(Heb. <i> 'aron</i> , generally rendered "ark"), the coffer into which the contributions for the repair of the temple were put ( 2 Kings 12:9 2 Kings 12:10 ;  2 Chr  2 Kings 24:8 2 Kings 24:10 2 Kings 24:11 ). In  Genesis 50:26  it is rendered "coffin." In  Ezekiel 27:24  a different Hebrew word, <i> genazim</i> (plur.), is used. It there means "treasure-chests." </p>
Chestnut tree	<p>(Heb. <i> 'armon</i> ; i.e., "naked"), mentioned in connection with Jacob's artifice regarding the cattle ( Genesis 30:37 ). It is one of the trees of which, because of its strength and beauty, the Assyrian empire is likened ( Ezekiel 31:8 ; RSV, "plane trees"). It is probably the Oriental plane tree (Platanus orientalis) that is intended. It is a characteristic of this tree that it annually sheds its outer bark, becomes "naked." The chestnut tree proper is not a native of Palestine.  </p>
Chesulloth	<p>fertile places; the loins, a town of Issachar, on the slopes of some mountain between Jezreel and Shunem ( Joshua 19:18 ). It has been identified with Chisloth-tabor, 2 1/2 miles to the west of Mount Tabor, and north of Jezreel; now Iksal.  </p>
Chezib	<p>deceitful, a town where Shelah, the son of Judah, was born ( Genesis 38:5 ). Probably the same as Achzib (q.v.).  </p>
Chidon	<p>dart, the name of the threshing-floor at which the death of Uzzah took place ( 1 Chronicles 13:9 ). In the parallel passage in Samuel ( 2 Samuel 6:6 ) it is called "Nachon's threshing-floor." It was a place not far north-west from Jerusalem.  </p>
Chief of the three	<p>a title given to Adino the Eznite, one of David's greatest heroes ( 2 Samuel 23:8 ); also called Jashobeam ( 1 Chronicles 11:11 ).  </p>
Chief priest	<p>See PRIEST . </p>
Chiefs of Asia	<p>"Asiarchs," the title given to certain wealthy persons annually appointed to preside over the religious festivals and games in the various cities of proconsular Asia ( Acts 19:31 ). Some of these officials appear to have been Paul's friends.  </p>
Child	<p>This word has considerable latitude of meaning in Scripture. Thus Joseph is called a child at the time when he was probably about sixteen years of age ( Genesis 37:3 ); and Benjamin is so called when he was above thirty years ( 44:20 ). Solomon called himself a little child when he came to the kingdom ( 1 Kings 3:7 ).  </p><p> The descendants of a man, however remote, are called his children; as, "the children of Edom," "the children of Moab," "the children of Israel." </p><p> In the earliest times mothers did not wean their children till they were from thirty months to three years old; and the day on which they were weaned was kept as a festival day ( Genesis 21:8 ;  Exodus 2:7 Exodus 2:9 ;  1 Samuel 1:22-24 ;  Matthew 21:16 ). At the age of five, children began to learn the arts and duties of life under the care of their fathers ( Deuteronomy 6:20-25 ;  11:19 ).  </p><p> To have a numerous family was regarded as a mark of divine favour ( Genesis 11:30 ;  30:1 ;  1 Samuel 2:5 ;  2 Sam  6:23 ;  Psalms 127:3 ;  128:3 ).  </p><p> Figuratively the name is used for those who are ignorant or narrow-minded ( Matthew 11:16 ;  Luke 7:32 ;  1 Corinthians 13:11 ). "When I was a child, I spake as a child." "Brethren, be not children in understanding" ( 1 Corinthians 14:20 ). "That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro" ( Ephesians 4:14 ).  </p><p> Children are also spoken of as representing simplicity and humility ( Matthew 19:13-15 ;  Mark 10:13-16 ;  Luke 18:15-17 ). Believers are "children of light" ( Luke 16:8 ;  1 Thessalonians 5:5 ) and "children of obedience" ( 1 Peter 1:14 ).  </p>
Chileab	<p>protected by the father, David's second son by Abigail ( 2 Samuel 3:3 ); called also Daniel ( 1 Chronicles 3:1 ). He seems to have died when young.  </p>
Chilion	<p>the pining one, the younger son of Elimelech and Naomi, and husband of Orpah, Ruth's sister ( Ruth 1:2 ;  4:9 ).  </p>
Chilmad	<p>a place or country unknown which, along with Sheba and Asshur, traded with Tyre ( Ezekiel 27:23 ).  </p>
Chimham	<p>pining, probably the youngest son of Barzillai the Gileadite ( 2 Samuel 19:37-40 ). The "habitation of Chimham" ( Jeremiah 41:17 ) was probably an inn or khan, which is the proper meaning of the Hebrew <i> geruth</i> , rendered "habitation", established in later times in his possession at Bethlehem, which David gave to him as a reward for his loyalty in accompanying him to Jerusalem after the defeat of Absalom ( 1 Kings 2:7 ). It has been supposed that, considering the stationary character of Eastern institutions, it was in the stable of this inn or caravanserai that our Saviour was born ( Luke 2:7 ).  </p>
Chinnereth	<p>lyre, the singular form of the word ( Deuteronomy 3:17 ;  Joshua 19:35 ), which is also used in the plural form, Chinneroth, the name of a fenced city which stood near the shore of the lake of Galilee, a little to the south of Tiberias. The town seems to have given its name to a district, as appears from  1 Kings 15:20 , where the plural form of the word is used.  </p><p> The Sea of Chinnereth ( Numbers 34:11 ;  Joshua 13:27 ), or of Chinneroth ( Joshua 12: :  3 ), was the "lake of Gennesaret" or "sea of Tiberias" ( Deuteronomy 3:17 ;  Joshua 11:2 ). Chinnereth was probably an ancient Canaanitish name adopted by the Israelites into their language.  </p>
Chios	<p>mentioned in  Acts 20:15 , an island in the Aegean Sea, about 5 miles distant from the mainland, having a roadstead, in the shelter of which Paul and his companions anchored for a night when on his third missionary return journey. It is now called Scio.  </p>
Chisleu	<p>the name adopted from the Babylonians by the Jews after the Captivity for the third civil, or ninth ecclesiastical, month ( Nehemiah 1:1 ;  Zechariah 7:1 ). It corresponds nearly with the moon in November.  </p>
Chittim	<p>or Kittim, a plural form ( Genesis 10:4 ), the name of a branch of the descendants of Javan, the "son" of Japheth. Balaam foretold ( Numbers 24:24 ) "that ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and afflict Eber." Daniel prophesied ( 11:30 ) that the ships of Chittim would come against the king of the north. It probably denotes Cyprus, whose ancient capital was called Kition by the Greeks.  </p><p> The references elsewhere made to Chittim ( Isaiah 23:1 Isaiah 23:12 ;  Jeremiah 2:10 ;  Ezekiel 27:6 ) are to be explained on the ground that while the name originally designated the Phoenicians only, it came latterly to be used of all the islands and various settlements on the sea-coasts which they had occupied, and then of the people who succeeded them when the Phoenician power decayed. Hence it designates generally the islands and coasts of the Mediterranean and the races that inhabit them.  </p>
Chiun	<p>occurs only in  Amos 5:26  (RSV marg., "shrine"). The LXX. translated the word by Rhephan, which became corrupted into Remphan, as used by Stephen ( Acts 7:43 ; but RSV, "Rephan"). Probably the planet Saturn is intended by the name. Astrologers represented this planet as baleful in its influences, and hence the Phoenicians offered to it human sacrifices, especially children.  </p>
Chloe	<p>verdure, a female Christian ( 1 Corinthians 1:11 ), some of whose household had informed Paul of the divided state of the Corinthian church. Nothing is known of her.  </p>
Chor-ashan	<p>smoking furnace, one of the places where "David himself and his men were wont to haunt" ( 1 Samuel 30:30 1 Samuel 30:31 ). It is probably identical with Ashan ( Joshua 15:42 ;  19:7 ), a Simeonite city in the Negeb, i.e., the south, belonging to Judah. The word ought, according to another reading, to be "Bor-ashan."  </p>
Chorazin	<p>named along with Bethsaida and Capernaum as one of the cities in which our Lord's "mighty works" were done, and which was doomed to woe because of signal privileges neglected ( Matthew 11:21 ;  Luke 10:13 ). It has been identified by general consent with the modern Kerazeh, about 2 1/2 miles up the Wady Kerazeh from Capernaum; i.e., Tell Hum.  </p>
Daberath	<p>pasture, a Levitical town of Issachar ( Joshua 19:12 ;  21:28 ), near the border of Zebulum. It is the modern small village of Deburich, at the base of Mount Tabor. Tradition has incorrectly made it the scene of the miracle of the cure of the lunatic child ( Matthew 17:14 ).  </p>
Daemon	<p>the Greek form, rendered "devil" in the Authorized Version of the New Testament. Daemons are spoken of as spiritual beings ( Matthew 8:16 ;  10:1 ;  12:43-45 ) at enmity with God, and as having a certain power over man ( James 2:19 ;  Revelation 16:14 ). They recognize our Lord as the Son of God ( Matthew 8:20 ;  Luke 4:41 ). They belong to the number of those angels that "kept not their first estate," "unclean spirits," "fallen angels," the angels of the devil ( Matthew 25:41 ;  Revelation 12:7-9 ). They are the "principalities and powers" against which we must "wrestle" ( Ephesians 6:12 ).  </p>
Daemoniac	<p>one "possessed with a devil." In the days of our Lord and his apostles, evil spirits, "daemons," were mysteriously permitted by God to exercise an influence both over the souls and bodies of men, inflicting dumbness ( Matthew 9:32 ), blindness ( 12:22 ), epilepsy ( Mark 9:17-27 ), insanity ( Matthew 8:28 ;  Mark 5:1-5 ). Daemoniacs are frequently distinguished from those who are afflicted with ordinary bodily maladies ( Mark 1:32 ;  Mark 16:17 Mark 16:18 ;  Luke 6:17 Luke 6:18 ). The daemons speak in their own persons ( Matthew 8:29 ;  Mark 1:23 Mark 1:24 ;  5:7 ). This influence is clearly distinguished from the ordinary power of corruption and of temptation over men. In the daemoniac his personality seems to be destroyed, and his actions, words, and even thoughts to be overborne by the evil spirit (Mark, l.c.;  Acts 19:15 ).  </p>
Dagon	<p>little fish; diminutive from dag = a fish, the fish-god; the national god of the Philistines ( Judges 16:23 ). This idol had the body of a fish with the head and hands of a man. It was an Assyrio-Babylonian deity, the worship of which was introduced among the Philistines through Chaldea. The most famous of the temples of Dagon were at Gaza ( Judges 16:23-30 ) and Ashdod ( 1 Samuel 5:1-7 ). (See FISH .) </p>
Dagons house	<p>( 1 Samuel 5:2 ), or Beth-dagon, as elsewhere rendered (Josh.15: 41;  <span class="badLink">19:27</span> ), was the sanctuary or temple of Dagon.  </p><p> The Beth-dagon of  Joshua 15:41  was one of the cities of the tribe of Judah, in the lowland or plain which stretches westward. It has not been identified.  </p><p> The Beth-dagon of  Joshua 19:27  was one of the border cities of Asher.  </p><p> That of  1 Chronicles 10:10  was in the western half-tribe of Manasseh, where the Philistines, after their victory at Gilboa, placed Saul's head in the temple of their god. (Compare  1 Samuel 31:8-13 ).  </p>
Daily sacrifice	<p>( Daniel 8:12 ;  11:31 ;  12:11 ), a burnt offering of two lambs of a year old, which were daily sacrificed in the name of the whole Israelitish people upon the great altar, the first at dawn of day, and the second at evening ( Daniel 9:21 ), or more correctly, "between the two evenings." (See SACRIFICE .) </p>
Dale, the kings	<p>the name of a valley, the alternative for "the valley of Shaveh" (q.v.), near the Dead Sea, where the king of Sodom met Abraham ( Genesis 14:17 ). Some have identified it with the southern part of the valley of Jehoshaphat, where Absalom reared his family monument ( 2 Samuel 18:18 ).  </p>
Dalmanutha	<p>a place on the west of the Sea of Galilee, mentioned only in  Mark 8:10 . In the parallel passage it is said that Christ came "into the borders of Magdala" ( Matthew 15:39 ). It is plain, then, that Dalmanutha was near Magdala, which was probably the Greek name of one of the many Migdols (i.e., watch-towers) on the western side of the lake of Gennesaret. It has been identified in the ruins of a village about a mile from Magdala, in the little open valley of 'Ain-el-Barideh, "the cold fountain," called el-Mejdel, possibly the "Migdal-el" of  Joshua 19:38 .  </p>
Dalmatia	<p>a mountainous country on the eastern shore of the Adriatic, a part of the Roman province of Illyricum. It still bears its ancient name. During Paul's second imprisonment at Rome, Titus left him to visit Dalmatia ( 2 Timothy 4:10 ) for some unknown purpose. Paul had himself formerly preached in that region ( Romans 15:19 ).  </p><p> The present Emperor of Austria bears, among his other titles, that of "King of Dalmatia." </p>
Damaris	<p>a heifer, an Athenian woman converted to Christianity under the preaching of Paul ( Acts 17:34 ). Some have supposed that she may have been the wife of Dionysius the Areopagite.  </p>
Damascus	<p>activity, the most ancient of Oriental cities; the capital of Syria ( Isaiah 7:8 ;  17:3 ); situated about 133 miles to the north of Jerusalem. Its modern name is Esh-Sham; i.e., "the East."  </p><p> The situation of this city is said to be the most beautiful of all Western Asia. It is mentioned among the conquests of the Egyptian king Thothmes III. (B.C. 1500), and in the Amarna tablets (B.C. 1400).  </p><p> It is first mentioned in Scripture in connection with Abraham's victory over the confederate kings under Chedorlaomer ( Genesis 14:15 ). It was the native place of Abraham's steward ( 15:2 ). It is not again noticed till the time of David, when "the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer" (q.v.),  2 Samuel 8:5 ;  1 Chronicles 18:5 . In the reign of Solomon, Rezon became leader of a band who revolted from Hadadezer ( 1 Kings 11:23 ), and betaking themselves to Damascus, settled there and made their leader king. There was a long war, with varying success, between the Israelites and Syrians, who at a later period became allies of Israel against Judah ( 2 Kings 15:37 ).  </p><p> The Syrians were at length subdued by the Assyrians, the city of Damascus was taken and destroyed, and the inhabitants carried captive into Assyria ( 2 Kings 16:7-9 ; Compare  Isaiah 7:8 ). In this, prophecy was fulfilled ( Isaiah 17:1 ;  Amos 1:4 ;  Jeremiah 49:24 ). The kingdom of Syria remained a province of Assyria till the capture of Nineveh by the Medes (B.C. 625), when it fell under the conquerors. After passing through various vicissitudes, Syria was invaded by the Romans (B.C. 64), and Damascus became the seat of the government of the province. In A.D. 37 Aretas, the king of Arabia, became master of Damascus, having driven back Herod Antipas.  </p><p> This city is memorable as the scene of Saul's conversion ( Acts 9:1-25 ). The street called "Straight," in which Judas lived, in whose house Saul was found by Ananias, is known by the name Sultany, or "Queen's Street." It is the principal street of the city. Paul visited Damascus again on his return from Arabia ( Galatians 1:16 Galatians 1:17 ). Christianity was planted here as a centre ( Acts 9:20 ), from which it spread to the surrounding regions.  </p><p> In A.D. 634 Damascus was conquered by the growing Mohammedan power. In A.D. 1516 it fell under the dominion of the Turks, its present rulers. It is now the largest city in Asiatic Turkey. Christianity has again found a firm footing within its walls.  </p>
Damnation	<p>in  Romans 13:2 , means "condemnation," which comes on those who withstand God's ordinance of magistracy. This sentence of condemnation comes not from the magistrate, but from God, whose authority is thus resisted.  </p><p> In  1 Corinthians 11:29  (RSV, "judgment") this word means condemnation, in the sense of exposure to severe temporal judgements from God, as the following verse explains.  </p><p> In  Romans 14:23  the word "damned" means "condemned" by one's own conscience, as well as by the Word of God. The apostle shows here that many things which are lawful are not expedient; and that in using our Christian liberty the question should not simply be, Is this course I follow lawful? but also, Can I follow it without doing injury to the spiritual interests of a brother in Christ? He that "doubteth", i.e., is not clear in his conscience as to "meats", will violate his conscience "if he eat," and in eating is condemned; and thus one ought not so to use his liberty as to lead one who is "weak" to bring upon himself this condemnation.  </p>
Dan	<p>a judge. </p><li> The fifth son of Jacob. His mother was Bilhah, Rachel's maid ( Genesis 30:6 , "God hath judged me", Heb. dananni). The blessing pronounced on him by his father was, "Dan shall judge his people" ( 49:16 ), probably in allusion to the judgeship of Samson, who was of the tribe of Dan.  <p> The tribe of Dan had their place in the march through the wilderness on the north side of the tabernacle ( Numbers 2:25 Numbers 2:31 ;  10:25 ). It was the last of the tribes to receive a portion in the Land of Promise. Its position and extent are described in  Joshua 19:40-48 .  </p><p> The territory of Dan extended from the west of that of Ephraim and Benjamin to the sea. It was a small territory, but was very fertile. It included in it, among others, the cities of Lydda, Ekron, and Joppa, which formed its northern boundary. But this district was too limited. "Squeezed into the narrow strip between the mountains and the sea, its energies were great beyond its numbers." Being pressed by the Amorites and the Philistines, whom they were unable to conquer, they longed for a wider space. They accordingly sent out five spies from two of their towns, who went north to the sources of the Jordan, and brought back a favourable report regarding that region. "Arise," they said, "be not slothful to go, and to possess the land," for it is "a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth" ( Judges 18:10 ). On receiving this report, 600 Danites girded on their weapons of war, and taking with them their wives and their children, marched to the foot of Hermon, and fought against Leshem, and took it from the Sidonians, and dwelt therein, and changed the name of the conquered town to Dan ( Joshua 19:47 ). This new city of Dan became to them a new home, and was wont to be spoken of as the northern limit of Palestine, the length of which came to be denoted by the expression "from Dan to Beersheba", i.e., about 144 miles.  </p><p> "But like Lot under a similar temptation, they seem to have succumbed to the evil influences around them, and to have sunk down into a condition of semi-heathenism from which they never emerged. The mounds of ruins which mark the site of the city show that it covered a considerable extent of ground. But there remains no record of any noble deed wrought by the degenerate tribe. Their name disappears from the roll-book of the natural and the spiritual Israel.", Manning's Those Holy Fields. </p><p> This old border city was originally called Laish. Its modern name is Tell el-Kady, "Hill of the Judge." It stands about four miles below Caesarea Philippi, in the midst of a region of surpassing richness and beauty. </p></li><li> This name occurs in  Ezekiel 27:19 , Authorize Version; but the words there, "Dan also," should be simply, as in the Revised Version, "Vedan," an Arabian city, from which various kinds of merchandise were brought to Tyre. Some suppose it to have been the city of Aden in Arabia. (See MAHANEH-DAN.)   </li>
Dance	<p>found in  Judges 21:21 Judges 21:23 ;  Psalms 30:11 ;  149:3 ;  150:4 ;  Jeremiah 31:4 Jeremiah 31:13 , etc., as the translation of <i> hul</i> , which points to the whirling motion of Oriental sacred dances. It is the rendering of a word (rakad') which means to skip or leap for joy, in Eccl.  3:4 ;  Job 21:11 ;  Isaiah 13:21 , etc.  </p><p> In the New Testament it is in like manner the translation of different Greek words, circular motion ( Luke 15:25 ); leaping up and down in concert ( Matthew 11:17 ), and by a single person ( Matthew 14:6 ).  </p><p> It is spoken of as symbolical of rejoicing (Eccl  3:4 . Compare  Psalms 30:11 ;  Matthew 11: :  17 ). The Hebrews had their sacred dances expressive of joy and thanksgiving, when the performers were usually females ( Exodus 15:20 ;  1 Samuel 18:6 ).  </p><p> The ancient dance was very different from that common among Western nations. It was usually the part of the women only ( Exodus 15:20 ;  Judges 11:34 ; comp  5:1 ). Hence the peculiarity of David's conduct in dancing before the ark of the Lord ( 2 Samuel 6:14 ). The women took part in it with their timbrels. Michal should, in accordance with the example of Miriam and others, have herself led the female choir, instead of keeping aloof on the occasion and "looking through the window." David led the choir "uncovered", i.e., wearing only the ephod or linen tunic. He thought only of the honour of God, and forgot himself.  </p><p> From being reserved for occasions of religious worship and festivity, it came gradually to be practised in common life on occasions of rejoicing ( Jeremiah 31:4 ). The sexes among the Jews always danced separately. The daughter of Herodias danced alone ( Matthew 14:6 ).  </p>
Daniel	<p>God is my judge, or judge of God. </p><li> David's second son, "born unto him in Hebron, of Abigail the Carmelitess" ( 1 Chronicles 3:1 ). He is called also Chileab ( 2 Samuel 3:3 ).  </li><li> One of the four great prophets, although he is not once spoken of in the Old Testament as a prophet. His life and prophecies are recorded in the Book of Daniel. He was descended from one of the noble families of Judah ( Daniel 1:3 ), and was probably born in Jerusalem about B.C. 623, during the reign of Josiah. At the first deportation of the Jews by Nebuchadnezzar (the kingdom of Israel had come to an end nearly a century before), or immediately after his victory over the Egyptians at the second battle of Carchemish, in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim (B.C. 606), Daniel and other three noble youths were carried off to Babylon, along with part of the vessels of the temple. There he was obliged to enter into the service of the king of Babylon, and in accordance with the custom of the age received the Chaldean name of Belteshazzar, i.e., "prince of Bel," or "Bel protect the king!" His residence in Babylon was very probably in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar, now identified with a mass of shapeless mounds called the Kasr, on the right bank of the river.  <p> His training in the schools of the wise men in Babylon ( Daniel 1:4 ) was to fit him for service to the empire. He was distinguished during this period for his piety and his stict observance of the Mosaic law ( 1:8-16 ), and gained the confidence and esteem of those who were over him. His habit of attention gained during his education in Jerusalem enabled him soon to master the wisdom and learning of the Chaldeans, and even to excel his compeers.  </p><p> At the close of his three years of discipline and training in the royal schools, Daniel was distinguished for his proficiency in the "wisdom" of his day, and was brought out into public life. He soon became known for his skill in the interpretation of dreams ( 1:17 ;  2:14 ), and rose to the rank of governor of the province of Babylon, and became "chief of the governors" (Chald. Rab-signin) over all the wise men of Babylon. He made known and also interpreted Nebuchadnezzar's dream; and many years afterwards, when he was now an old man, amid the alarm and consternation of the terrible night of Belshazzar's impious feast, he was called in at the instance of the queen-mother (perhaps Nitocris, the daughter of Nebuchadnezzar) to interpret the mysterious handwriting on the wall. He was rewarded with a purple robe and elevation to the rank of "third ruler." The place of "second ruler" was held by Belshazzar as associated with his father, Nabonidus, on the throne ( 5:16 ). Daniel interpreted the handwriting, and "in that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain."  </p><p> After the taking of Babylon, Cyrus, who was now master of all Asia from India to the Dardanelles, placed Darius (q.v.), a Median prince, on the throne, during the two years of whose reign Daniel held the office of first of the "three presidents" of the empire, and was thus practically at the head of affairs, no doubt interesting himself in the prospects of the captive Jews ( Daniel 9 ), whom he had at last the happiness of seeing restored to their own land, although he did not return with them, but remained still in Babylon. His fidelity to God exposed him to persecution, and he was cast into a den of lions, but was miraculously delivered; after which Darius issued a decree enjoining reverence for "the God of Daniel" ( 6:26 ). He "prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian," whom he probably greatly influenced in the matter of the decree which put an end to the Captivity (B.C. 536).  </p><p> He had a series of prophetic visions vouch-safed to him which opened up the prospect of a glorious future for the people of God, and must have imparted peace and gladness to his spirit in his old age as he waited on at his post till the "end of the days." The time and circumstances of his death are not recorded. He probably died at Susa, about eighty-five years of age. </p><p> Ezekiel, with whom he was contemporary, mentions him as a pattern of righteousness ( Daniel 14:14  Daniel 14:20 ) and wisdom ( 28:3 ). (See NEBUCHADNEZZAR .) </p> </li>
Daniel, Book of	<p>is ranked by the Jews in that division of their Bible called the Hagiographa (Heb. Khethubim). (See BIBLE .) It consists of two distinct parts. The first part, consisting of the first six chapters, is chiefly historical; and the second part, consisting of the remaining six chapters, is chiefly prophetical. </p><p> The historical part of the book treats of the period of the Captivity. Daniel is "the historian of the Captivity, the writer who alone furnishes any series of events for that dark and dismal period during which the harp of Israel hung on the trees that grew by the Euphrates. His narrative may be said in general to intervene between Kings and Chronicles on the one hand and Ezra on the other, or (more strictly) to fill out the sketch which the author of the Chronicles gives in a single verse in his last chapter: 'And them that had escaped from the sword carried he [i.e., Nebuchadnezzar] away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia'" ( 2 Chronicles 36:20 ).  </p><p> The prophetical part consists of three visions and one lengthened prophetical communication. </p><p> The genuineness of this book has been much disputed, but the arguments in its favour fully establish its claims. </p><li> We have the testimony of Christ ( Matthew 24:15 ;  25:31 ;  26:64 ) and his apostles ( 1 Corinthians 6:2 ;  2 th  2:3 ) for its authority; and (2) the important testimony of ( Ezekiel 14:14 Ezekiel 14:20 ;  28:3 ). </li><li> The character and records of the book are also entirely in harmony with the times and circumstances in which the author lived. </li><li> The linguistic character of the book is, moreover, just such as might be expected. Certain portions ( Daniel 2:4 ;  7 ) are written in the Chaldee language; and the portions written in Hebrew are in a style and form having a close affinity with the later books of the Old Testament, especially with that of Ezra. The writer is familiar both with the Hebrew and the Chaldee, passing from the one to the other just as his subject required. This is in strict accordance with the position of the author and of the people for whom his book was written. That Daniel is the writer of this book is also testified to in the book itself ( Daniel 7:1 Daniel 7:28 ;  8:2 ;  9:2 ;  Daniel 10:1 Daniel 10:2 ;  Daniel 12:4 Daniel 12:5 ). (See BELSHAZZAR .)  </li>
Dan-jaan	<p>woodland Dan, a place probably somewhere in the direction of Dan, near the sources of the Jordan ( 2 Samuel 24:6 ). The LXX. and the Vulgate read "Dan-ja'ar", i.e., "Dan in the forest."  </p>
Dannah	<p>murmuring, a city ( Joshua 15:49 ) in the mountains of Judah about 8 miles south-west of Hebron.  </p>
Darda	<p>pearl of wisdom, one of the four who were noted for their wisdom, but whom Solomon excelled ( 1 Kings 4:31 ).  </p>
Daric	<p>in the Revised Version of  1 Chronicles 29:7 ;  Ezra 2:69 ;  8:27 ;  Nehemiah 7:70-72 , where the Authorized Version has "dram." It is the rendering of the Hebrew darkemon and the Greek dareikos. It was a gold coin, bearing the figure of a Persian King with his crown and armed with bow and arrow. It was current among the Jews after their return from Babylon, i.e., while under the Persian domination. It weighed about 128 grains troy, and was of the value of about one guinea or rather more of our money. It is the first coin mentioned in Scripture, and is the oldest that history makes known to us.  </p>
Darius	<p>the holder or supporter, the name of several Persian kings. </p><li> Darius the Mede ( Daniel 11:1 ), "the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes" ( 9:1 ). On the death of Belshazzar the Chaldean he "received the kingdom" of Babylon as viceroy from Cyrus. During his brief reign (B.C. 538-536) Daniel was promoted to the highest dignity ( Daniel 6:1 Daniel 6:2 ); but on account of the malice of his enemies he was cast into the den of lions. After his miraculous escape, a decree was issued by Darius enjoining "reverence for the God of Daniel" ( 6:26 ). This king was probably the "Astyages" of the Greek historians. Nothing can, however, be with certainty affirmed regarding him. Some are of opinion that the name "Darius" is simply a name of office, equivalent to "governor," and that the "Gobryas" of the inscriptions was the person intended by the name.  </li><li> Darius, king of Persia, was the son of Hystaspes, of the royal family of the Achaemenidae. He did not immediately succeed Cyrus on the throne. There were two intermediate kings, viz., Cambyses (the Ahasuerus of Ezra), the son of Cyrus, who reigned from B.C. 529-522, and was succeeded by a usurper named Smerdis, who occupied the throne only ten months, and was succeeded by this Darius (B.C. 521-486). Smerdis was a Margian, and therefore had no sympathy with Cyrus and Cambyses in the manner in which they had treated the Jews. He issued a decree prohibiting the restoration of the temple and of Jerusalem ( Ezra 4:17-22 ). But soon after his death and the accession of Darius, the Jews resumed their work, thinking that the edict of Smerdis would be now null and void, as Darius was in known harmony with the religious policy of Cyrus. The enemies of the Jews lost no time in bringing the matter under the notice of Darius, who caused search to be made for the decree of Cyrus (q.v.). It was not found at Babylon, but at Achmetha ( Ezra 6:2 ); and Darius forthwith issued a new decree, giving the Jews full liberty to prosecute their work, at the same time requiring the Syrian satrap and his subordinates to give them all needed help. It was with the army of this king that the Greeks fought the famous battle of Marathon (B.C. 490). During his reign the Jews enjoyed much peace and prosperity. He was succeeded by Ahasuerus, known to the Greeks as Xerxes, who reigned for twenty-one years.  </li><li> Darius the Persian ( Nehemiah 12:22 ) was probably the Darius II. (Ochus or Nothus) of profane history, the son of Artaxerxes Longimanus, who was the son and successor of Ahasuerus (Xerxes). There are some, however, who think that the king here meant was Darius III. (Codomannus), the antagonist of Alexander the Great (B.C. 336-331).   </li>
Darkness	<p>The plague (the ninth) of darkness in Egypt ( Exodus 10:21 ) is described as darkness "which may be felt." It covered "all the land of Egypt," so that "they saw not one another." It did not extend to the land of Goshen (ver. 23).  </p><p> When Jesus hung upon the cross ( Matthew 27:45 ;  Luke 23:44 ), from the "sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour."  </p><p> On Mount Sinai, Moses ( Exodus 20:21 ) "drew near unto the thick darkness where God was." This was the "thick cloud upon the mount" in which Jehovah was when he spake unto Moses there. The Lord dwelt in the cloud upon the mercy-seat ( 1 Kings 8:12 ), the cloud of glory. When the psalmist ( Psalms 97:2 ) describes the inscrutable nature of God's workings among the sons of men, he says, "Clouds and darkness are round about him." God dwells in thick darkness.  </p><p> Darkness ( Isaiah 13:9 Isaiah 13:10 ;  Matthew 24:29 ) also is a symbol of the judgments that attend on the coming of the Lord. It is a symbol of misery and adversity ( Job 18:6 ;  Psalms 107:10 ;  Isaiah 8:22 ; Ezek.  30:18 ). The "day of darkness" in  Joel 2:2 , caused by clouds of locusts, is a symbol of the obscurity which overhangs all divine proceedings. "Works of darkness" are impure actions ( Ephesians 5:11 ). "Outer darkness" refers to the darkness of the streets in the East, which are never lighted up by any public or private lamps after nightfall, in contrast with the blaze of cheerful light in the house. It is also a symbol of ignorance ( Isaiah 9:2 ;  60:2 ;  Matthew 6:23 ) and of death ( Job 10:21 ;  17:13 ).  </p>
Darling	<p> Psalms 22:20 ;  35:17 ) means an "only one."  </p>
Dart	<p>an instrument of war; a light spear. "Fiery darts" ( Ephesians 6:16 ) are so called in allusion to the habit of discharging darts from the bow while they are on fire or armed with some combustible material. Arrows are compared to lightning ( Deuteronomy 32:23 Deuteronomy 32:42 ;  Psalms 7:13 ;  120:4 ).  </p>
Date	<p>the fruit of a species of palm (q.v.), the Phoenix dactilifera. This was a common tree in Palestine ( Joel 1:12 ;  Nehemiah 8:15 ). Palm branches were carried by the Jews on festive occasions, and especially at the feast of Tabernacles ( Leviticus 23:40 ;  Nehemiah 8:15 ).  </p>
Dathan	<p>welled; belonging to a fountain, a son of Eliab, a Reubenite, who joined Korah (q.v.) in his conspiracy, and with his accomplices was swallowed up by an earthquake ( Numbers 16:1 ;  26:9 ;  Deuteronomy 11:6 ;  Psalms 106:17 ).  </p>
Daughter	<p>This word, besides its natural and proper sense, is used to designate, </p><li> A niece or any female descendant ( Genesis 20:12 ;  24:48 ;  28:6 ). </li><li> Women as natives of a place, or as professing the religion of a place; as, "the daughters of Zion" ( Isaiah 3:16 ), "daughters of the Philistines" ( 2 Samuel 1:20 ). </li><li> Small towns and villages lying around a city are its "daughters," as related to the metropolis or mother city. Tyre is in this sense called the daughter of Sidon ( Isaiah 23:12 ). </li><li> The people of Jerusalem are spoken of as "the daughters of Zion" ( Isaiah 37:22 ). </li><li> The daughters of a tree are its boughs ( Genesis 49:22 ). </li><li> The "daughters of music" (Eccl  12:4 ) are singing women.   </li>
David	<p>beloved, the eighth and youngest son of Jesse, a citizen of Bethlehem. His father seems to have been a man in humble life. His mother's name is not recorded. Some think she was the Nahash of  2 Samuel 17:25 . As to his personal appearance, we only know that he was red-haired, with beautiful eyes and a fair face ( 1 Samuel 16:12 ;  17:42 ).  </p><p> His early occupation was that of tending his father's sheep on the uplands of Judah. From what we know of his after history, doubtless he frequently beguiled his time, when thus engaged, with his shepherd's flute, while he drank in the many lessons taught him by the varied scenes spread around him. His first recorded exploits were his encounters with the wild beasts of the field. He mentions that with his own unaided hand he slew a lion and also a bear, when they came out against his flock, beating them to death in open conflict with his club ( 1 Samuel 17:34 1 Samuel 17:35 ).  </p><p> While David, in the freshness of ruddy youth, was thus engaged with his flocks, Samuel paid an unexpected visit to Bethlehem, having been guided thither by divine direction ( 1 Samuel 16:1-13 ). There he offered up sacrifice, and called the elders of Israel and Jesse's family to the sacrificial meal. Among all who appeared before him he failed to discover the one he sought. David was sent for, and the prophet immediately recognized him as the chosen of God, chosen to succeed Saul, who was now departing from the ways of God, on the throne of the kingdom. He accordingly, in anticipation, poured on his head the anointing oil. David went back again to his shepherd life, but "the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward," and "the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul" ( 1 Samuel 16:13 1 Samuel 16:14 ).  </p><p> Not long after this David was sent for to soothe with his harp the troubled spirit of Saul, who suffered from a strange melancholy dejection. He played before the king so skilfully that Saul was greatly cheered, and began to entertain great affection for the young shepherd. After this he went home to Bethlehem. But he soon again came into prominence. The armies of the Philistines and of Israel were in battle array in the valley of Elah, some 16 miles south-west of Bethlehem; and David was sent by his father with provisions for his three brothers, who were then fighting on the side of the king. On his arrival in the camp of Israel, David (now about twenty years of age) was made aware of the state of matters when the champion of the Philistines, Goliath of Gath, came forth to defy Israel. David took his sling, and with a well-trained aim threw a stone "out of the brook," which struck the giant's forehead, so that he fell senseless to the ground. David then ran and slew him, and cut off his head with his own sword ( 1 Samuel 17 ). The result was a great victory to the Israelites, who pursued the Philistines to the gates of Gath and Ekron.  </p><p> David's popularity consequent on this heroic exploit awakened Saul's jealousy ( 1 Samuel 18:6-16 ), which he showed in various ways. He conceived a bitter hatred toward him, and by various stratagems sought his death ( 1 Samuel 1830 -30). The deep-laid plots of the enraged king, who could not fail to observe that David "prospered exceedingly," all proved futile, and only endeared the young hero the more to the people, and very specially to Jonathan, Saul's son, between whom and David a life-long warm friendship was formed.  </p><p> A fugitive. To escape from the vengeance of Saul, David fled to Ramah ( 1 Samuel 19:12-18 ) to Samuel, who received him, and he dwelt among the sons of the prophets, who were there under Samuel's training. It is supposed by some that the sixth, seventh, and eleventh Psalms were composed by him at this time. This place was only 3 miles from the residence of Saul, who soon discovered whither the fugitive had gone, and tried ineffectually to bring him back. Jonathan made a fruitless effort to bring his father to a better state of mind toward David ( 1 Samuel 20 ), who, being made aware of the fact, saw no hope of safety but in flight to a distance. We accordingly find him first at Nob ( 21:1-9 ) and then at Gath, the chief city of the Philistines. The king of the Philistines would not admit him into his service, as he expected that he would, and David accordingly now betook himself to the stronghold of Adullam ( 22:1-4 ;  1 Chronicles 12:8-18 ). Here in a short time 400 men gathered around him and acknowledged him as their leader. It was at this time that David, amid the harassment and perils of his position, cried, "Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem;" when three of his heroes broke through the lines of the Philistines and brought him the water for which he longed ( 2 Samuel 23:13-17 ), but which he would not drink.  </p><p> In his rage at the failure of all his efforts to seize David, Saul gave orders for the massacre of the entire priestly family at Nob, "persons who wore a linen ephod", to the number of eighty-five persons, who were put to death by Doeg the Edomite. The sad tidings of the massacre were brought to David by Abiathar, a son of Ahimelech, the only one who escaped. Compare  Psalms 52 .  </p><p> Hearing that Keilah, a town on the western frontier, was harassed by the Philistines, David with his men relieved it ( 1 Samuel 23:1-14 ); and then, for fear of Saul, he fled to the strongholds in the "hill country" of Judah. Compare  Psalms 31 . While encamped there, in the forest in the district of Ziph, he was visited by Jonathan, who spoke to him words of encouragement ( 23:16-18 ). The two now parted never to meet again. Saul continued his pursuit of David, who narrowly escaped from him at this time, and fled to the crags and ravines of Engedi, on the western shore of the Dead Sea ( 1 Samuel 23:29 ). Here Saul, who still pursued him with his army, narrowly escaped, through the generous forbearance of David, and was greatly affected by what David had done for him. He returned home from pursuing him, and David betook himself to Maon, where, with his 600 men, he maintained himself by contributions gathered from the district. Here occurred the incident connected with Nabal and his wife Abigail ( 1 Samuel 25 ), whom David married after Nabal's death.  </p><p> Saul again went forth ( 1 Samuel 26 ) in pursuit of David, who had hid himself "in the hill Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon," in the wilderness of Ziph, and was a second time spared through his forbearance. He returned home, professing shame and penitence for the way in which he had treated David, and predicting his elevation to the throne.  </p><p> Fighting against Israel. Harassed by the necessity of moving from place to place through fear of Saul, David once more sought refuge among the Philistines ( 1 Samuel 27 ). He was welcomed by the king, who assigned him Ziklag as his residence. Here David lived among his followers for some time as an independent chief engaged in frequent war with the Amalekites and other tribes on the south of Judah.  </p><p> Achish summoned David with his men to join his army against Saul; but the lords of the Philistines were suspicious of David's loyalty, and therefore he was sent back to Ziklag, which he found to his dismay may had been pillaged and burnt during his brief absence. David pursued after the raiders, the Amalekites, and completely routed them. On his return to Ziklag tidings reached him of Saul's death (2Sam. 1). An Amalekite brought Saul's crown and bracelet and laid them at his feet. David and his men rent their clothes and mourned for Saul, who had been defeated in battle near Mount Gilboa. David composed a beautiful elegy, the most beautiful of all extant Hebrew odes, a "lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son" ( 2 Samuel 1:18-27 ). It bore the title of "The Bow," and was to be taught to the children, that the memory of Saul and Jonathan might be preserved among them. "Behold, it is written in the book of Jasher" (q.v.).  </p><p> David king over Judah. David and his men now set out for Hebron under divine direction ( 2 Samuel 2:1-4 ). There they were cordially welcomed, and he was at once anointed as king. He was now about thirty years of age.  </p><p> But his title to the throne was not undisputed. Abner took Ish-bosheth, Saul's only remaining son, over the Jordan to Mahanaim, and there crowned him as king. Then began a civil war in Israel. The first encounter between the two opposing armies, led on the one side by Abner, and on the other by Joab, took place at the pool of Gibeon. It resulted in the defeat of Abner. Other encounters, however, between Israel and Judah followed ( 2 Samuel 3:1 2 Samuel 3:5 ), but still success was on the side of David. For the space of seven and a half years David reigned in Hebron. Abner now sided with David, and sought to promote his advancement; but was treacherously put to death by Joab in revenge for his having slain his brother Asahel at Gibeon ( 3:22-39 ). This was greatly to David's regret. He mourned for the death of Abner. Shortly after this Ish-bosheth was also treacherously put to death by two Canaanites of Beeroth; and there being now no rival, David was anointed king over all Israel ( 4:1-12 ).  </p><p> David king over all Israel ( 2 Samuel 5:1-5 ;  1 Chronicles 11:1-3 ). The elders of Israel now repaired to Hebron and offered allegiance to David in name of all the people, among whom the greatest enthusiasm prevailed. He was anointed king over all Israel, and sought out a new seat of government, more suitable than Hebron, as the capital of his empire. At this time there was a Jebusite fortress, "the stronghold", on the hill of Zion, called also Jebus. This David took from the Jebusites, and made it Israel's capital, and established here his residence, and afterwards built for himself a palace by the aid of Tyrian tradesmen. The Philistines, who had for some time observed a kind of truce, now made war against David; but were defeated in battle at a place afterwards called, in remembrance of the victory, Baal-perazim. Again they invaded the land, and were a second time routed by him. He thus delivered Israel from their enemies.  </p><p> David now resolved to bring up the ark of the covenant to his new capital ( 2 Samuel 6 ). It was in the house of Abinadab at Kirjath-jearim, about 7 miles from Jerusalem, where it had been for many years, from the time when the Philistines had sent it home ( 1 Samuel 6 ;  7 ). In consequence of the death of Uzzah (for it was a divine ordinance that only the Levites should handle the ark,  Numbers 4 ), who had put forth his hand to steady the ark when the cart in which it was being conveyed shook by reason of the roughness of the road, David stayed the procession, and conveyed the ark into the house of Obed-edom, a Philistine from Gath. After three months David brought the ark from the house of Obed-edom up to Jerusalem. Compare  Psalms 24 . Here it was placed in a new tent or tabernacle which David erected for the purpose. About seventy years had passed since it had stood in the tabernacle at Shiloh. The old tabernacle was now at Gibeah, at which Zadok ministered. David now ( 1 Chronicles 16 ) carefully set in order all the ritual of divine worship at Jerusalem, along with Abiathar the high priest. A new religious era began. The service of praise was for the first time introduced into public worship. Zion became henceforth "God's holy hill."  </p><p> David's wars. David now entered on a series of conquests which greatly extended and strengthened his kingdom ( 2 Samuel 8 ). In a few years the whole territory from the Euphrates to the river of Egypt, and from Gaza on the west to Thapsacus on the east, was under his sway ( 2 Samuel 8:3-13 ;  10 ).  </p><p> David's fall. He had now reached the height of his glory. He ruled over a vast empire, and his capital was enriched with the spoils of many lands. But in the midst of all this success he fell, and his character became stained with the sin of adultery ( 2 Samuel 11:2-27 ). It has been noted as characteristic of the Bible that while his military triumphs are recorded in a few verses, the sad story of his fall is given in detail, a story full of warning, and therefore recorded. This crime, in the attempt to conceal it, led to anoter. He was guilty of murder. Uriah, whom he had foully wronged, an officer of the Gibborim, the corps of heros ( 23:39 ), was, by his order, "set in the front of the hottest battle" at the siege of Rabbah, in order that he might be put to death. Nathan the prophet ( 2 Samuel 7:1-17 ;  12:1-23 ) was sent by God to bring home his crimes to the conscience of the guilty monarch. He became a true penitent. He bitterly bewailed his sins before God. The thirty-second and fifty-first Psalms reveal the deep struggles of his soul, and his spiritual recovery.  </p><p> Bathsheba became his wife after Uriah's death. Her first-born son died, according to the word of the prophet. She gave birth to a second son, whom David called Solomon, and who ultimately succeeded him on the throne ( 2 Samuel 12:24 2 Samuel 12:25 ).  </p><p> Peace. After the successful termination of all his wars, David formed the idea of building a temple for the ark of God. This he was not permitted to carry into execution, because he had been a man of war. God, however, sent Nathan to him with a gracious message ( 2 Samuel 7:1-16 ). On receiving it he went into the sanctuary, the tent where the ark was, and sat before the Lord, and poured out his heart in words of devout thanksgiving (18-29). The building of the temple was reserved for his son Solomon, who would be a man of peace ( 1 Chronicles 22:9 ;  28:3 ).  </p><p> A cloudy evening. Hitherto David's carrer had been one of great prosperity and success. Now cloudy and dark days came. His eldest son Amnon, whose mother was Ahinoam of Jezreel, was guilty of a great and shameful crime ( 2 Samuel 13 ). This was the beginning of the disasters of his later years. After two years Absalom terribly avenged the crime against Tamar, and put Amnon to death. This brought sore trouble to David's heart. Absalom, afraid of the consequences of his guilt, fled to Geshur beyond Jordan, where he remained for three years, when he was brought back through the intrigue of Joab ( 2 Samuel 14 ).  </p><p> After this there fell upon the land the calamity of three years' famine ( 2 Samuel 21:1-14 ). This was soon after followed by a pestilence, brought upon the land as a punishment for David's sinful pride in numbering the people ( 2 Samuel 24 ), in which no fewer than 70,000 perished in the space of three days.  </p><p> Rebellion of Absalom. The personal respect for David was sadly lowered by the incident of Bathsheba. There was a strong popular sentiment against the taking of the census, and the outburst of the plague in connection with it deepened the feeling of jealously that had begun to manifest itself among some of the tribes against David. Absalom, taking full advantage of this state of things, gradually gained over the people, and at length openly rebelled against his father, and usurped the throne. Ahithophel was Absalom's chief counsellor. The revolt began in Hebron, the capital of Judah. Absalom was there proclaimed king. David was now in imminent danger, and he left Jerusalem ( 2 Samuel 15:13-20 ), and once more became a fugitive. It was a momentous day in Israel. The incidents of it are recorded with a fulness of detail greater than of any other day in Old Testament history. David fled with his followers to Mahanarm, on the east of Jordan. An unnatural civil war broke out. After a few weeks the rival armies were mustered and organized. They met in hostile array at the wood of Ephraim ( 2 Samuel 18:1-8 ). Absalom's army was defeated, and himself put to death by the hand of Joab (9-18). The tidings of the death of his rebellious son filled the heart of David with the most poignant grief. He "went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept" (33), giving utterance to the heart-broken cry, "Would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!" Peace was now restored, and David returned to Jerusalem and resumed the direction of affairs. An unhappy dispute arose between the men of Judah and the men of Israel ( 19:41-43 ). Sheba, a Benjamite, headed a revolt of the men of Israel. He was pursued to Abelbeth-maachah, and was there put to death, and so the revolt came to an end.  </p><p> The end. After the suppression of the rebellion of Absalom and that of Sheba, ten comparatively peaceful years of David's life passed away. During those years he seems to have been principally engaged in accumulating treasures of every kind for the great temple at Jerusalem, which it was reserved to his successor to build ( 1 Chronicles 22 ;  28 ;  29 ), a house which was to be "exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries" ( 22:5 ). The exciting and laborious life he had spent, and the dangers and trials through which he had passed, had left him an enfeebled man, prematurely old. It became apparent that his life was now drawing to its close. A new palace conspiracy broke out as to who should be his successor. Joab favoured Adonijah. The chiefs of his party met at the "Fuller's spring," in the valley of Kidron, to proclaim him king; but Nathan hastened on a decision on the part of David in favour of Solomon, and so the aim of Adonijah's party failed. Solomon was brought to Jerusalem, and was anointed king and seated on his father's throne ( 1 Kings 1:11-53 ). David's last words are a grand utterance, revealing his unfailing faith in God, and his joyful confidence in his gracious covenant promises ( 2 Samuel 23:1-7 ).  </p><p> After a reign of forty years and six months ( 2 Samuel 5:5 ;  1 Chronicles 3:4 ) David died (B.C. 1015) at the age of seventy years, "and was buried in the city of David." His tomb is still pointed out on Mount Zion.  </p><p> Both in his prophetical and in his regal character David was a type of the Messiah ( 1 Samuel 16:13 ). The book of Psalms commonly bears the title of the "Psalms of David," from the circumstance that he was the largest contributor (about eighty psalms) to the collection. (See PSALMS .) </p><p> "The greatness of David was felt when he was gone. He had lived in harmony with both the priesthood and the prophets; a sure sign that the spirit of his government had been throughly loyal to the higher aims of the theocracy. The nation had not been oppressed by him, but had been left in the free enjoyment of its ancient liberties. As far as his power went he had striven to act justly to all ( 2 Samuel 8:15 ). His weak indulgence to his sons, and his own great sin besides, had been bitterly atoned, and were forgotten at his death in the remembrance of his long-tried worth. He had reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem and seven and a half at Hebron ( 2 Samuel 5:5 ). Israel at his accession had reached the lowest point of national depression; its new-born unity rudely dissolved; its territory assailed by the Philistines. But he had left it an imperial power, with dominions like those of Egypt or Assyria. The sceptre of Solomon was already, before his father's death, owned from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates, and from the Orontes to the Red Sea.", Geikie's Hours etc., iii.  </p>
David, City of	<p></p><li> David took from the Jebusites the fortress of Mount Zion. He "dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David" ( 1 Chronicles 11:7 ). This was the name afterwards given to the castle and royal palace on Mount Zion, as distinguished from Jerusalem generally ( 1 Kings 3:1 ;  8:1 ), It was on the south-west side of Jerusalem, opposite the temple mount, with which it was connected by a bridge over the Tyropoeon valley.  <p> (2) Bethlehem is called the "city of David" ( Luke 2:4 Luke 2:11 ), because it was David's birth-place and early home ( 1 Samuel 17:12 ).  </p> </li>
Day	<p>The Jews reckoned the day from sunset to sunset ( Leviticus 23:32 ). It was originally divided into three parts ( Psalms 55:17 ). "The heat of the day" ( 1 Samuel 11:11 ;  Nehemiah 7:3 ) was at our nine o'clock, and "the cool of the day" just before sunset ( Genesis 3:8 ). Before the Captivity the Jews divided the night into three watches, (1) from sunset to midnight ( Lamentations 2:19 ); (2) from midnight till the cock-crowing ( Judges 7:19 ); and (3) from the cock-crowing till sunrise ( Exodus 14:24 ). In the New Testament the division of the Greeks and Romans into four watches was adopted ( Mark 13:35 ). (See WATCHES .) </p><p> The division of the day by hours is first mentioned in  Daniel 3:6 Daniel 3:15 ;  4:19 ;  5:5 . This mode of reckoning was borrowed from the Chaldeans. The reckoning of twelve hours was from sunrise to sunset, and accordingly the hours were of variable length ( John 11:9 ).  </p><p> The word "day" sometimes signifies an indefinite time ( Genesis 2:4 ;  Isaiah 22:5 ;  Hebrews 3:8 , etc.). In  Job 3:1  it denotes a birthday, and in  Isaiah 2:12 ,  Acts 17:31 , and  2 Timothy 1:18 , the great day of final judgment.  </p>
Days journey	<p>The usual length of a day's journey in the East, on camel or horseback, in six or eight hours, is about 25 or 30 miles. The "three days' journey" mentioned in  Exodus 3:18  is simply a journey which would occupy three days in going and returning.  </p>
Daysman	<p>an umpire or arbiter or judge ( Job 9:33 ). This word is formed from the Latin diem dicere, i.e., to fix a day for hearing a cause. Such an one is empowered by mutual consent to decide the cause, and to "lay his hand", i.e., to impose his authority, on both, and enforce his sentence.  </p>
Dayspring	<p>( Job 38:12 ;  Luke 1:78 ), the dawn of the morning; daybreak. (Compare  Isaiah 60:1 Isaiah 60:2 ;  Malachi 4:2 ;  Revelation 22:16 .)  </p>
Daystar	<p>which precedes and accompanies the sun-rising. It is found only in  2 Peter 1:19 , where it denotes the manifestation of Christ to the soul, imparting spiritual light and comfort. He is the "bright and morning star" of  Revelation 2:28 ;  22:16 . (Compare  Numbers 24:17 .)  </p>
Deacon	<p>Anglicized form of the Greek word diaconos, meaning a "runner," "messenger," "servant." For a long period a feeling of mutual jealousy had existed between the "Hebrews," or Jews proper, who spoke the sacred language of palestine, and the "Hellenists," or Jews of the Grecian speech, who had adopted the Grecian language, and read the Septuagint version of the Bible instead of the Hebrew. This jealousy early appeared in the Christian community. It was alleged by the Hellenists that their widows were overlooked in the daily distribution of alms. This spirit must be checked. The apostles accordingly advised the disciples to look out for seven men of good report, full of the Holy Ghost, and men of practical wisdom, who should take entire charge of this distribution, leaving them free to devote themselves entirely to the spiritual functions of their office ( Acts 6:1-6 ). This was accordingly done. Seven men were chosen, who appear from their names to have been Hellenists. The name "deacon" is nowhere applied to them in the New Testament; they are simply called "the seven" ( 21:8 ). Their office was at first secular, but it afterwards became also spiritual; for among other qualifications they must also be "apt to teach" ( 1 Timothy 3: :  <span class="badLink">812</span> -12). Both Philip and Stephen, who were of "the seven," preached; they did "the work of evangelists."  </p>
Deaconess	<p> Romans 16:1 Romans 16:3 Romans 16:12 ; Phil  Romans 4:2 Romans 4:3 ;  1 Timothy 3:11 ;  1 Timothy 5:9 1 Timothy 5:10 ;  Titus 2:3 Titus 2:4 ). In these passages it is evident that females were then engaged in various Christian ministrations. Pliny makes mention of them also in his letter to Trajan (A.D. 110).  </p>
Dead Sea	<p>the name given by Greek writers of the second century to that inland sea called in Scripture the "salt sea" ( Genesis 14:3 ;  Numbers 34:12 ), the "sea of the plain" ( Deuteronomy 3:17 ), the "east sea" ( Ezekiel 47:18 ;  Joel 2:20 ), and simply "the sea" ( Ezekiel 47:8 ). The Arabs call it Bahr Lut, i.e., the Sea of Lot. It lies about 16 miles in a straight line to the east of Jerusalem. Its surface is 1,292 feet below the surface of the Mediterranean Sea. It covers an area of about 300 square miles. Its depth varies from 1,310 to 11 feet. From various phenomena that have been observed, its bottom appears to be still subsiding. It is about 53 miles long, and of an average breadth of 10 miles. It has no outlet, the great heat of that region causing such rapid evaporation that its average depth, notwithstanding the rivers that run into it (see JORDAN), is maintained with little variation. The Jordan alone discharges into it no less than six million tons of water every twenty-four hours.  </p><p> The waters of the Dead Sea contain 24.6 per cent. of mineral salts, about seven times as much as in ordinary sea-water; thus they are unusually buoyant. Chloride of magnesium is most abundant; next to that chloride of sodium (common salt). But terraces of alluvial deposits in the deep valley of the Jordan show that formerly one great lake extended from the Waters of Merom to the foot of the watershed in the Arabah. The waters were then about 1,400 feet above the present level of the Dead Sea, or slightly above that of the Mediterranean, and at that time were much less salt.  </p><p> Nothing living can exist in this sea. "The fish carried down by the Jordan at once die, nor can even mussels or corals live in it; but it is a fable that no bird can fly over it, or that there are no living creatures on its banks. Dr. Tristram found on the shores three kinds of kingfishers, gulls, ducks, and grebes, which he says live on the fish which enter the sea in shoals, and presently die. He collected one hundred and eighteen species of birds, some new to science, on the shores, or swimming or flying over the waters. The cane-brakes which fringe it at some parts are the homes of about forty species of mammalia, several of them animals unknown in England; and innumerable tropical or semi-tropical plants perfume the atmosphere wherever fresh water can reach. The climate is perfect and most delicious, and indeed there is perhaps no place in the world where a sanatorium could be established with so much prospect of benefit as at Ain Jidi (Engedi).", Geikie's Hours, etc. </p>

Dearth	<p>a scarcity of provisions ( 1 Kings 17 ). There were frequent dearths in Palestine. In the days of Abram there was a "famine in the land" ( Genesis 12:10 ), so also in the days of Jacob ( Genesis 47:4 Genesis 47:13 ). We read also of dearths in the time of the judges ( Ruth 1:1 ), and of the kings ( 2 Samuel 21:1 ;  1 Kings 18:2 ;  2 Kings  4:38 ;  8:1 ).  </p><p> In New Testament times there was an extensive famine in Palestine ( Acts 11:28 ) in the fourth year of the reign of the emperor Claudius (A.D. 44 and 45).  </p>
Death	<p>may be simply defined as the termination of life. It is represented under a variety of aspects in Scripture: </p><li> "The dust shall return to the earth as it was" (Eccl  12:7 ).  </li><li> "Thou takest away their breath, they die" ( Psalms 104:29 ).  </li><li> It is the dissolution of "our earthly house of this tabernacle" ( 2 Corinthians 5:1 ); the "putting off this tabernacle" ( 2 Peter 1:13 2 Peter 1:14 ).  </li><li> Being "unclothed" ( 2 Corinthians 5:3 2 Corinthians 5:4 ).  </li><li> "Falling on sleep" ( Psalms 76:5 ;  Jeremiah 51:39 ;  Acts 13:36 ;  2 Pet  3:9 .  </li><li> "I go whence I shall not return" ( Job 10:21 ); "Make me to know mine end" ( Psalms 39:4 ); "to depart" (Phil  1:23 ).  <p> The grave is represented as "the gates of death" ( Job 38:17 ;  Psalms 9:13 ;  107:18 ). The gloomy silence of the grave is spoken of under the figure of the "shadow of death" ( Jeremiah 2:6 ).  </p><p> Death is the effect of sin ( Hebrews 2:14 ), and not a "debt of nature." It is but once ( 9:27 ), universal ( Genesis 3:19 ), necessary ( Luke 2:28-30 ). Jesus has by his own death taken away its sting for all his followers ( 1 Corinthians 15:55-57 ).  </p><p> There is a spiritual death in trespasses and sins, i.e., the death of the soul under the power of sin ( Romans 8:6 ;  Ephesians 2:1 Ephesians 2:3 ;  Colossians 2:13 ).  </p><p> The "second death" ( Revelation 2:11 ) is the everlasting perdition of the wicked ( Revelation 21:8 ), and "second" in respect to natural or temporal death.  </p><p> THE DEATH OF CHRIST is the procuring cause incidentally of all the blessings men enjoy on earth. But specially it is the procuring cause of the actual salvation of all his people, together with all the means that lead thereto. It does not make their salvation merely possible, but certain ( Matthew 18:11 ;  Romans 5:10 ;  2 co  5:21 ;  Galatians 1:4 ;  3:13 ;  Ephesians 1:7 ;  2:16 ;  Romans 8:32-35 ).  </p> </li>
Debir	<p>oracle town; sanctuary. </p><li> One of the eleven cities to the west of Hebron, in the highlands of Judah ( Joshua 15:49 ; Judg.  1:11-15 ). It was originally one of the towns of the Anakim ( Joshua 15:15 ), and was also called Kirjath-sepher (q.v.) and Kirjath-sannah (49). Caleb, who had conquered and taken possession of the town and district of Hebron ( Joshua 14:6-15 ), offered the hand of his daughter to any one who would successfully lead a party against Debir. Othniel, his younger brother ( Judges 1:13 ;  3:9 ), achieved the conquest, and gained Achsah as his wife. She was not satisfied with the portion her father gave her, and as she was proceeding toward her new home, she "lighted from off her ass" and said to him, "Give me a blessing [i.e., a dowry]: for thou hast given me a south land" ( Joshua 15:19 , A.V.); or, as in the Revised Version, "Thou hast set me in the land of the south", i.e., in the Negeb, outside the rich valley of Hebron, in the dry and barren land. "Give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs."  <p> Debir has been identified with the modern Edh-Dhaheriyeh, i.e., "the well on the ridge", to the south of Hebron. </p></li><li> A place near the "valley of Achor" ( Joshua 15:7 ), on the north boundary of Judah, between Jerusalem and Jericho.  </li><li> The king of Eglon, one of the five Canaanitish kings who were hanged by Joshua ( Joshua 10:3 Joshua 10:23 ) after the victory at Gibeon. These kings fled and took refuge in a cave at Makkedah. Here they were kept confined till Joshua returned from the pursuit of their discomfited armies, when he caused them to be brought forth, and "Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees" (26).   </li>
Deborah	<p>a bee. </p><li> Rebekah's nurse. She accompanied her mistress when she left her father's house in Padan-aram to become the wife of Isaac ( Genesis 24:59 ). Many years afterwards she died at Bethel, and was buried under the "oak of weeping", Allon-bachuth ( 35:8 ).  </li><li> A prophetess, "wife" (woman?) of Lapidoth. Jabin, the king of Hazor, had for twenty years held Israel in degrading subjection. The spirit of patriotism seemed crushed out of the nation. In this emergency Deborah roused the people from their lethargy. Her fame spread far and wide. She became a "mother in Israel" ( Judges 4:6 Judges 4:14 ;  5:7 ), and "the children of Israel came up to her for judgment" as she sat in her tent under the palm tree "between Ramah and Bethel." Preparations were everywhere made by her direction for the great effort to throw off the yoke of bondage. She summoned Barak from Kadesh to take the command of 10,000 men of Zebulun and Naphtali, and lead them to Mount Tabor on the plain of Esdraelon at its north-east end. With his aid she organized this army. She gave the signal for attack, and the Hebrew host rushed down impetuously upon the army of Jabin, which was commanded by Sisera, and gained a great and decisive victory. The Canaanitish army almost wholly perished. That was a great and ever-memorable day in Israel. In Judg. 5 is given the grand triumphal ode, the "song of Deborah," which she wrote in grateful commemoration of that great deliverance. (See LAPIDOTH, JABIN [2].)   </li>
Debt	<p>The Mosaic law encouraged the practice of lending ( Deuteronomy 15:7 ;  Psalms 37:26 ;  Matthew 5:42 ); but it forbade the exaction of interest except from foreigners. Usury was strongly condemned ( Proverbs 28:8 ;  Ezekiel 18:8 Ezekiel 18:13 Ezekiel 18:17 ;  22:12 ;  Psalms 15:5 ). On the Sabbatical year all pecuniary obligations were cancelled ( Deuteronomy 15:1-11 ). These regulations prevented the accumulation of debt.  </p>
Debtor	<p>Various regulations as to the relation between debtor and creditor are laid down in the Scriptures. </p><li> The debtor was to deliver up as a pledge to the creditor what he could most easily dispense with ( Deuteronomy 24:10 Deuteronomy 24:11 ).  </li><li> A mill, or millstone, or upper garment, when given as a pledge, could not be kept over night ( Exodus 22:26 Exodus 22:27 ).  </li><li> A debt could not be exacted during the Sabbatic year ( Deuteronomy 15:1-15 ).  <p> For other laws bearing on this relation see  Leviticus 25:14 Leviticus 25:32 Leviticus 25:39 ;  Matthew 18:25 Matthew 18:34 .  </p></li><li> A surety was liable in the same way as the original debtor ( Proverbs 11:15 ;  17:18 ).   </li>
Decalogue	<p>the name given by the Greek fathers to the ten commandments; "the ten words," as the original is more literally rendered ( Exodus 20:3-17 ). These commandments were at first written on two stone slabs ( 31:18 ), which were broken by Moses throwing them down on the ground ( 32:19 ). They were written by God a second time ( 34:1 ). The decalogue is alluded to in the New Testament five times ( Matthew 5:17 Matthew 5:18 Matthew 5:19 ;  Mark 10:19 ;  Luke 18:20 ;  Romans 7:7 Romans 7:8 ;  13:9 ;  1 Timothy 1:9 1 Timothy 1:10 ).  </p><p> These commandments have been divided since the days of Origen the Greek father, as they stand in the Confession of all the Reformed Churches except the Lutheran. The division adopted by Luther, and which has ever since been received in the Lutheran Church, makes the first two commandments one, and the third the second, and so on to the last, which is divided into two. "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house" being ranked as ninth, and "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife," etc., the tenth. (See COMMANDMENTS .) </p>
Decapolis	<p>ten cities=deka, ten, and polis, a city, a district on the east and south-east of the Sea of Galilee containing "ten cities," which were chiefly inhabited by Greeks. It included a portion of Bashan and Gilead, and is mentioned three times in the New Testament ( Matthew 4:25 ;  Mark 5:20 ;  7:31 ). These cities were Scythopolis, i.e., "city of the Scythians", (ancient Bethshean, the only one of the ten cities on the west of Jordan), Hippos, Gadara, Pella (to which the Christians fled just before the destruction of Jerusalem), Philadelphia (ancient Rabbath-ammon), Gerasa, Dion, Canatha, Raphana, and Damascus. When the Romans conquered Syria (B.C. 65) they rebuilt, and endowed with certain privileges, these "ten cities," and the province connected with them they called "Decapolis."  </p>
Decision, Valley of	<p>a name given to the valley of Jehoshaphat (q.v.) as the vale of the sentence. The scene of Jehovah's signal inflictions on Zion's enemies ( Joel 3:14 ; marg., "valley of concision or threshing").  </p>
Decrees of God	<p>"The decrees of God are his eternal, unchangeable, holy, wise, and sovereign purpose, comprehending at once all things that ever were or will be in their causes, conditions, successions, and relations, and determining their certain futurition. The several contents of this one eternal purpose are, because of the limitation of our faculties, necessarily conceived of by us in partial aspects, and in logical relations, and are therefore styled Decrees." The decree being the act of an infinite, absolute, eternal, unchangeable, and sovereign Person, comprehending a plan including all his works of all kinds, great and small, from the beginning of creation to an unending eternity; ends as well as means, causes as well as effects, conditions and instrumentalities as well as the events which depend upon them, must be incomprehensible by the finite intellect of man. The decrees are eternal ( Acts 15:18 ;  Ephesians 1:4 ;  2 th  2:13 ), unchangeable ( Psalms 33:11 ;  Isaiah 46:9 ), and comprehend all things that come to pass ( Ephesians 1:11 ;  Matthew 10:29 Matthew 10:30 ;  Ephesians 2:10 ;  Acts 2:23 ;  Acts 4:27 Acts 4:28 ;  Psalms 17:13 Psalms 17:14 ).  </p><p> The decrees of God are (1) efficacious, as they respect those events he has determined to bring about by his own immediate agency; or (2) permissive, as they respect those events he has determined that free agents shall be permitted by him to effect.  </p><p> This doctrine ought to produce in our minds "humility, in view of the infinite greatness and sovereignty of God, and of the dependence of man; confidence and implicit reliance upon wisdom, rightenousness, goodness, and immutability of God's purpose." </p>
Dedan	<p>low ground. </p><li> A son of Raamah ( Genesis 10:7 ). His descendants are mentioned in  Isaiah 21:13 , and  Ezekiel 27:15 . They probably settled among the sons of Cush, on the north-west coast of the Persian Gulf.  </li><li> A son of Jokshan, Abraham's son by Keturah ( 1 Chronicles 1:32 ). His descendants settled on the Syrian borders about the territory of Edom. They probably led a pastoral life.   </li>
Dedanim	<p>the descendants of Dedan, the son of Raamah. They are mentioned in  Isaiah 21:13  as sending out "travelling companies" which lodged "in the forest of Arabia." They are enumerated also by ( Ezekiel 27:20 ) among the merchants who supplied Tyre with precious things.  </p>
Dedication, Feast of the	<p>( John 10:22 John 10:42 ), i.e., the feast of the renewing. It was instituted B.C. 164 to commemorate the purging of the temple after its pollution by Antiochus Epiphanes (B.C. 167), and the rebuilding of the altar after the Syrian invaders had been driven out by Judas Maccabaeus. It lasted for eight days, beginning on the 25th of the month Chisleu (December), which was often a period of heavy rains ( Ezra 10:9 Ezra 10:13 ). It was an occasion of much rejoicing and festivity.  </p><p> But there were other dedications of the temple. (1) That of Solomon's temple ( 1 Kings 8:2 ;  2 Chr  5:3 ); (2) the dedication in the days of Hezekiah ( 2 Chronicles 29 ); and (3) the dedication of the temple after the Captivity ( Ezra 6:16 ).  </p>
Deep	<p>used to denote (1) the grave or the abyss ( Romans 10:7 ;  Luke 8:31 ); (2) the deepest part of the sea ( Psalms 69:15 ); (3) the chaos mentioned in  Genesis 1:2 ; (4) the bottomless pit, hell ( Revelation 9:1 Revelation 9:2 ;  11:7 ;  20:13 ).  </p>
Degrees, Song of	<p>song of steps, a title given to each of these fifteen psalms, 120-134 inclusive. The probable origin of this name is the circumstance that these psalms came to be sung by the people on the ascents or goings up to Jerusalem to attend the three great festivals ( Deuteronomy 16:16 ). They were well fitted for being sung by the way from their peculiar form, and from the sentiments they express. "They are characterized by brevity, by a key-word, by epanaphora [i.e, repetition], and by their epigrammatic style...More than half of them are cheerful, and all of them hopeful." They are sometimes called "Pilgrim Songs." Four of them were written by David, one (127) by Solomon, and the rest are anonymous.  </p>
Dehavites	<p>villagers, one of the Assyrian tribes which Asnapper sent to repopulate Samaria ( Ezra 4:9 ). They were probably a nomad Persian tribe on the east of the Caspian Sea, and near the Sea of Azof.  </p>
Delaiah	<p>freed by Jehovah. </p><li> The head of the twenty-third division of the priestly order ( 1 Chronicles 24:18 ).  </li><li> A son of Shemaiah, and one of the courtiers to whom Jeremiah's first roll of prophecy was read ( Jeremiah 36:12 ).  </li><li> The head of one of the bands of exiles that returned under Zerubbabel to Jerusalem ( Ezra 2:60 ;  Nehemiah 7:62 ).   </li>
Delilah	<p>languishing, a Philistine woman who dwelt in the valley of Sorek ( Judges 16:4-20 ). She was bribed by the "lords of the Philistines" to obtain from Samson the secret of his strength and the means of overcoming it ( Judges 16:4-18 ). She tried on three occasions to obtain from him this secret in vain. On the fourth occasion she wrung it from him. She made him sleep upon her knees, and then called the man who was waiting to help her; who "cut off the seven locks of his head," and so his "strength went from him." (See SAMSON .) </p>
Deluge	<p>the name given to Noah's flood, the history of which is recorded in  Genesis 7  and 8.  </p><p> It began in the year 2516 B.C., and continued twelve lunar months and ten days, or exactly one solar year.  </p><p> The cause of this judgment was the corruption and violence that filled the earth in the ninth generation from Adam. God in righteous indignation determined to purge the earth of the ungodly race. Amid a world of crime and guilt there was one household that continued faithful and true to God, the household of Noah. "Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations." </p><p> At the command of God, Noah made an ark 300 cubits long, 50 broad, and 30 high. He slowly proceeded with this work during a period of one hundred and twenty years ( Genesis 6:3 ). At length the purpose of God began to be carried into effect. The following table exhibits the order of events as they occurred:  </p><p> In the six hundredth year of his life Noah is commanded by God to enter the ark, taking with him his wife, and his three sons with their wives ( Genesis 7:1-10 ).  </p><p> The rain begins on the seventeenth day of the second month ( Genesis 7:11-17 ).  </p><p> The rain ceases, the waters prevail, fifteen cubits upward ( Genesis 7:18-24 ).  </p><p> The ark grounds on one of the mountains of Ararat on the seventeenth day of the seventh month, or one hundred and fifty days after the Deluge began ( Genesis 8:1-4 ).  </p><p> Tops of the mountains visible on the first day of the tenth month ( Genesis 8:5 ).  </p><p> Raven and dove sent out forty days after this ( Genesis 8:6-9 ).  </p><p> Dove again sent out seven days afterwards; and in the evening she returns with an olive leaf in her mouth ( Genesis 8:10 Genesis 8:11 ).  </p><p> Dove sent out the third time after an interval of other seven days, and returns no more ( Genesis 8:12 ).  </p><p> The ground becomes dry on the first day of the first month of the new year ( Genesis 8:13 ).  </p><p> Noah leaves the ark on the twenty-seventh day of the second month ( Genesis 8:14-19 ).  </p><p> The historical truth of the narrative of the Flood is established by the references made to it by our Lord ( Matthew 24:37 ; Compare  Luke 17:26 ). Peter speaks of it also ( 1 Peter 3:20 ;  2 Pet  2:5 ). In  Isaiah 54:9  the Flood is referred to as "the waters of Noah." The Biblical narrative clearly shows that so far as the human race was concerned the Deluge was universal; that it swept away all men living except Noah and his family, who were preserved in the ark; and that the present human race is descended from those who were thus preserved.  </p><p> Traditions of the Deluge are found among all the great divisions of the human family; and these traditions, taken as a whole, wonderfully agree with the Biblical narrative, and agree with it in such a way as to lead to the conclusion that the Biblical is the authentic narrative, of which all these traditions are more or less corrupted versions. The most remarkable of these traditions is that recorded on tablets prepared by order of Assur-bani-pal, the king of Assyria. These were, however, copies of older records which belonged to somewhere about B.C. 2000, and which formed part of the priestly library at Erech (q.v.), "the ineradicable remembrance of a real and terrible event." (See NOAH;  CHALDEA .) </p>
Demas	<p>a companion and fellow-labourer of Paul during his first imprisonment at Rome ( Philemon 1:24 ;  Colossians 4:14 ). It appears, however, that the love of the world afterwards mastered him, and he deserted the apostle ( 2 Timothy 4:10 ).  </p>
Demetrius	<p></p><li> A silversmith at Ephesus, whose chief occupation was to make "silver shrines for Diana" (q.v.), Acts 19:24,i.e., models either of the temple of Diana or of the statue of the goddess. This trade brought to him and his fellow-craftsmen "no small gain," for these shrines found a ready sale among the countless thousands who came to this temple from all parts of Asia Minor. This traffic was greatly endangered by the progress of the gospel, and hence Demetrius excited the tradesmen employed in the manufacture of these shrines, and caused so great a tumult that "the whole city was filled with confusion."  </li><li> A Christian who is spoken of as having "a good report of all men, and of the truth itself" ( 3 John 1:12 ).   </li>
Demon	<p>See DAEMON . </p>
Den	<p>a lair of wild beasts ( Psalms 10:9 ;  104:22 ;  Job 37:8 ); the hole of a venomous reptile ( Isaiah 11:8 ); a recess for secrecy "in dens and caves of the earth" ( Hebrews 11:38 ); a resort of thieves ( Matthew 21:13 ;  Mark 11:17 ). Daniel was cast into "the den of lions" ( Daniel 6:16 Daniel 6:17 ). Some recent discoveries among the ruins of Babylon have brought to light the fact that the practice of punishing offenders against the law by throwing them into a den of lions was common.  </p>
Deputy	<p>in  1 Kings 22:47 , means a prefect; one set over others. The same Hebrew word is rendered "officer;" i.e., chief of the commissariat appointed by Solomon ( 1 Kings 4:5 , etc.).  </p><p> In  Esther 8:9 ;  9:3  (RSV, "governor") it denotes a Persian prefect "on this side" i.e., in the region west of the Euphrates. It is the modern word <i> pasha</i> . </p><p> In  Acts 13:7 Acts 13:8 Acts 13:12 ;  18:12 , it denotes a proconsul; i.e., the governor of a Roman province holding his appointment from the senate. The Roman provinces were of two kinds, (1) senatorial and (2) imperial. The appointment of a governor to the former was in the hands of the senate, and he bore the title of proconsul (Gr. anthupatos). The appointment of a governor to the latter was in the hands of the emperor, and he bore the title of propraetor (Gr. antistrategos).  </p>
Derbe	<p>a small town on the eastern part of the upland plain of Lycaonia, about 20 miles from Lystra. Paul passed through Derbe on his route from Cilicia to Iconium, on his second missionary journey ( Acts 16:1 ), and probably also on his third journey ( 18:23 ;  19:1 ). On his first journey ( Acts 14:20 Acts 14:21 ) he came to Derbe from the other side; i.e., from Iconium. It was the native place of Gaius, one of Paul's companions ( 20:4 ). He did not here suffer persecution ( 2 Timothy 3:11 ).  </p>
Desert	<p></p><li> Heb. midbar, "pasture-ground;" an open tract for pasturage; a common ( Joel 2:22 ). The "backside of the desert" ( Exodus 3:1 ) is the west of the desert, the region behind a man, as the east is the region in front. The same Hebrew word is rendered "wildernes," and is used of the country lying between Egypt and Palestine ( Genesis 21:14 Genesis 21:21 ;  Exodus 4:27 ;  19:2 ;  Joshua 1:4 ), the wilderness of the wanderings. It was a grazing tract, where the flocks and herds of the Israelites found pasturage during the whole of their journey to the Promised Land.  <p> The same Hebrew word is used also to denote the wilderness of Arabia, which in winter and early spring supplies good pasturage to the flocks of the nomad tribes than roam over it ( 1 Kings 9:18 ).  </p><p> The wilderness of Judah is the mountainous region along the western shore of the Dead Sea, where David fed his father's flocks ( 1 Samuel 17:28 ;  26:2 ). Thus in both of these instances the word denotes a country without settled inhabitants and without streams of water, but having good pasturage for cattle; a country of wandering tribes, as distinguished from that of a settled people ( Isaiah 35:1 ;  50:2 ;  Jeremiah 4:11 ). Such, also, is the meaning of the word "wilderness" in  Matthew 3:3 ;  15:33 ;  Luke 15:4 .  </p></li><li> The translation of the Hebrew <i> Aribah'</i> , "an arid tract" ( Isaiah 35:1 Isaiah 35:6 ;  40:3 ;  41:19 ;  51:3 , etc.). The name Arabah is specially applied to the deep valley of the Jordan (the Ghor of the Arabs), which extends from the lake of Tiberias to the Elanitic gulf. While <i> midbar</i> denotes properly a pastoral region, <i> arabah</i> denotes a wilderness. It is also translated "plains;" as "the plains of Jericho" ( Joshua 5:10 ;  2 Kings  <span class="badLink">25:5</span> ), "the plains of Moab" ( Numbers 22:1 ;  Deuteronomy 34:1 Deuteronomy 34:8 ), "the plains of the wilderness" ( 2 Samuel 17:16 ).  </li><li> In the Revised Version of  Numbers 21:20  the Hebrew word <i> jeshimon</i> is properly rendered "desert," meaning the waste tracts on both shores of the Dead Sea. This word is also rendered "desert" in  Psalms 78:40 ;  106:14 ;  Isaiah 43:19 Isaiah 43:20 . It denotes a greater extent of uncultivated country than the other words so rendered. It is especially applied to the desert of the peninsula of Arabia ( Numbers 21:20 ;  23:28 ), the most terrible of all the deserts with which the Israelites were acquainted. It is called "the desert" in  Exodus 23:31 ;  Deuteronomy 11:24 . (See JESHIMON .) </li><li> A dry place; hence a desolation ( Psalms 9:6 ), desolate ( Leviticus 26:34 ); the rendering of the Hebrew word <i> horbah'</i> . It is rendered "desert" only in  Psalms 102:6 ,  Isaiah 48:21 , and  Ezekiel 13:4 , where it means the wilderness of Sinai.  </li><li> This word is the symbol of the Jewish church when they had forsaken God ( Isaiah 40:3 ). Nations destitute of the knowledge of God are called a "wilderness" ( 32:15 , <i> midbar</i> ). It is a symbol of temptation, solitude, and persecution ( Isaiah 27:10 , <i> midbar_;  33:9 , _arabah</i> ).  </li>
Desire of all nations	<p>( Haggai 2:7 ), usually interpreted as a title of the Messiah. The Revised Version, however, more correctly renders "the desirable things of all nations;" i.e., the choicest treasures of the Gentiles shall be consecrated to the Lord.  </p>
Desolation, Abomination of	<p>( Matthew 24:15 ;  Mark 13:14 ; Compare  Luke 21:20 ), is interpreted of the eagles, the standards of the Roman army, which were an abomination to the Jews. These standards, rising over the site of the temple, were a sign that the holy place had fallen under the idolatrous Romans. The references are to  Daniel 9:27 . (See ABOMINATION .) </p>
Destroyer	<p>( Exodus 12:23 ), the agent employed in the killing of the first-born; the destroying angel or messenger of God. (Compare  2 Kings 19:35 ;  2 Sam  2 Kings 24:15 2 Kings 24:16 ;  Psalms 78:49 ;  Acts 12:23 .)  </p>
Destruction	<p>in  Job 26:6 Job 28:22  (Heb. abaddon) is sheol, the realm of the dead.  </p>
Destruction, City of	<p>( Isaiah 19:18 ; Heb. Ir-ha-Heres, "city of overthrow," because of the evidence it would present of the overthrow of heathenism), the ideal title of On or Heliopolis (q.v.).  </p>
Deuteronomy	<p>In all the Hebrew manuscripts the Pentateuch (q.v.) forms one roll or volume divided into larger and smaller sections called <i> parshioth_ and _sedarim</i> . It is not easy to say when it was divided into five books. This was probably first done by the Greek translators of the book, whom the Vulgate follows. The fifth of these books was called by the Greeks Deuteronomion, i.e., the second law, hence our name Deuteronomy, or a second statement of the laws already promulgated. The Jews designated the book by the two first Hebrew words that occur, _'Elle haddabharim_, i.e., "These are the words." They divided it into eleven <i> parshioth</i> . In the English Bible it contains thirty-four chapters. </p><p> It consists chiefly of three discourses delivered by Moses a short time before his death. They were spoken to all Israel in the plains of Moab, in the eleventh month of the last year of their wanderings. </p><p> The first discourse ( (1-4:40) ) recapitulates the chief events of the last forty years in the wilderness, with earnest exhortations to obedience to the divine ordinances, and warnings against the danger of forsaking the God of their fathers.  </p><p> The seond discourse ( (5-26:19) ) is in effect the body of the whole book. The first address is introductory to it. It contains practically a recapitulation of the law already given by God at Mount Sinai, together with many admonitions and injunctions as to the course of conduct they were to follow when they were settled in Canaan.  </p><p> The concluding discourse (ch. 27-30) relates almost wholly to the solemn sanctions of the law, the blessings to the obedient, and the curse that would fall on the rebellious. He solemnly adjures them to adhere faithfully to the covenant God had made with them, and so secure for themselves and their posterity the promised blessings.  </p><p> These addresses to the people are followed by what may be called three appendices, namely (1), a song which God had commanded Moses to write ( 32:1-47 ); (2) the blessings he pronounced on the separate tribes (ch. 33); and (3) the story of his death ( 32:48-52 ) and burial (ch. 34), written by some other hand, probably that of Joshua.  </p><p> These farewell addresses of Moses to the tribes of Israel he had so long led in the wilderness "glow in each line with the emotions of a great leader recounting to his contemporaries the marvellous story of their common experience. The enthusiasm they kindle, even to-day, though obscured by translation, reveals their matchless adaptation to the circumstances under which they were first spoken. Confidence for the future is evoked by remembrance of the past. The same God who had done mighty works for the tribes since the Exodus would cover their head in the day of battle with the nations of Palestine, soon to be invaded. Their great lawgiver stands before us, vigorous in his hoary age, stern in his abhorrence of evil, earnest in his zeal for God, but mellowed in all relations to earth by his nearness to heaven. The commanding wisdom of his enactments, the dignity of his position as the founder of the nation and the first of prophets, enforce his utterances. But he touches our deepest emotions by the human tenderness that breathes in all his words. Standing on the verge of life, he speaks as a father giving his parting counsels to those he loves; willing to depart and be with God he has served so well, but fondly lengthening out his last farewell to the dear ones of earth. No book can compare with Deuteronomy in its mingled sublimity and tenderness." Geikie, Hours, etc. </p><p> The whole style and method of this book, its tone and its peculiarities of conception and expression, show that it must have come from one hand. That the author was none other than Moses is established by the following considerations: </p><li> The uniform tradition both of the Jewish and the Christian Church down to recent times. </li><li> The book professes to have been written by Moses ( 1:1 ;  29:1 ;  Isaiah 31:1 Isaiah 31:9-11 , etc.), and was obviously intended to be accepted as his work. </li><li> The incontrovertible testimony of our Lord and his apostles ( Matthew 19:7 Matthew 19:8 ;  Mark 10:3 Mark 10:4 ;  John 5:46 John 5:47 ;  Acts 3:22 ;  7:37 ;  Romans 10:19 ) establishes the same conclusion. </li><li> The frequent references to it in the later books of the canon ( Joshua 8:31 ;  1 Kings 2:9 ;  2 Kings  14:6 ;  2 Chr  23:18 ;  25:4 ;  34:14 ;  Ezra 3:2 ;  7:6 ;  Nehemiah 8:1 ;  Daniel 9:11 Daniel 9:13 ) prove its antiquity; and (5) the archaisms found in it are in harmony with the age in which Moses lived. </li><li> Its style and allusions are also strikingly consistent with the circumstances and position of Moses and of the people at that time.  <p> This body of positive evidence cannot be set aside by the conjectures and reasonings of modern critics, who contended that the book was somewhat like a forgery, introduced among the Jews some seven or eight centuries after the Exodus. </p> </li>
Devil	<p>(Gr. diabolos), a slanderer, the arch-enemy of man's spiritual interest ( Job 1:6 ;  Revelation 2:10 ;  Zechariah 3:1 ). He is called also "the accuser of the brethen" ( Revelation 12:10 ).  </p><p> In  Leviticus 17:7  the word "devil" is the translation of the Hebrew <i> sair</i> , meaning a "goat" or "satyr" ( Isaiah 13:21 ;  34:14 ), alluding to the wood-daemons, the objects of idolatrous worship among the heathen.  </p><p> In  Deuteronomy 32:17  and  Psalms 106:37  it is the translation of Hebrew <i> shed</i> , meaning lord, and idol, regarded by the Jews as a "demon," as the word is rendered in the Revised Version. </p><p> In the narratives of the Gospels regarding the "casting out of devils" a different Greek word (daimon) is used. In the time of our Lord there were frequent cases of demoniacal possession ( Matthew 12:25-30 ;  Mark 5:1-20 ;  Luke 4:35 ;  10:18 , etc.).  </p>
Dew	<p>"There is no dew properly so called in Palestine, for there is no moisture in the hot summer air to be chilled into dew-drops by the coldness of the night. From May till October rain is unknown, the sun shining with unclouded brightness day after day. The heat becomes intense, the ground hard, and vegetation would perish but for the moist west winds that come each night from the sea. The bright skies cause the heat of the day to radiate very quickly into space, so that the nights are as cold as the day is the reverse, a peculiarity of climate from which poor Jacob suffered thousands of years ago ( Genesis 31:40 ). To this coldness of the night air the indispensable watering of all plant-life is due. The winds, loaded with moisture, are robbed of it as they pass over the land, the cold air condensing it into drops of water, which fall in a gracious rain of mist on every thirsty blade. In the morning the fog thus created rests like a sea over the plains, and far up the sides of the hills, which raise their heads above it like so many islands. At sunrise, however, the scene speedily changes. By the kindling light the mist is transformed into vast snow-white clouds, which presently break into separate masses and rise up the mountain-sides, to disappear in the blue above, dissipated by the increasing heat. These are 'the morning clouds and the early dew that go away' of which ( Hosea 6:4 ;  13:3 ) speaks so touchingly" (Geikie's The Holy Land, etc., i., p. 72). Dew is a source of great fertility ( Genesis 27:28 ;  Deuteronomy 33:13 ;  Zechariah 8:12 ), and its withdrawal is regarded as a curse from God ( 2 Samuel 1:21 ;  1 Kings 17:1 ). It is the symbol of a multitude ( 2 Samuel 17:12 ;  Psalms 110:3 ); and from its refreshing influence it is an emblem of brotherly love and harmony ( Psalms 133:3 ), and of rich spiritual blessings ( Hosea 14:5 ).  </p>
Diadem	<p>the tiara of a king ( Ezekiel 21:26 ;  Isaiah 28:5 ;  62:3 ); the turban ( Job 29:14 ). In the New Testament a careful distinction is drawn between the diadem as a badge of royalty ( Revelation 12:3 ;  13:1 ;  19:12 ) and the crown as a mark of distinction in private life. It is not known what the ancient Jewish "diadem" was. It was the mark of Oriental sovereigns. (See CROWN .) </p>
Eagle	<p>(Herb. nesher; properly the griffon vulture or great vulture, so called from its tearing its prey with its beak), referred to for its swiftness of flight ( Deuteronomy 28:49 ;  2 Sam  1:23 ), its mounting high in the air ( Job 39:27 ), its strength ( Psalms 103:5 ), its setting its nest in high places ( Jeremiah 49:16 ), and its power of vision ( Job 39:27-30 ).  </p><p> This "ravenous bird" is a symbol of those nations whom God employs and sends forth to do a work of destruction, sweeping away whatever is decaying and putrescent ( Matthew 24:28 ;  Isaiah 46:11 ;  Ezekiel 39:4 ;  Deuteronomy 28:49 ;  Jeremiah 4:13 ;  48:40 ). It is said that the eagle sheds his feathers in the beginning of spring, and with fresh plumage assumes the appearance of youth. To this, allusion is made in  Psalms 103:5  and  Isaiah 40:31 . God's care over his people is likened to that of the eagle in training its young to fly ( Exodus 19:4 ;  Deuteronomy 32:11 Deuteronomy 32:12 ). An interesting illustration is thus recorded by Sir Humphry Davy:, "I once saw a very interesting sight above the crags of Ben Nevis. Two parent eagles were teaching their offspring, two young birds, the maneuvers of flight. They began by rising from the top of the mountain in the eye of the sun. It was about mid-day, and bright for the climate. They at first made small circles, and the young birds imitated them. They paused on their wings, waiting till they had made their flight, and then took a second and larger gyration, always rising toward the sun, and enlarging their circle of flight so as to make a gradually ascending spiral. The young ones still and slowly followed, apparently flying better as they mounted; and they continued this sublime exercise, always rising till they became mere points in the air, and the young ones were lost, and afterwards their parents, to our aching sight." (See   Isaiah 40:31 .)  </p><p> There have been observed in Palestine four distinct species of eagles, (1) the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos); (2) the spotted eagle (Aquila naevia); (3) the common species, the imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca); and (4) the Circaetos gallicus, which preys on reptiles. The eagle was unclean by the Levitical law ( Leviticus 11:13 ;  Deuteronomy 14:12 ).  </p>
Ear	<p>used frequently in a figurative sense ( Psalms 34:15 ). To "uncover the ear" is to show respect to a person ( 1 Samuel 20:2  marg.). To have the "ear heavy", or to have "uncircumcised ears" ( Isaiah 6:10 ), is to be inattentive and disobedient. To have the ear "bored" through with an awl was a sign of perpetual servitude ( Exodus 21:6 ).  </p>
Earing	<p>an Old English word (from the Latin aro, I plough), meaning "ploughing." It is used in the Authorized Version in  Genesis 45:6 ;  Exodus 34:21 ;  1 Samuel 8:12 ;  Deuteronomy 21:4 ;  Isaiah 30:24 ; but the Revised Version has rendered the original in these places by the ordinary word to plough or till.  </p>
Earnest	<p>The Spirit is the earnest of the believer's destined inheritance ( 2 Corinthians 1:22 ;  5:5 ;  Ephesians 1:14 ). The word thus rendered is the same as that rendered "pledge" in  Genesis 38:17-20 ; "indeed, the Hebrew word has simply passed into the Greek and Latin languages, probably through commercial dealings with the Phoenicians, the great trading people of ancient days. Originally it meant no more than a pledge; but in common usage it came to denote that particular kind of pledge which is a part of the full price of an article paid in advance; and as it is joined with the figure of a seal when applied to the Spirit, it seems to be used by Paul in this specific sense." The Spirit's gracious presence and working in believers is a foretaste to them of the blessedness of heaven. God is graciously pleased to give not only pledges but foretastes of future blessedness.  </p>
Earrings	<p>rings properly for the ear ( Genesis 35:4 ;  Numbers 31:50 ;  Ezekiel 16:12 ). In  Genesis 24:47  the word means a nose-jewel, and is so rendered in the Revised Version. In  Isaiah 3:20  the Authorized Version has "ear-rings," and the Revised Version "amulets," which more correctly represents the original word (lehashim), which means incantations; charms, thus remedies against enchantment, worn either suspended from the neck or in the ears of females. Ear-rings were ornaments used by both sexes ( Exodus 32:2 ).  </p>
Earth	<p></p><li> In the sense of soil or ground, the translation of the word <i> adamah'</i> . In  Genesis 9:20  "husbandman" is literally "man of the ground or earth." Altars were to be built of earth ( Exodus 20:24 ). Naaman asked for two mules' burden of earth ( 2 Kings 5:17 ), under the superstitious notion that Jehovah, like the gods of the heathen, could be acceptably worshipped only on his own soil.  <p> (2). As the rendering of <i> 'erets</i> , it means the whole world ( Genesis 1:2 ); the land as opposed to the sea ( 1:10 ). <i> Erets</i> also denotes a country ( 21:32 ); a plot of ground ( 23:15 ); the ground on which a man stands ( 33:3 ); the inhabitants of the earth ( 6:1 ;  11:1 ); all the world except Israel ( 2 Chronicles 13:9 ). In the New Testament "the earth" denotes the land of Judea ( Matthew 23:35 ); also things carnal in contrast with things heavenly ( John 3:31 ;  Colossians 3:1 Colossians 3:2 ).  </p> </li>
Earthquake	<p>mentioned among the extraordinary phenomena of Palestine ( Psalms 18:7 ; Compare  Habakkuk 3:6 ;  Nahum 1:5 ;  Isaiah 5:25 ).  </p><p> The first earthquake in Palestine of which we have any record happened in the reign of Ahab ( 1 Kings 19:11 1 Kings 19:12 ). Another took place in the days of Uzziah, King of Judah ( Zechariah 14:5 ). The most memorable earthquake taking place in New Testament times happened at the crucifixion of our Lord ( Matthew 27:54 ). An earthquake at Philippi shook the prison in which Paul and Silas were imprisoned (Act  16:26 ).  </p><p> It is used figuratively as a token of the presence of the Lord ( Judges 5:4 ;  2 Sam  <span class="badLink">22:8</span> ;  Psalms 77:18 ;  97:4 ;  104:32 ).  </p>
East	<p></p><li> The orient (mizrah); the rising of the sun. Thus "the east country" is the country lying to the east of Syria, the Elymais ( Zechariah 8:7 ).  <p> (2). Properly what is in front of one, or a country that is before or in front of another; the rendering of the word <i> kedem</i> . In pointing out the quarters, a Hebrew always looked with his face toward the east. The word <i> kedem</i> is used when the four quarters of the world are described ( Genesis 13:14 ;  28:14 ); and <i> mizrah</i> when the east only is distinguished from the west ( Joshua 11:3 ;  Psalms 50:1 ;  103:12 , etc.). In  Genesis 25:6  "eastward" is literally "unto the land of kedem;" i.e., the lands lying east of Palestine, namely, Arabia, Mesopotamia, etc.  </p> </li>
East gate	<p>( Jeremiah 19:2 ), properly the Potter's gate, the gate which led to the potter's field, in the valley of Hinnom.  </p>
East sea	<p>( Joel 2:20 ;  Ezekiel 47:18 ), the Dead Sea, which lay on the east side of the Holy Land. The Mediterranean, which lay on the west, was hence called the "great sea for the west border" ( Numbers 34:6 ).  </p>
East wind	<p>the wind coming from the east ( Job 27:21 ;  Isaiah 27:8 , etc.). Blight caused by this wind, "thin ears" ( Genesis 41:6 ); the withered "gourd" ( Jonah 4: :  8 ). It was the cause and also the emblem of evil ( Ezekiel 17:10 ;  19:12 ;  Hosea 13:15 ). In Palestine this wind blows from a burning desert, and hence is destitute of moisture necessary for vegetation.  </p>
East, Children of the	<p>the Arabs as a whole, known as the Nabateans or Kedarenes, nomad tribes ( Judges 6:3 Judges 6:33 ;  7:12 ;  8:10 ).  </p>
Easter	<p>originally a Saxon word (Eostre), denoting a goddess of the Saxons, in honour of whom sacrifices were offered about the time of the Passover. Hence the name came to be given to the festival of the Resurrection of Christ, which occured at the time of the Passover. In the early English versions this word was frequently used as the translation of the Greek pascha (the Passover). When the Authorized Version (1611) was formed, the word "passover" was used in all passages in which this word pascha occurred, except in Act  12:4 . In the Revised Version the proper word, "passover," is always used.  </p>
Eating	<p>The ancient Hebrews would not eat with the Egyptians ( Genesis 43:32 ). In the time of our Lord they would not eat with Samaritans ( John 4:9 ), and were astonished that he ate with publicans and sinners ( Matthew 9:11 ). The Hebrews originally sat at table, but afterwards adopted the Persian and Chaldean practice of reclining ( Luke 7:36-50 ). Their principal meal was at noon ( Genesis 43:16 ;  1 Kings 20:16 ;  Ruth 2:14 ;  Luke 14:12 ). The word "eat" is used metaphorically in  Jeremiah 15:16 ;  Ezekiel 3:1 ;  Revelation 10:9 . In  John 6:53-58 , "eating and drinking" means believing in Christ. Women were never present as guests at meals (q.v.).  </p>
Ebal	<p>stony. </p><li> A mountain 3,076 feet above the level of the sea, and 1,200 feet above the level of the valley, on the north side of which stood the city of Shechem (q.v.). On this mountain six of the tribes ( Deuteronomy 27:12 Deuteronomy 27:13 ) were appointed to take their stand and respond according to a prescribed form to the imprecations uttered in the valley, where the law was read by the Levites ( 11:29 ;  Deuteronomy 29:4 Deuteronomy 29:13 ). This mountain was also the site of the first great altar erected to Jehovah ( Deuteronomy 27:5-8 ;  Joshua 8:30-35 ). After this the name of Ebal does not again occur in Jewish history. (See GERIZIM .) </li><li> A descendant of Eber ( 1 Chronicles 1:22 ), called also Obal ( Genesis 10:28 ).  </li><li> A descendant of Seir the Horite ( Genesis 36:23 ).   </li>
Ebed	<p>slave, the father of Gaal, in whom the men of Shechem "put confidence" in their conspiracy against Abimelech ( Judges 9:26 Judges 9:26 Judges 9:30 Judges 9:31 ).  </p>
Ebed-melech	<p>a servant of the king; probably an official title, an Ethiopian, "one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house;" i.e., in the palace of Zedekiah, king of Judah. He interceded with the king in Jeremiah's behalf, and was the means of saving him from death by famine ( Jeremiah 38:7-13 : comp  39:15-18 ).  </p>
Eben-ezer	<p>stone of help, the memorial stone set up by Samuel to commemorate the divine assistance to Israel in their great battle against the Philistines, whom they totally routed ( 1 Samuel 7:7-12 ) at Aphek, in the neighbourhood of Mizpeh, in Benjamin, near the western entrance of the pass of Beth-horon. On this very battle-field, twenty years before, the Philistines routed the Israelites, "and slew of the army in the field about four thousand men" ( 1 Samuel 4:1 1 Samuel 4:2 ; here, and at  5:1 , called "Eben-ezer" by anticipation). In this extremity the Israelites fetched the ark out of Shiloh and carried it into their camp. The Philistines a second time immediately attacked them, and smote them with a very great slaughter, "for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen. And the ark of God was taken" ( 1 Samuel 4:10 ). And now in the same place the Philistines are vanquished, and the memorial stone is erected by Samuel (q.v.). The spot where the stone was erected was somewhere "between Mizpeh and Shen." Some have identified it with the modern Beit Iksa, a conspicuous and prominent position, apparently answering all the necessary conditions; others with Dier Aban, 3 miles east of 'Ain Shems.  </p>
Eber	<p>beyond. </p><li>. The third post-duluvian patriach after Shem ( Genesis 10:24 ;  11:14 ). He is regarded as the founder of the Hebrew race ( 10:21 ;  Numbers 24:24 ). In  Luke 3:35  he is called Heber.  </li><li> One of the seven heads of the families of the Gadites ( 1 Chronicles 5:13 ).  </li><li> The oldest of the three sons of Elpaal the Benjamite ( 8:12 ).  </li><li> One of the heads of the familes of Benjamites in Jerusalem (22).  </li><li> The head of the priestly family of Amok in the time of Zerubbabel ( Nehemiah 12:20 ).   </li>
Ebony	<p>a black, hard wood, brought by the merchants from India to Tyre ( Ezekiel 27:15 ). It is the heart-wood, brought by Diospyros ebenus, which grows in Ceylon and Southern India.  </p>
Ebronah	<p>passage, one of the stations of the Israelites in their wanderings ( Numbers 33:34 Numbers 33:35 ). It was near Ezion-geber.  </p>
Ecbatana	<p>( Ezra 6:2  marg.). (See ACHMETHA .) </p>
Ecclesiastes	<p>the Greek rendering of the Hebrew <i> Koheleth</i> , which means "Preacher." The old and traditional view of the authorship of this book attributes it to Solomon. This view can be satisfactorily maintained, though others date it from the Captivity. The writer represents himself implicitly as ( Solomon 1:12 ). It has been appropriately styled The Confession of King Solomon. "The writer is a man who has sinned in giving way to selfishness and sensuality, who has paid the penalty of that sin in satiety and weariness of life, but who has through all this been under the discipline of a divine education, and has learned from it the lesson which God meant to teach him." "The writer concludes by pointing out that the secret of a true life is that a man should consecrate the vigour of his youth to God." The key-note of the book is sounded in ch  1:2 ,  </p><p> "Vanity of vanities! saith the Preacher,  Vanity of vanities! all is vanity!" </p><p> i.e., all man's efforts to find happiness apart from God are without result. </p>
Eclipse	<p>of the sun alluded to in  Amos 8:9 ;  Micah 3:6 ;  Zechariah 14:6 ;  Joel 2:10 . Eclipses were regarded as tokens of God's anger ( Joel 3:15 ;  Job 9:7 ). The darkness at the crucifixion has been ascribed to an eclipse ( Matthew 27:45 ); but on the other hand it is argued that the great intensity of darkness caused by an eclipse never lasts for more than six minutes, and this darkness lasted for three hours. Moreover, at the time of the Passover the moon was full, and therefore there could not be an eclipse of the sun, which is caused by an interposition of the moon between the sun and the earth.  </p>
Ed	<p>witness, a word not found in the original Hebrew, nor in the LXX. and Vulgate, but added by the translators in the Authorized Version, also in the Revised Version, of  Joshua 22:34 . The words are literally rendered: "And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad named the altar. It is a witness between us that Jehovah is God." This great altar stood probably on the east side of the Jordan, in the land of Gilead, "over against the land of Canaan." After the division of the Promised Land, the tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, on returning to their own settlements on the east of Jordan ( Joshua 22:1-6 ), erected a great altar, which they affirmed, in answer to the challenge of the other tribes, was not for sacrifice, but only as a witness ('Ed) or testimony to future generations that they still retained the same interest in the nation as the other tribes.  </p>
Edar	<p>tower of the flock, a tower between Bethlehem and Hebron, near which Jacob first halted after leaving Bethlehem ( Genesis 35:21 ). In  Micah 4:8  the word is rendered "tower of the flock" (marg., "Edar"), and is used as a designation of Bethlehem, which figuratively represents the royal line of David as sprung from Bethlehem.  </p>
Eden	<p>delight. </p><li> The garden in which our first parents dewlt ( Genesis 2:8-17 ). No geographical question has been so much discussed as that bearing on its site. It has been placed in Armenia, in the region west of the Caspian Sea, in Media, near Damascus, in Palestine, in Southern Arabia, and in Babylonia. The site must undoubtedly be sought for somewhere along the course of the great streams the Tigris and the Euphrates of Western Asia, in "the land of Shinar" or Babylonia. The region from about lat. 33 degrees 30' to lat. 31 degrees, which is a very rich and fertile tract, has been by the most competent authorities agreed on as the probable site of Eden. "It is a region where streams abound, where they divide and re-unite, where alone in the Mesopotamian tract can be found the phenomenon of a single river parting into four arms, each of which is or has been a river of consequence."  <p> Among almost all nations there are traditions of the primitive innocence of our race in the garden of Eden. This was the "golden age" to which the Greeks looked back. Men then lived a "life free from care, and without labour and sorrow. Old age was unknown; the body never lost its vigour; existence was a perpetual feast without a taint of evil. The earth brought forth spontaneously all things that were good in profuse abundance." </p></li><li> One of the markets whence the merchants of Tyre obtained richly embroidered stuffs ( Ezekiel 27:23 ); the same, probably, as that mentioned in  2 Kings 19:12 , and  Isaiah 37:12 , as the name of a region conquered by the Assyrians.  </li><li> Son of Joah, and one of the Levites who assisted in reforming the public worship of the sanctuary in the time of Hezekiah ( 2 Chronicles 29:12 ).   </li>
Eder	<p>flock. </p><li> A city in the south of Judah, on the border of Idumea ( Joshua 15:21 ).  </li><li> The second of the three sons of Mushi, of the family of Merari, appointed to the Levitical office ( 1 Chronicles 23:23 ;  24:30 ).   </li>
Edom	<p></p><li> The name of Esau (q.v.),  Genesis 25:30 , "Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage [Heb. haadom, haadom, i.e., 'the red pottage, the red pottage'] ...Therefore was his name called Edom", i.e., Red.  </li><li> Idumea ( Isaiah 34:5 Isaiah 34:6 ;  Ezekiel 35:15 ). "The field of Edom" ( Genesis 32:3 ), "the land of Edom" ( Genesis 36:16 ), was mountainous ( Obadiah 1:8 Obadiah 1:9 Obadiah 1:19 Obadiah 1:21 ). It was called the land, or "the mountain of Seir," the rough hills on the east side of the Arabah. It extended from the head of the Gulf of Akabah, the Elanitic gulf, to the foot of the Dead Sea ( 1 Kings 9:26 ), and contained, among other cities, the rock-hewn Sela (q.v.), generally known by the Greek name Petra ( 2 Kings 14:7 ). It is a wild and rugged region, traversed by fruitful valleys. Its old capital was Bozrah ( Isaiah 63:1 ). The early inhabitants of the land were Horites. They were destroyed by the Edomites ( Deuteronomy 2:12 ), between whom and the kings of Israel and Judah there was frequent war ( 2 Kings 8:20 ;  2 Chr  <span class="badLink">28:17</span> ).  <p> At the time of the Exodus they churlishly refused permission to the Israelites to pass through their land ( Numbers 20:14-21 ), and ever afterwards maintained an attitude of hostility toward them. They were conquered by David ( 2 Samuel 8:14 ; Compare  1 Kings 9:26 ), and afterwards by Amaziah ( 2 Chronicles 25:11 2 Chronicles 25:12 ). But they regained again their independence, and in later years, during the decline of the Jewish kingdom ( 2 Kings 16:6 ; RSV marg., "Edomites"), made war against Israel. They took part with the Chaldeans when Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem, and afterwards they invaded and held possession of the south of Palestine as far as Hebron. At length, however, Edom fell under the growing Chaldean power ( Jeremiah 27:3 Jeremiah 27:6 ).  </p><p> There are many prophecies concerning Edom ( Isaiah 34:5 Isaiah 34:6 ;  Jeremiah 49:7-18 ;  Ezekiel 25:13 ;  35:1-15 ;  Joel 3:19 ;  Amos 1:11 ; Obad.;  Malachi 1:3 Malachi 1:4 ) which have been remarkably fulfilled. The present desolate condition of that land is a standing testimony to the inspiration of these prophecies. After an existence as a people for above seventeen hundred years, they have utterly disappeared, and their language even is forgotten for ever. In Petra, "where kings kept their court, and where nobles assembled, there no man dwells; it is given by lot to birds, and beasts, and reptiles."  </p><p> The Edomites were Semites, closely related in blood and in language to the Israelites. They dispossessed the Horites of Mount Seir; though it is clear, from  Genesis 36 , that they afterwards intermarried with the conquered population. Edomite tribes settled also in the south of Judah, like the Kenizzites ( Genesis 36:11 ), to whom Caleb and Othniel belonged ( Joshua 15:17 ). The southern part of Edom was known as Teman.  </p> </li>
Edrei	<p>mighty; strength. </p><li> One of the chief towns of the kingdom of Bashan ( Joshua 12:4 Joshua 12:5 ). Here Og was defeated by the Israelites, and the strength of the Amorites broken ( Numbers 21:33-35 ). It subsequently belonged to Manasseh, for a short time apparently, and afterwards became the abode of banditti and outlaws ( Joshua 13:31 ). It has been identified with the modern Edr'a, which stands on a rocky promontory on the south-west edge of the Lejah (the Argob of the Hebrews, and Trachonitis of the Greeks). The ruins of Edr'a are the most extensive in the Hauran. They are 3 miles in circumference. A number of the ancient houses still remain; the walls, roofs, and doors being all of stone. The wild region of which Edrei was the capital is thus described in its modern aspect: "Elevated about 20 feet above the plain, it is a labyrinth of clefts and crevasses in the rock, formed by volcanic action; and owing to its impenetrable condition, it has become a refuge for outlaws and turbulent characters, who make it a sort of Cave of Adullam...It is, in fact, an impregnable natural fortress, about 20 miles in length and 15 in breadth" (Porter's Syria, etc.). Beneath this wonderful city there is also a subterranean city, hollowed out probably as a refuge for the population of the upper city in times of danger. (See BASHAN .) </li><li> A town of Naphtali ( Joshua 19:37 ).   </li>
Effectual call	<p>See CALL . </p>
Effectual prayer	<p>occurs in Authorized Version,  James 5:16 . The Revised Version renders appropriately: "The supplication of a righteous man availeth much in its working", i.e., "it moves the hand of Him who moves the world."  </p>
Egg	<p>(Heb. beytsah, "whiteness"). Eggs deserted ( Isaiah 10:14 ), of a bird ( Deuteronomy 22:6 ), an ostrich ( Job 39:14 ), the cockatrice ( Isaiah 59:5 ). In  Luke 11:12 , an egg is contrasted with a scorpion, which is said to be very like an egg in its appearance, so much so as to be with difficulty at times distinguished from it. In  Job 6:6  ("the white of an egg") the word for egg (hallamuth') occurs nowhere else. It has been translated "purslain" (RSV marg.), and the whole phrase "purslain-broth", i.e., broth made of that herb, proverbial for its insipidity; and hence an insipid discourse. Job applies this expression to the speech of Eliphaz as being insipid and dull. But the common rendering, "the white of an egg", may be satisfactorily maintained.  </p>
Eglah	<p>a heifer, one of David's wives, and mother of Ithream ( 2 Samuel 3:5 ;  1 Chronicles 3:3 ). According to a Jewish tradition she was Michal.  </p>
Eglaim	<p>two ponds, ( Isaiah 15:8 ), probably En-eglaim of  Ezekiel 47:10 .  </p>
Eglon	<p>the bullock; place of heifers. </p><li> Chieftain or king of one of the Moabite tribes ( Judges 3:12-14 ). Having entered into an alliance with Ammon and Amalek, he overran the trans-Jordanic region, and then crossing the Jordan, seized on Jericho, the "city of palm trees," which had been by this time rebuilt, but not as a fortress. He made this city his capital, and kept Israel in subjection for eighteen years. The people at length "cried unto the Lord" in their distress, and he "raised them up a deliverer" in Ehud (q.v.), the son of Gera, a Benjamite.  </li><li> A city in Judah, near Lachish ( Joshua 15:39 ). It was destroyed by ( Joshua 10:5 Joshua 10:6 ). It has been identified with Tell Nejileh, 6 miles south of Tell Hesy or Ajlan, north-west of Lachish. (See LACHISH .)  </li>
Egypt	<p>the land of the Nile and the pyramids, the oldest kingdom of which we have any record, holds a place of great significance in Scripture. </p><p> The Egyptians belonged to the white race, and their original home is still a matter of dispute. Many scholars believe that it was in Southern Arabia, and recent excavations have shown that the valley of the Nile was originally inhabited by a low-class population, perhaps belonging to the Nigritian stock, before the Egyptians of history entered it. The ancient Egyptian language, of which the latest form is Coptic, is distantly connected with the Semitic family of speech. </p><p> Egypt consists geographically of two halves, the northern being the Delta, and the southern Upper Egypt, between Cairo and the First Cataract. In the Old Testament, Northern or Lower Egypt is called Mazor, "the fortified land" ( Isaiah 19:6 ;  37: :  25 , where the A.V. mistranslates "defence" and "besieged places"); while Southern or Upper Egypt is Pathros, the Egyptian Pa-to-Res, or "the land of the south" ( Isaiah 11:11 ). But the whole country is generally mentioned under the dual name of Mizraim, "the two Mazors."  </p><p> The civilization of Egypt goes back to a very remote antiquity. The two kingdoms of the north and south were united by Menes, the founder of the first historical dynasty of kings. The first six dynasties constitute what is known as the Old Empire, which had its capital at Memphis, south of Cairo, called in the Old Testament Moph ( Hosea 9:6 ) and Noph. The native name was Mennofer, "the good place."  </p><p> The Pyramids were tombs of the monarchs of the Old Empire, those of Gizeh being erected in the time of the Fourth Dynasty. After the fall of the Old Empire came a period of decline and obscurity. This was followed by the Middle Empire, the most powerful dynasty of which was the Twelfth. The Fayyum was rescued for agriculture by the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty; and two obelisks were erected in front of the temple of the sun-god at On or Heliopolis (near Cairo), one of which is still standing. The capital of the Middle Empire was Thebes, in Upper Egypt. </p><p> The Middle Empire was overthrown by the invasion of the Hyksos, or shepherd princes from Asia, who ruled over Egypt, more especially in the north, for several centuries, and of whom there were three dynasties of kings. They had their capital at Zoan or Tanis (now San), in the north-eastern part of the Delta. It was in the time of the Hyksos that Abraham, Jacob, and Joseph entered Egypt. The Hyksos were finally expelled about B.C. 1600, by the hereditary princes of Thebes, who founded the Eighteenth Dynasty, and carried the war into Asia. Canaan and Syria were subdued, as well as Cyprus, and the boundaries of the Egyptian Empire were fixed at the Euphrates. The Soudan, which had been conquered by the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty, was again annexed to Egypt, and the eldest son of the Pharaoh took the title of "Prince of Cush."  </p><p> One of the later kings of the dynasty, Amenophis IV., or Khu-n-Aten, endeavoured to supplant the ancient state religion of Egypt by a new faith derived from Asia, which was a sort of pantheistic monotheism, the one supreme god being adored under the image of the solar disk. The attempt led to religious and civil war, and the Pharaoh retreated from Thebes to Central Egypt, where he built a new capital, on the site of the present Tell-el-Amarna. The cuneiform tablets that have been found there represent his foreign correspondence (about B.C. 1400). He surrounded himself with officials and courtiers of Asiatic, and more especially Canaanitish, extraction; but the native party succeeded eventually in overthrowing the government, the capital of Khu-n-Aten was destroyed, and the foreigners were driven out of the country, those that remained being reduced to serfdom.  </p><p> The national triumph was marked by the rise of the Nineteenth Dynasty, in the founder of which, Rameses I., we must see the "new king, who knew not Joseph." His grandson, Rameses II., reigned sixty-seven years (B.C. 1348-1281), and was an indefatigable builder. As Pithom, excavated by Dr. Naville in 1883, was one of the cities he built, he must have been the Pharaoh of the Oppression. The Pharaoh of the Exodus may have been one of his immediate successors, whose reigns were short. Under them Egypt lost its empire in Asia, and was itself attacked by barbarians from Libya and the north.  </p><p> The Nineteenth Dynasty soon afterwards came to an end; Egypt was distracted by civil war; and for a short time a Canaanite, Arisu, ruled over it. </p><p> Then came the Twentieth Dynasty, the second Pharaoh of which, Rameses III., restored the power of his country. In one of his campaigns he overran the southern part of Palestine, where the Israelites had not yet settled. They must at the time have been still in the wilderness. But it was during the reign of Rameses III. that Egypt finally lost Gaza and the adjoining cities, which were seized by the Pulista, or Philistines. </p><p> After Rameses III., Egypt fell into decay. Solomon married the daughter of one of the last kings of the Twenty-first Dynasty, which was overthrown by Shishak I., the general of the Libyan mercenaries, who founded the Twenty-second Dynasty ( 1 Kings 11:40 ;  1 Kings 14:25 1 Kings 14:26 ). A list of the places he captured in Palestine is engraved on the outside of the south wall of the temple of Karnak.  </p><p> In the time of Hezekiah, Egypt was conquered by Ethiopians from the Soudan, who constituted the Twenty-fifth Dynasty. The third of them was Tirhakah ( 2 Kings 19:9 ). In B.C. 674 it was conquered by the Assyrians, who divided it into twenty satrapies, and Tirhakah was driven back to his ancestral dominions. Fourteen years later it successfully revolted under Psammetichus I. of Sais, the founder of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty. Among his successors were Necho ( 2 Kings 23:29 ) and Hophra, or Apries ( Jeremiah 37:5 Jeremiah 37:7 Jeremiah 37:11 ). The dynasty came to an end in B.C. 525, when the country was subjugated by Cambyses. Soon afterwards it was organized into a Persian satrapy.  </p><p> The title of Pharaoh, given to the Egyptian kings, is the Egyptian Per-aa, or "Great House," which may be compared to that of "Sublime Porte." It is found in very early Egyptian texts. </p><p> The Egyptian religion was a strange mixture of pantheism and animal worship, the gods being adored in the form of animals. While the educated classes resolved their manifold deities into manifestations of one omnipresent and omnipotent divine power, the lower classes regarded the animals as incarnations of the gods. </p><p> Under the Old Empire, Ptah, the Creator, the god of Memphis, was at the head of the Pantheon; afterwards Amon, the god of Thebes, took his place. Amon, like most of the other gods, was identified with Ra, the sun-god of Heliopolis. </p><p> The Egyptians believed in a resurrection and future life, as well as in a state of rewards and punishments dependent on our conduct in this world. The judge of the dead was Osiris, who had been slain by Set, the representative of evil, and afterwards restored to life. His death was avenged by his son Horus, whom the Egyptians invoked as their "Redeemer." Osiris and Horus, along with Isis, formed a trinity, who were regarded as representing the sun-god under different forms. </p><p> Even in the time of Abraham, Egypt was a flourishing and settled monarchy. Its oldest capital, within the historic period, was Memphis, the ruins of which may still be seen near the Pyramids and the Sphinx. When the Old Empire of Menes came to an end, the seat of empire was shifted to Thebes, some 300 miles farther up the Nile. A short time after that, the Delta was conquered by the Hyksos, or shepherd kings, who fixed their capital at Zoan, the Greek Tanis, now San, on the Tanic arm of the Nile. All this occurred before the time of the new king "which knew not Joseph" ( Exodus 1:8 ). In later times Egypt was conquered by the Persians (B.C. 525), and by the Greeks under Alexander the Great (B.C. 332), after whom the Ptolemies ruled the country for three centuries. Subsequently it was for a time a province of the Roman Empire; and at last, in A.D. 1517, it fell into the hands of the Turks, of whose empire it still forms nominally a part. Abraham and Sarah went to Egypt in the time of the shepherd kings. The exile of Joseph and the migration of Jacob to "the land of Goshen" occurred about 200 years later. On the death of Solomon, Shishak, king of Egypt, invaded Palestine ( 1 Kings 14:25 ). He left a list of the cities he conquered.  </p><p> A number of remarkable clay tablets, discovered at Tell-el-Amarna in Upper Egypt, are the most important historical records ever found in connection with the Bible. They most fully confirm the historical statements of the Book of Joshua, and prove the antiquity of civilization in Syria and Palestine. As the clay in different parts of Palestine differs, it has been found possible by the clay alone to decide where the tablets come from when the name of the writer is lost. The inscriptions are cuneiform, and in the Aramaic language, resembling Assyrian. The writers are Phoenicians, Amorites, and Philistines, but in no instance Hittites, though Hittites are mentioned. The tablets consist of official dispatches and letters, dating from B.C. 1480, addressed to the two Pharaohs, Amenophis III. and IV., the last of this dynasty, from the kings and governors of Phoenicia and Palestine. There occur the names of three kings killed by Joshua, Adoni-zedec, king of Jerusalem, Japhia, king of Lachish ( Joshua 10:3 ), and Jabin, king of Hazor ( 11:1 ); also the Hebrews (Abiri) are said to have come from the desert.  </p><p> The principal prophecies of Scripture regarding Egypt are these,  Isaiah 19 ;  Jeremiah 43: :  <span class="badLink">813</span> -13;  44:30 ;  46 ; Ezek. 29-32; and it might be easily shown that they have all been remarkably fulfilled. For example, the singular disappearance of Noph (i.e., Memphis) is a fulfilment of  Jeremiah 46:19 ,  Ezekiel 30:13 .  </p>
Ehud	<p>union. </p><li> A descendant of Benjamin ( 1 Chronicles 7:10 ), his great-grandson.  </li><li> The son of Gera, of the tribe of Benjamin ( Judges 3:15 ). After the death of Othniel the people again fell into idolatry, and Eglon, the king of Moab, uniting his bands with those of the Ammonites and the Amalekites, crossed the Jordan and took the city of Jericho, and for eighteen years held that whole district in subjection, exacting from it an annual tribute. At length Ehud, by a stratagem, put Eglon to death with a two-edged dagger a cubit long, and routed the Moabites at the fords of the Jordan, putting 10,000 of them to death. Thenceforward the land, at least Benjamin, enjoyed rest "for fourscore years" (Judg.  3:12-30 ). (See QUARRIES [2].) But in the south-west the Philistines reduced the Israelites to great straits (Judg.  5:6 ). From this oppression Shamgar was raised up to be their deliverer.   </li>
Ekron	<p>firm-rooted, the most northerly of the five towns belonging to the lords of the Philistines, about 11 miles north of Gath. It was assigned to Judah ( Joshua 13:3 ), and afterwards to ( <span class="badLink">Daniel 19:43</span> ), but came again into the full possession of the Philistines ( 1 Samuel 5:10 ). It was the last place to which the Philistines carried the ark before they sent it back to Israel ( 1 Samuel 5:10 ;  6:1-8 ). There was here a noted sanctuary of Baal-zebub ( 2 Kings 1: :  <span class="badLink">23616</span> ,3,6,16). Now the small village Akir. It is mentioned on monuments in B.C. 702, when Sennacherib set free its king, imprisoned by Hezekiah in Jerusalem, according to the Assyrian record.  </p>
Elah	<p>terebinth or oak. </p><li> Valley of, where the Israelites were encamped when David killed Goliath ( 1 Samuel 17:2 1 Samuel 17:19 ). It was near Shochoh of Judah and Azekah ( 17:1 ). It is the modern Wady es-Sunt, i.e., "valley of the acacia." "The terebinths from which the valley of Elah takes its name still cling to their ancient soil. On the west side of the valley, near Shochoh, there is a very large and ancient tree of this kind known as the 'terebinth of Wady Sur,' 55 feet in height, its trunk 17 feet in circumference, and the breadth of its shade no less than 75 feet. It marks the upper end of the Elah valley, and forms a noted object, being one of the largest terebinths in Palestine." Geikie's, The Holy Land, etc.  </li><li> One of the Edomite chiefs or "dukes" of Mount Seir ( Genesis 36:41 ).  </li><li> The second of the three sons of Caleb, the son of Jephunneh ( 1 Chronicles 4:15 ).  </li><li> The son and successor of Baasha, king of Israel ( 1 Kings 16:8-10 ). He was killed while drunk by Zimri, one of the captains of his chariots, and was the last king of the line of Baasha. Thus was fullfilled the prophecy of Jehu (6,7,11-14).  </li><li> The father of Hoshea, the last king of Israel ( 2 Kings 15:30 ;  17:1 ).   </li>
Elam	<p>highland, the son of Shem ( Genesis 10:22 ), and the name of the country inhabited by his descendants ( Genesis 14:1 Genesis 14:9 ;  Isaiah 11:11 ;  21:2 , etc.) lying to the east of Babylonia, and extending to the shore of the Mediterranean, a distance in a direct line of about 1,000 miles. The name Elam is an Assyrian word meaning "high."  </p><p> "The inhabitants of Elam, or 'the Highlands,' to the east of Babylon, were called Elamites. They were divided into several branches, speaking different dialects of the same agglutinative language. The race to which they belonged was brachycephalic, or short-headed, like the pre-Semitic Sumerians of Babylonia. </p><p> "The earliest Elamite kingdom seems to have been that of Anzan, the exact site of which is uncertain; but in the time of Abraham, Shushan or Susa appears to have already become the capital of the country. Babylonia was frequently invaded by the Elamite kings, who at times asserted their supremacy over it (as in the case of Chedorlaomer, the Kudur-Lagamar, or 'servant of the goddess Lagamar,' of the cuneiform texts). </p><p> "The later Assyrian monarchs made several campaigns against Elam, and finally Assur-bani-pal (about B.C. 650) succeeded in conquering the country, which was ravaged with fire and sword. On the fall of the Assyrian Empire, Elam passed into the hands of the Persians" (A.H. Sayce).  </p><p> This country was called by the Greeks Cissia or Susiana. </p>
Elasah	<p>God made. </p><li> One of the descendants of Judah, of the family of Hezron ( 1 Chronicles 2:39 , "Eleasah").  </li><li> A descendant of king Saul ( 1 Chronicles 8:37 ;  9:43 ).  </li><li> The son of Shaphan, one of the two who were sent by Zedekiah to Nebuchadnezzar, and also took charge of Jeremiah's letter to the captives in Babylon ( Jeremiah 29:3 ).   </li>
Elath	<p>grove; trees, ( Deuteronomy 2:8 ), also in plural form Eloth ( 1 Kings 9:26 , etc.); called by the Greeks and Romans Elana; a city of Idumea, on the east, i.e., the Elanitic, gulf, or the Gulf of Akabah, of the Red Sea. It is first mentioned in  Deuteronomy 2:8 . It is also mentioned along with Ezion-geber in  1 Kings 9:26 . It was within the limits of Solomon's dominion, but afterwards revolted. It was, however, recovered and held for a time under king Uzziah ( 2 Kings 14:22 ). Now the ruin Aila.  </p>
El-Bethel	<p>God of Bethel, the name of the place where Jacob had the vision of the ladder, and where he erected an altar ( Genesis 31:13 ;  35:7 ).  </p>
Eldad	<p>whom God has loved, one of the seventy elders whom Moses appointed ( Numbers 11:26 Numbers 11:27 ) to administer justice among the people. He, with Medad, prophesied in the camp instead of going with the rest to the tabernacle, as Moses had commanded. This incident was announced to Moses by Joshua, who thought their conduct in this respect irregular. Moses replied, "Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the Lord's people were prophets" ( Numbers 11:24-30 ; Compare  Mark 9:38 ;  Luke 9:49 ).  </p>
Elder	<p>a name frequently used in the Old Testament as denoting a person clothed with authority, and entitled to respect and reverence ( Genesis 50:7 ). It also denoted a political office ( Numbers 22:7 ). The "elders of Israel" held a rank among the people indicative of authority. Moses opened his commission to them ( Exodus 3:16 ). They attended Moses on all important occasions. Seventy of them attended on him at the giving of the law ( Exodus 24:1 ). Seventy also were selected from the whole number to bear with Moses the burden of the people ( Numbers 11:16 Numbers 11:17 ). The "elder" is the keystone of the social and political fabric wherever the patriarchal system exists. At the present day this is the case among the Arabs, where the sheik (i.e., "the old man") is the highest authority in the tribe. The body of the "elders" of Israel were the representatives of the people from the very first, and were recognized as such by Moses. All down through the history of the Jews we find mention made of the elders as exercising authority among the people. They appear as governors ( Deuteronomy 31:28 ), as local magistrates ( 16:18 ), administering justice ( 19:12 ). They were men of extensive influence ( 1 Samuel 30:26-31 ). In New Testament times they also appear taking an active part in public affairs ( Matthew 16:21 ;  21:23 ;  26:59 ).  </p><p> The Jewish eldership was transferred from the old dispensation to the new. "The creation of the office of elder is nowhere recorded in the New Testament, as in the case of deacons and apostles, because the latter offices were created to meet new and special emergencies, while the former was transmitted from the earlies times. In other words, the office of elder was the only permanent essential office of the church under either dispensation." </p><p> The "elders" of the New Testament church were the "pastors" ( Ephesians 4:11 ), "bishops or overseers" ( Acts 20:28 ), "leaders" and "rulers" ( Hebrews 13:7 ;  1 Thessalonians 5:12 ) of the flock. Everywhere in the New Testament bishop and presbyter are titles given to one and the same officer of the Christian church. He who is called presbyter or elder on account of his age or gravity is also called bishop or overseer with reference to the duty that lay upon him ( Titus 1:5-7 ;  Acts 20:17-28 ; Phil  1:1 ).  </p>
Elealeh	<p>God has ascended, a place in the pastoral country east of Jordan, in the tribe of Reuben ( Numbers 32:3 Numbers 32:37 ). It is not again mentioned till the time of ( Isaiah 15:4 ;  16:9 ) and ( Jeremiah 48:34 ). It is now an extensive ruin called el-A'al, about one mile north-east of Heshbon.  </p>
Eleazar	<p>God has helped. </p><li> The third son of Aaron ( Exodus 6:23 ). His wife, a daughter of Putiel, bore him Phinehas ( Exodus 6:25 ). After the death of Nadab and Abihu ( Leviticus 10:12 ;  Numbers 3:4 ) he was appointed to the charge of the sanctuary ( Numbers 3:32 ). On Mount Hor he was clothed with the sacred vestments, which Moses took from off his brother Aaron and put upon him as successor to his father in the high priest's office, which he held for more than twenty years ( Numbers 20:25-29 ). He took part with Moses in numbering the people ( Numbers 26:3 Numbers 26:4 ), and assisted at the inauguration of Joshua. He assisted in the distribution of the land after the conquest ( Joshua 14:1 ). The high-priesthood remained in his family till the time of Eli, into whose family it passed, till it was restored to the family of Eleazar in the person of Zadok ( 1 Samuel 2:35 ; Compare  1 Kings 2:27 ). "And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son" ( Joshua 24:33 ). The word here rendered "hill" is Gibeah, the name of several towns in Palestine which were generally on or near a hill. The words may be more suitably rendered, "They buried him in Gibeah of Phinehas", i.e., in the city of Phinehas, which has been identified, in accordance with Jewish and Samaritan traditions, with Kefr Ghuweirah='Awertah, about 7 miles north of Shiloh, and a few miles south-east of Nablus. "His tomb is still shown there, overshadowed by venerable terebinths." Others, however, have identified it with the village of Gaba or Gebena of Eusebius, the modern Khurbet Jibia, 5 miles north of Guphna towards Nablus.  </li><li> An inhabitant of Kirjath-jearim who was "sanctified" to take charge of the ark, although not allowed to touch it, while it remained in the house of his father Abinadab ( 1 Samuel 7:1 1 Samuel 7:2 ; Compare  Numbers 3:31 ;  4:15 ).  </li><li> The son of Dodo the Ahohite, of the tribe of Benjamin, one of the three most eminent of David's thirty-seven heroes ( 1 Chronicles 11:12 ) who broke through the Philistine host and brought him water from the well of Bethlehem ( 2 Samuel 23:9 2 Samuel 23:16 ).  </li><li> A son of Phinehas associated with the priests in taking charge of the sacred vessels brought back to Jerusalem after the Exile ( Ezra 8:33 ).  </li><li> A Levite of the family of Merari ( 1 Chronicles 23:21 1 Chronicles 23:22 ).   </li>
Elect lady	<p>to whom the Second Epistle of John is addressed ( 2 John 1:1 ). Some think that the word rendered "lady" is a proper name, and thus that the expression should be "elect Kyria."  </p>
Election of Grace	<p>The Scripture speaks (1) of the election of individuals to office or to honour and privilege, e.g., Abraham, Jacob, Saul, David, Solomon, were all chosen by God for the positions they held; so also were the apostles. (2) There is also an election of nations to special privileges, e.g., the Hebrews ( Deuteronomy 7:6 ;  Romans 9:4 ). (3) But in addition there is an election of individuals to eternal life ( 2 Thessalonians 2:13 ;  Ephesians 1:4 ;  1 Peter 1:2 ;  John 13:18 ).  </p><p> The ground of this election to salvation is the good pleasure of God ( Ephesians 1:5 Ephesians 1:11 ;  Matthew 11:25 Matthew 11:26 ;  John 15:16 John 15:19 ). God claims the right so to do ( Romans 9:16 Romans 9:21 ).  </p><p> It is not conditioned on faith or repentance, but is of soverign grace ( Romans 11:4-6 ;  Ephesians 1:3-6 ). All that pertain to salvation, the means ( Ephesians 2:8 ;  2 th  2:13 ) as well as the end, are of God ( Acts 5:31 ;  2 Tim  2:25 ;  1 Corinthians 1:30 ;  Ephesians 2:5 Ephesians 2:10 ). Faith and repentance and all other graces are the exercises of a regenerated soul; and regeneration is God's work, a "new creature."  </p><p> Men are elected "to salvation," "to the adoption of sons," "to be holy and without blame before him in love" ( 2 Thessalonians 2:13 ;  Galatians 4:4 Galatians 4:5 ;  Ephesians 1:4 ). The ultimate end of election is the praise of God's grace ( Ephesians 1:6 Ephesians 1:12 ). (See PREDESTINATION .) </p>
El-elohe-Isreal	<p>mighty one; God of Israel, the name which Jacob gave to the alter which he erected on the piece of land where he pitched his tent before Shechem, and which he afterwards purchased from the sons of Hamor ( Genesis 33:20 ).  </p>
Elements	<p>In its primary sense, as denoting the first principles or constituents of things, it is used in  2 Peter 3:10 : "The elements shall be dissolved." In a secondary sense it denotes the first principles of any art or science. In this sense it is used in  Galatians 4:3 Galatians 4:9 ;  Colossians 2:8 Colossians 2:20 , where the expressions, "elements of the world," "week and beggarly elements," denote that state of religious knowledge existing among the Jews before the coming of Christ, the rudiments of religious teaching. They are "of the world," because they are made up of types which appeal to the senses. They are "weak," because insufficient; and "beggarly," or "poor," because they are dry and barren, not being accompanied by an outpouring of spiritual gifts and graces, as the gospel is.  </p>
Elephant	<p>not found in Scripture except indirectly in the original Greek word (elephantinos) translated "of ivory" in  Revelation 18:12 , and in the Hebrew word (shenhabim, meaning "elephant's tooth") rendered "ivory" in  1 Kings 10:22  and  2 Chronicles 9:21 .  </p>
Elhanan	<p>whom God has graciously bestowed. </p><li> A warrior of the time of David famed for his exploits. In the Authorized Version ( 2 Samuel 21:19 ) it is recorded that "Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath." The Revised Version here rightly omits the words "the brother of." They were introduced in the Authorized Version to bring this passage into agreement with  1 Chronicles 20:5 , where it is said that he "slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath." Goliath the Gittite was killed by David ( 1 Samuel 17 ). The exploit of Elhanan took place late in David's reign.  </li><li> The son of Dodo, and one of David's warriors ( 2 Samuel 23:24 ).   </li>
Eli	<p>ascent, the high priest when the ark was at Shiloh ( 1 Samuel 1:3 1 Samuel 1:9 ). He was the first of the line of Ithamar, Aaron's fourth son ( 1 Chronicles 24:3 ; Compare  2 Samuel 8:17 ), who held that office. The office remained in his family till the time of Abiathar ( 1 Kings 2:26 1 Kings 2:27 ), whom Solomon deposed, and appointed Zadok, of the family of Eleazar, in his stead (35). He acted also as a civil judge in Israel after the death of Samson ( 1 Samuel 4:18 ), and judged Israel for forty years.  </p><p> His sons Hophni and Phinehas grossly misconducted themselves, to the great disgust of the people ( 1 Samuel 2:27-36 ). They were licentious reprobates. He failed to reprove them so sternly as he ought to have done, and so brought upon his house the judgment of God ( 2:22-33 ;  3:18 ). The Israelites proclaimed war against the Philistines, whose army was encamped at Aphek. The battle, fought a short way beyond Mizpeh, ended in the total defeat of Israel. Four thousand of them fell in "battle array". They now sought safety in having the "ark of the covenant of the Lord" among them. They fetched it from Shiloh, and Hophni and Phinehas accompanied it. This was the first time since the settlement of Israel in Canaan that the ark had been removed from the sanctuary. The Philistines put themselves again in array against Israel, and in the battle which ensued "Israel was smitten, and there was a very great slaughter." The tidings of this great disaster were speedily conveyed to Shiloh, about 20 miles distant, by a messenger, a Benjamite from the army. There Eli sat outside the gate of the sanctuary by the wayside, anxiously waiting for tidings from the battle-field. The full extent of the national calamity was speedily made known to him: "Israel is fled before the Philistines, there has also been a great slaughter among the people, thy two sons Hophni and Phinehas are dead, and the ark of God is taken" ( 1 Samuel 4:12-18 ). When the old man, whose eyes were "stiffened" (i.e., fixed, as of a blind eye unaffected by the light) with age, heard this sad story of woe, he fell backward from off his seat and died, being ninety and eight years old. (See ITHAMAR .) </p><p> Eli, Heb. eli, "my God", ( Matthew 27:46 ), an exclamation used by Christ on the cross. ( Mark 15:34 ), as usual, gives the original Aramaic form of the word, Eloi.  </p>
Eliab	<p>to whom God is father. </p><li> A Reubenite, son of Pallu ( Numbers 16:1 Numbers 16:12 ;  Numbers 26:8 Numbers 26:9 ;  Deuteronomy 11:6 ).  </li><li> A son of Helon, and chief of the tribe of Zebulun at the time of the census in the wilderness ( Numbers 1:9 ;  2:7 ).  </li><li> The son of Jesse, and brother of David ( 1 Samuel 16:6 ).

Eliakim	<p>whom God will raise up. </p><li> The son of Melea ( Luke 3:30 ), and probably grandson of Nathan.  </li><li> The son of Abiud, of the posterity of Zerubbabel ( Matthew 1:13 ).  </li><li> The son of Hilkiah, who was sent to receive the message of the invading Assyrians and report it to Isaiah ( 2 Kings 18:18 ;  19:2 ;  Isaiah 36:3 ;  37:2 ). In his office as governor of the palace of Hezekiah he succeeded Shebna ( Isaiah 22:15-25 ). He was a good man ( Isaiah 22:20 ;  2 Kings  18:37 ), and had a splendid and honourable career.  </li><li> The original name of Jehoiakim, king of Judah ( 2 Kings 23:34 ). He was the son of Josiah.   </li>
Eliam	<p>God's people. </p><li> The father of Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah ( 2 Samuel 11:3 ). In  1 Chronicles 3:5  his name is Ammiel.  </li><li> This name also occurs as that of a Gilonite, the son of Ahithophel, and one of David's thirty warriors ( 2 Samuel 23:34 ). perhaps these two were the same person.   </li>
Elias	<p>the Greek form of Elijah ( Matthew 11:14 ;  16:14 , etc.), which the Revised Version has uniformly adopted in the New Testament. (See ELIJAH .) </p>
Eliashib	<p>whom God will restore. </p><li> A priest, head of one of the courses of the priests of the time of David ( 1 Chronicles 24:12 ).  </li><li> A high priest in the time of Ezra and Nehemiah ( Nehemiah 12:22 Nehemiah 12:23 ). He rebuilt the eastern city wall ( 3:1 ), his own mansion being in that quarter, on the ridge Ophel ( Nehemiah 3:20 Nehemiah 3:21 ). His indulgence of Tobiah the Ammonite provoked the indignation of ( Nehemiah 13:4 Nehemiah 13:7 ).   </li>

Eliezer	<p>God his help. </p><li> "Of Damascus," the "steward" (RSV, "possessor") of Abraham's house ( Genesis 15:2 Genesis 15:3 ). It was probably he who headed the embassy sent by Abraham to the old home of his family in Padan-aram to seek a wife for his son Isaac. The account of this embassy is given at length in  Genesis 24 .  </li><li> The son of Becher, and grandson of Benjamin ( 1 Chronicles 7:8 ).  </li><li> One of the two sons of Moses, born during his sojourn in Midian ( Exodus 18:4 ;  1 Chronicles 23:15 1 Chronicles 23:17 ). He remained with his mother and brother Gershom with Jethro when Moses returned to Egypt. ( Exodus 18:4 ). They were restored to Moses when Jethro heard of his departure out of Egypt.  </li><li> One of the priests who blew the trumpet before the ark when it was brought to Jerusalem ( 1 Chronicles 15:24 ).  </li><li> Son of Zichri, and chief of the Reubenites under David ( 1 Chronicles 27:16 ).  </li><li> A prophet in the time of Jehoshaphat ( 2 Chronicles 20:37 ). Others of this name are mentioned  Luke 3:29 ;  Ezra 8:16 ;  Ezra 10:18 Ezra 10:23 Ezra 10:31 .   </li>
Elihu	<p>whose God is he. </p><li> "The son of Barachel, a Buzite" ( Job 32:2 ), one of Job's friends. When the debate between Job and his friends is brought to a close, Elihu for the first time makes his appearance, and delivers his opinion on the points at issue ( Job 3237 -37).  </li><li> The son of Tohu, and grandfather of Elkanah ( 1 Samuel 1:1 ). He is called also Eliel ( 1 Chronicles 6:34 ) and Eliab ( 6:27 ).  </li><li> One of the captains of thousands of Manasseh who joined David at Ziklag ( 1 Chronicles 12:20 ).  </li><li> One of the family of Obed-edom, who were appointed porters of the temple under David ( 1 Chronicles 26:7 ).   </li>
Elijah	<p>whose God is Jehovah. </p><li> "The Tishbite," the "Elias" of the New Testament, is suddenly introduced to our notice in  1 Kings 17:1  as delivering a message from the Lord to Ahab. There is mention made of a town called Thisbe, south of Kadesh, but it is impossible to say whether this was the place referred to in the name given to the prophet.  <p> Having delivered his message to Ahab, he retired at the command of God to a hiding-place by the brook Cherith, beyond Jordan, where he was fed by ravens. When the brook dried up God sent him to the widow of Zarephath, a city of Zidon, from whose scanty store he was supported for the space of two years. During this period the widow's son died, and was restored to life by Elijah ( 1 Kings 17: :  <span class="badLink">224</span> -24).  </p><p> During all these two years a famine prevailed in the land. At the close of this period of retirement and of preparation for his work (Compare  Galatians 1:17 Galatians 1:18 ) Elijah met Obadiah, one of Ahab's officers, whom he had sent out to seek for pasturage for the cattle, and bade him go and tell his master that Elijah was there. The king came and met Elijah, and reproached him as the troubler of Israel. It was then proposed that sacrifices should be publicly offered, for the purpose of determining whether Baal or Jehovah were the true God. This was done on Carmel, with the result that the people fell on their faces, crying, "The Lord, he is the God." Thus was accomplished the great work of Elijah's ministry. The prophets of Baal were then put to death by the order of Elijah. Not one of them escaped. Then immediately followed rain, according to the word of Elijah, and in answer to his prayer ( James 5:18 ).  </p><p> Jezebel, enraged at the fate that had befallen her priests of Baal, threatened to put Elijah to death ( 1 Kings 19:1-13 ). He therefore fled in alarm to Beersheba, and thence went alone a day's journey into the wilderness, and sat down in despondency under a juniper tree. As he slept an angel touched him, and said unto him, "Arise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee." He arose and found a cake and a cruse of water. Having partaken of the provision thus miraculously supplied, he went forward on his solitary way for forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mount of God, where he took up his abode in a cave. Here the Lord appeared unto him and said, "What dost thou here, Elijah?" In answer to his despondent words God manifests to him his glory, and then directs him to return to Damascus and anoint Hazael king over Syria, and Jehu king over Israel, and Elisha to be prophet in his room ( 1 Kings 19:13-21 ; Compare  2 Kings 8:7-15 ;  9:1-10 ).  </p><p> Some six years after this he warned Ahab and Jezebel of the violent deaths they would die ( 1 Kings 21:19-24 ;  22:38 ). He also, four years afterwards, warned Ahaziah (q.v.), who had succeeded his father Ahab, of his approaching death ( 2 Kings 1:1-16 ). (See NABOTH .) During these intervals he probably withdrew to some quiet retirement, no one knew where. His interview with Ahaziah's messengers on the way to Ekron, and the account of the destruction of his captains with their fifties, suggest the idea that he may have been in retirement at this time on Mount Carmel. </p><p> The time now drew near when he was to be taken up into heaven ( 2 Kings 2:1-12 ). He had a presentiment of what was awaiting him. He went down to Gilgal, where was a school of the prophets, and where his successor Elisha, whom he had anointed some years before, resided. Elisha was solemnized by the thought of his master's leaving him, and refused to be parted from him. "They two went on," and came to Bethel and Jericho, and crossed the Jordan, the waters of which were "divided hither and thither" when smitten with Elijah's mantle. Arrived at the borders of Gilead, which Elijah had left many years before, it "came to pass as they still went on and talked" they were suddenly separated by a chariot and horses of fire; and "Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven, "Elisha receiving his mantle, which fell from him as he ascended.  </p><p> No one of the old prophets is so frequently referred to in the New Testament. The priests and Levites said to the Baptist ( John 1:25 ), "Why baptizest thou, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias?" Paul ( Romans 11:2 ) refers to an incident in his history to illustrate his argument that God had not cast away his people. ( James 5:17 ) finds in him an illustration of the power of prayer. (See also  Luke 4:25 ;  9:54 .) He was a type of John the Baptist in the sternness and power of his reproofs ( Luke 9:8 ). He was the Elijah that "must first come" ( Matthew 11:11 Matthew 11:14 ), the forerunner of our Lord announced by Malachi. Even outwardly the Baptist corresponded so closely to the earlier prophet that he might be styled a second Elijah. In him we see "the same connection with a wild and wilderness country; the same long retirement in the desert; the same sudden, startling entrance on his work ( 1 Kings 17:1 ;  Luke 3:2 ); even the same dress, a hairy garment, and a leathern girdle about the loins ( 2 Kings 1:8 ;  Matthew 3:4 )."  </p><p> How deep the impression was which Elijah made "on the mind of the nation may be judged from the fixed belief, which rested on the words of ( Malachi 4:5 Malachi 4:6 ), which many centuries after prevailed that he would again appear for the relief and restoration of the country. Each remarkable person as he arrives on the scene, be his habits and characteristics what they may, the stern John equally with his gentle Successor, is proclaimed to be Elijah ( Matthew 11:13 Matthew 11:14 ;  16:14 ;  17:10 ;  Mark 9:11 ;  15:35 ;  Luke 9:7 Luke 9:8 ;  John 1:21 ). His appearance in glory on the mount of transfiguration does not seem to have startled the disciples. They were 'sore afraid,' but not apparently surprised."  </p></li><li> The Elijah spoken of in  2 Chronicles 21:12-15  is by some supposed to be a different person from the foregoing. He lived in the time of Jehoram, to whom he sent a letter of warning (Compare  1 Chronicles 28:19 ;  Jeremiah 36 ), and acted as a prophet in Judah; while the Tishbite was a prophet of the northern kingdom. But there does not seem any necessity for concluding that the writer of this letter was some other Elijah than the Tishbite. It may be supposed either that Elijah anticipated the character of Jehoram, and so wrote the warning message, which was preserved in the schools of the prophets till Jehoram ascended the throne after the Tishbite's translation, or that the translation did not actually take place till after the accession of Jehoram to the throne ( 2 Chronicles 21:12 ;  2 Kings  8:16 ). The events of  2 Kings 2  may not be recorded in chronological order, and thus there may be room for the opinion that Elijah was still alive in the beginning of Jehoram's reign.   </li>
Elika	<p>God is his rejector, one of David's thirty-seven distinguished heros ( 2 Samuel 23:25 ).  </p>
Elim	<p>trees, ( Exodus 15:27 ;  Numbers 33:9 ), the name of the second station where the Israelites encamped after crossing the Red Sea. It had "twelve wells of water and threescore and ten palm trees." It has been identified with the Wady Ghurundel, the most noted of the four wadies which descend from the range of et-Tih towards the sea. Here they probably remained some considerable time. The form of expression in  Exodus 16:1  seems to imply that the people proceeded in detachments or companies from Elim, and only for the first time were assembled as a complete host when they reached the wilderness of Sin (q.v.).  </p>
Elimelech	<p>God his king, a man of the tribe of Judah, of the family of the Hezronites, and kinsman of Boaz, who dwelt in Bethlehem in the days of the judges. In consequence of a great dearth he, with his wife Naomi and his two sons, went to dwell in the land of Moab. There he and his sons died ( Ruth 1:2 Ruth 1:3 ;  Ruth 2:1 Ruth 2:3 ;  Ruth 4:3 Ruth 4:9 ). Naomi afterwards returned to Palestine with her daughter Ruth.  </p>
Elioenai	<p>toward Jehovah are my eyes, the name of several men mentioned in the Old Testament ( 1 Chronicles 7:8 ;  4:36 ;  Ezra 10:22 Ezra 10:27 ). Among these was the eldest son of Neariah, son of Shemaiah, of the descendants of Zerubbabel. His family are the latest mentioned in the Old Testament ( 1 Chronicles 3:23 1 Chronicles 3:24 ).  </p>
Eliphalet	<p>God his deliverance, one of David's sons ( 2 Samuel 5:16 ); called also Eliphelet ( 1 Chronicles 3:8 ).  </p>
Eliphaz	<p>God his strength. </p><li> One of Job's "three friends" who visited him in his affliction ( 4:1 ). He was a "Temanite", i.e., a native of Teman, in Idumea. He first enters into debate with Job. His language is uniformly more delicate and gentle than that of the other two, although he imputes to Job special sins as the cause of his present sufferings. He states with remarkable force of language the infinite purity and majesty of God ( 4:12-21 ;  15:12-16 ).  </li><li> The son of Esau by his wife Adah, and father of several Edomitish tribes ( Genesis 36:4 Genesis 36:10 Genesis 36:11 Genesis 36:16 ).   </li>
Elipheleh	<p>God will distinguish him, one of the porters appointed to play "on the Sheminith" on the occasion of the bringing up of the ark to the city of David ( 1 Chronicles 15:18 1 Chronicles 15:21 ).  </p>
Eliphelet	<p>God his deliverance. </p><li> One of David's distinguished warriors ( 2 Samuel 23:34 ); called also Eliphal in  1 Chronicles 11:35 .  </li><li> One of the sons of David born at Jerusalem ( 1 Chronicles 3:6 ;  14:5 ); called Elpalet in  1 Chronicles 14:5 . Also another of David's sons ( 1 Chronicles 3:8 ); called Eliphalet in  2 Samuel 5:16 ;  1 Chronicles 14:7 .  </li><li> A descendant of king Saul through Jonathan ( 1 Chronicles 8:39 ).   </li>
Elisabeth	<p>God her oath, the mother of John the Baptist ( Luke 1:5 ). She was a descendant of Aaron. She and her husband Zacharias (q.v.) "were both righteous before God" ( Luke 1:5 Luke 1:13 ). Mary's visit to Elisabeth is described in  1:39-63 .  </p>
Elisha	<p>God his salvation, the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah, who became the attendant and disciple of Elijah ( 1 Kings 19:16-19 ). His name first occurs in the command given to Elijah to anoint him as his successor ( 1 Kings 19:16 ). This was the only one of the three commands then given to Elijah which he accomplished. On his way from Sinai to Damascus he found Elisha at his native place engaged in the labours of the field, ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen. He went over to him, threw over his shoulders his rough mantle, and at once adopted him as a son, and invested him with the prophetical office (Compare  Luke 9:61 Luke 9:62 ). Elisha accepted the call thus given (about four years before the death of Ahab), and for some seven or eight years became the close attendant on Elijah till he was parted from him and taken up into heaven. During all these years we hear nothing of Elisha except in connection with the closing scenes of Elijah's life. After Elijah, Elisha was accepted as the leader of the sons of the prophets, and became noted in Israel. He possessed, according to his own request, "a double portion" of Elijah's spirit ( 2 Kings 2:9 ); and for the long period of about sixty years (B.C. 892-832) held the office of "prophet in Israel" ( 2 Kings 5:8 ).  </p><p> After Elijah's departure, Elisha returned to Jericho, and there healed the spring of water by casting salt into it ( 2 Kings 2:21 ). We next find him at Bethel ( 2:23 ), where, with the sternness of his master, he cursed the youths who came out and scoffed at him as a prophet of God: "Go up, thou bald head." The judgment at once took effect, and God terribly visited the dishonour done to his prophet as dishonour done to himself. We next read of his predicting a fall of rain when the army of Jehoram was faint from thirst ( 2 Kings 3:9-20 ); of the multiplying of the poor widow's cruse of oil ( 4:1-7 ); the miracle of restoring to life the son of the woman of Shunem ( 4:18-37 ); the multiplication of the twenty loaves of new barley into a sufficient supply for an hundred men ( 4:42-44 ); of the cure of Naaman the Syrian of his leprosy ( 5:1-27 ); of the punishment of Gehazi for his falsehood and his covetousness; of the recovery of the axe lost in the waters of the Jordan ( 6:1-7 ); of the miracle at Dothan, half-way on the road between Samaria and Jezreel; of the siege of Samaria by the king of Syria, and of the terrible sufferings of the people in connection with it, and Elisha's prophecy as to the relief that would come ( 2 Kings 6:24-7:2). ).  </p><p> We then find Elisha at Damascus, to carry out the command given to his master to anoint Hazael king over Syria ( 2 Kings 8:7-15 ); thereafter he directs one of the sons of the prophets to anoint Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Israel, instead of Ahab. Thus the three commands given to Elijah ( 9:1-10 ) were at length carried out.  </p><p> We do not again read of him till we find him on his death-bed in his own house ( 2 Kings 13:14-19 ). Joash, the grandson of Jehu, comes to mourn over his approaching departure, and utters the same words as those of Elisha when Elijah was taken away: "My father, my father! the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof."  </p><p> Afterwards when a dead body is laid in Elisha's grave a year after his burial, no sooner does it touch the hallowed remains than the man "revived, and stood up on his feet" ( 2 Kings 13:20-21 ).  </p>
Elishah	<p>the oldest of the four sons of Javan ( Genesis 10:4 ), whose descendants peopled Greece. It has been supposed that Elishah's descendants peopled the Peloponnesus, which was known by the name of Elis. This may be meant by "the isles of Elishah" (Ezek.  27:7 ).  </p>
Elishama	<p>whom God hears. </p><li> A prince of Benjamin, grandfather of Joshua ( Numbers 1:10 ;  1 Chronicles 7:26 ). </li><li> One of David's sons ( 2 Samuel 5:16 ). </li><li> Another of David's sons ( 1 Chronicles 3:6 ). </li><li> A priest sent by Jehoshaphat to teach the people the law ( 2 Chronicles 17:8 ).   </li>
Elishaphat	<p>whom God has judged, one of the "captains of hundreds" associated with Jehoiada in the league to overthrow the usurpation of Athaliah ( 2 Chronicles 23:1 ).  </p>
Elisheba	<p>God is her oath, the daughter of Amminadab and the wife of Aaron ( Exodus 6:23 ).  </p>
Elishua	<p>God his salvation, a son of David,  2 Samuel 5:15  = Elishama,  1 Chronicles 3:6 .  </p>
Elkanah	<p>God-created. </p><li> The second son of Korah ( Exodus 6:24 ), or, according to  1 Chronicles 6:22 1 Chronicles 6:23 , more correctly his grandson.  </li><li> Another Levite of the line of Heman the singer, although he does not seem to have performed any of the usual Levitical offices. He was father of Samuel the prophet ( 1 Chronicles 6:27 1 Chronicles 6:34 ). He was "an Ephrathite" ( 1 Samuel 1:1 1 Samuel 1:4 1 Samuel 1:8 ), but lived at Ramah, a man of wealth and high position. He had two wives, Hannah, who was the mother of Samuel, and Peninnah.   </li>
Elkosh	<p>God my bow, the birth-place of Nahum the prophet ( Nahum 1:1 ). It was probably situated in Galilee, but nothing definite is known of it.  </p>
Ellasar	<p>the oak or heap of Assyria, a territory in Asia of which Arioch was king ( Genesis 14:1 Genesis 14:9 ). It is supposed that the old Chaldean town of Larsa was the metropolis of this kingdom, situated nearly half-way between Ur (now Mugheir) and Erech, on the left bank of the Euphrates. This town is represented by the mounds of Senkereh, a little to the east of Erech.  </p>
Elm	<p> Hosea 4:13 ; rendered "terebinth" in the Revised Version. It is the Pistacia terebinthus of Linn., a tree common in Palestine, long-lived, and therefore often employed for landmarks and in designating places ( Genesis 35:4 ;  Judges 6:11 Judges 6:19 . Rendered "oak" in both A.V. and RSV). (See TEIL  TREE .) </p>
Elnathan	<p>whom God has given. </p><li> An inhabitant of Jerusalem, the father of Nehushta, who was the mother of king Jehoiachin ( 2 Kings 24:8 ). Probably the same who tried to prevent Jehoiakim from burning the roll of Jeremiah's prophecies ( Jeremiah 26:22 ;  36:12 ). </li><li> Ezra 8:16 .   </li>
Elon	<p>oak. </p><li> A city of Dan ( Joshua 19:43 ). </li><li> A Hittite, father of Bashemath, Esau's wife ( Genesis 26:34 ). </li><li> One of the sons of Zebulun ( Genesis 46:14 ). </li><li> The eleventh of the Hebrew judges. He held office for ten years ( Judges 12:11 Judges 12:12 ). He is called the Zebulonite.   </li>
Elparan	<p>oak of Paran, a place on the edge of the wilderness bordering the territory of the Horites ( Genesis 14:6 ). This was the farthest point to which Chedorlaomer's expedition extended. It is identified with the modern desert of et-Tih. (See PARAN .) </p>
Eltekeh	<p>God is its fear, a city in the tribe of Dan. It was a city of refuge and a Levitical city ( Joshua 21:23 ). It has been identified with Beit-Likia, north-east of latrum.  </p>
Elul	<p>( Nehemiah 6:15 ), the name of the sixth month of the ecclesiastical year, and the twelfth of the civil year. It began with the new moon of our August and September, and consisted of twenty-nine days.  </p>
Elymas	<p>magician or sorcerer, the Arabic name of the Jew Bar-jesus, who withstood Paul and Barnabas in Cyprus. He was miraculously struck with blindness ( Acts 13:11 ).  </p>
Embalming	<p>the process of preserving a body by means of aromatics ( Genesis 50:2 Genesis 50:3 Genesis 50:26 ). This art was practised by the Egyptians from the earliest times, and there brought to great perfection. This custom probably originated in the belief in the future reunion of the soul with the body. The process became more and more complicated, and to such perfection was it carried that bodies embalmed thousands of years ago are preserved to the present day in the numberless mummies that have been discovered in Egypt.  </p><p> The embalming of Jacob and Joseph was according to the Egyptian custom, which was partially followed by the Jews ( 2 Chronicles 16:14 ), as in the case of king Asa, and of our Lord ( John 19:39 John 19:40 ;  Luke 23:56 ;  24:1 ). (See PHARAOH .) </p>
Embroider	<p>The art of embroidery was known to the Jews ( Exodus 26:36 ;  35:35 ;  38:23 ;  Judges 5:30 ;  Psalms 45:14 ). The skill of the women in this art was seen in the preparation of the sacerdotal robes of the high priest ( Exodus 28 ). It seems that the art became hereditary in certain families ( 1 Chronicles 4:21 ). The Assyrians were also noted for their embroidered robes ( Ezekiel 27:24 ).  </p>
Emerald	<p>Heb. nophek ( Exodus 28:18 ;  39:11 ); i.e., the "glowing stone", probably the carbuncle, a precious stone in the breastplate of the high priest. It is mentioned ( Revelation 21:19 ) as one of the foundations of the New Jerusalem. The name given to this stone in the New Testament Greek is smaragdos, which means "live coal."  </p>
Emerod	<p>See HAEMORRHOIDS . </p>
Emims	<p>terrors, a warlike tribe of giants who were defeated by Chedorlaomer and his allies in the plain of Kiriathaim. In the time of Abraham they occupied the country east of Jordan, afterwards the land of the Moabites ( Genesis 14:5 ;  Deuteronomy 2:10 ). They were, like the Anakim, reckoned among the Rephaim, and were conquered by the Moabites, who gave them the name of Emims, i.e., "terrible men" ( Deuteronomy 2:11 ). The Ammonites called them Zamzummims ( 2:20 ).  </p>
Emmanuel	<p>God with us,  Matthew 1:23 ). (See IMMANUEL .) </p>
Emmaus	<p>hot baths, a village "three-score furlongs" from jerusalem, where our Lord had an interview with two of his disciples on the day of his resurrection ( Luke 24:13 ). This has been identified with the modern el-Kubeibeh, lying over 7 miles north-west of Jerusalem. This name, el-Kubeibeh, meaning "little dome," is derived from the remains of the Crusaders' church yet to be found there. Others have identified it with the modern Khurbet Khamasa i.e., "the ruins of Khamasa", about 8 miles south-west of Jerusalem, where there are ruins also of a Crusaders' church. Its site, however has been much disputed.  </p>
Fable	<p>applied in the New Testament to the traditions and speculations, "cunningly devised fables", of the Jews on religious questions ( 1 Timothy 1:4 ;  4:7 ;  2 Tim  4:4 ;  Titus 1:14 ;  2 Pet  1:16 ). In such passages the word means anything false and unreal. But the word is used as almost equivalent to parable. Thus we have (1) the fable of Jotham, in which the trees are spoken of as choosing a king ( Judges 9:8-15 ); and (2) that of the cedars of Lebanon and the thistle as Jehoash's answer to Amaziah ( 2 Kings 14:9 ).  </p>
Face	<p>means simply presence, as when it is recorded that Adam and Eve hid themselves from the "face [RSV, 'presence'] of the Lord God" ( Genesis 3:8 ; Compare  Exodus 33:14 Exodus 33:15 , where the same Hebrew word is rendered "presence"). The "light of God's countenance" is his favour ( Psalms 44:3 ;  Daniel 9:17 ). "Face" signifies also anger, justice, severity ( Genesis 16:6 Genesis 16:8 ;  Exodus 2:15 ;  Psalms 68:1 ;  Revelation 6:16 ). To "provoke God to his face" ( Isaiah 65:3 ) is to sin against him openly.  </p><p> The Jews prayed with their faces toward the temple and Jerusalem ( 1 Kings 8:38 1 Kings 8:44 1 Kings 8:48 ;  Daniel 6:10 ). To "see God's face" is to have access to him and to enjoy his favour ( Psalms 17:15 ;  27:8 ). This is the privilege of holy angels ( Matthew 18:10 ;  Luke 1:19 ). The "face of Jesus Christ" ( 2 Corinthians 4:6 ) is the office and person of Christ, the revealer of the glory of God ( John 1:14 John 1:18 ).  </p>
Fair Havens	<p>a harbour in the south of Crete, some 5 miles to the east of which was the town of Lasea ( Acts 27:8 ). Here the ship of Alexandria in which Paul and his companions sailed was detained a considerable time waiting for a favourable wind. Contrary to Paul's advice, the master of the ship determined to prosecute the voyage, as the harbour was deemed incommodious for wintering in (9-12). The result was that, after a stormy voyage, the vessel was finally wrecked on the coast of Malta ( 27:40-44 ).  </p>
Fairs	<p>(Heb. 'izabhonim), found seven times in Ezek. 27, and nowhere else. The Authorized Version renders the word thus in all these instances, except in verse 33, where "wares" is used. The Revised Version uniformly renders by "wares," which is the correct rendering of the Hebrew word. It never means "fairs" in the modern sense of the word.  </p>
Faith	<p>Faith is in general the persuasion of the mind that a certain statement is true (Phil  1:27 ;  2 th  2:13 ). Its primary idea is trust. A thing is true, and therefore worthy of trust. It admits of many degrees up to full assurance of faith, in accordance with the evidence on which it rests.  </p><p> Faith is the result of teaching ( Romans 10:14-17 ). Knowledge is an essential element in all faith, and is sometimes spoken of as an equivalent to faith ( John 10:38 ;  1 John 2:3 ). Yet the two are distinguished in this respect, that faith includes in it assent, which is an act of the will in addition to the act of the understanding. Assent to the truth is of the essence of faith, and the ultimate ground on which our assent to any revealed truth rests is the veracity of God.  </p><p> Historical faith is the apprehension of and assent to certain statements which are regarded as mere facts of history. </p><p> Temporary faith is that state of mind which is awakened in men (e.g., Felix) by the exhibition of the truth and by the influence of religious sympathy, or by what is sometimes styled the common operation of the Holy Spirit. </p><p> Saving faith is so called because it has eternal life inseparably connected with it. It cannot be better defined than in the words of the Assembly's Shorter Catechism: "Faith in Jesus Christ is a saving grace, whereby we receive and rest upon him alone for salvation, as he is offered to us in the gospel." </p><p> The object of saving faith is the whole revealed Word of God. Faith accepts and believes it as the very truth most sure. But the special act of faith which unites to Christ has as its object the person and the work of the Lord Jesus Christ ( John 7:38 ;  Acts 16:31 ). This is the specific act of faith by which a sinner is justified before God ( Romans 3:22 Romans 3:25 ;  Galatians 2:16 ;  Philippians 3:9 ;  John 3:16-36 ;  Acts 10:43 ;  16:31 ). In this act of faith the believer appropriates and rests on Christ alone as Mediator in all his offices.  </p><p> This assent to or belief in the truth received upon the divine testimony has always associated with it a deep sense of sin, a distinct view of Christ, a consenting will, and a loving heart, together with a reliance on, a trusting in, or resting in Christ. It is that state of mind in which a poor sinner, conscious of his sin, flees from his guilty self to Christ his Saviour, and rolls over the burden of all his sins on him. It consists chiefly, not in the assent given to the testimony of God in his Word, but in embracing with fiducial reliance and trust the one and only Saviour whom God reveals. This trust and reliance is of the essence of faith. By faith the believer directly and immediately appropriates Christ as his own. Faith in its direct act makes Christ ours. It is not a work which God graciously accepts instead of perfect obedience, but is only the hand by which we take hold of the person and work of our Redeemer as the only ground of our salvation. </p><p> Saving faith is a moral act, as it proceeds from a renewed will, and a renewed will is necessary to believing assent to the truth of God ( 1 Corinthians 2:14 ;  2 co  4:4 ). Faith, therefore, has its seat in the moral part of our nature fully as much as in the intellectual. The mind must first be enlightened by divine teaching ( John 6:44 ;  Acts 13:48 ;  2 co  4:6 ;  Ephesians 1:17 Ephesians 1:18 ) before it can discern the things of the Spirit.  </p><p> Faith is necessary to our salvation ( Mark 16:16 ), not because there is any merit in it, but simply because it is the sinner's taking the place assigned him by God, his falling in with what God is doing.  </p><p> The warrant or ground of faith is the divine testimony, not the reasonableness of what God says, but the simple fact that he says it. Faith rests immediately on, "Thus saith the Lord." But in order to this faith the veracity, sincerity, and truth of God must be owned and appreciated, together with his unchangeableness. God's word encourages and emboldens the sinner personally to transact with Christ as God's gift, to close with him, embrace him, give himself to Christ, and take Christ as his. That word comes with power, for it is the word of God who has revealed himself in his works, and especially in the cross. God is to be believed for his word's sake, but also for his name's sake. </p><p> Faith in Christ secures for the believer freedom from condemnation, or justification before God; a participation in the life that is in Christ, the divine life ( John 14:19 ;  Romans 6:4-10 ;  Ephesians 4:15 Ephesians 4:16 , etc.); "peace with God" ( Romans 5:1 ); and sanctification ( Acts 26:18 ;  Galatians 5:6 ;  Acts 15:9 ).  </p><p> All who thus believe in Christ will certainly be saved ( John 6:37 John 6:40 ;  John 10:27 John 10:28 ;  Romans 8:1 ).  </p><p> The faith=the gospel ( Acts 6:7 ;  Romans 1:5 ;  Galatians 1:23 ;  1 Timothy 3:9 ;  Jude 1:3 ).  </p>
Faithful	<p>as a designation of Christians, means full of faith, trustful, and not simply trustworthy ( Acts 10:45 ;  16:1 ;  2 co  6:15 ;  Colossians 1:2 ;  1 Timothy 4:3 1 Timothy 4:12 ;  5:16 ;  6:2 ;  Titus 1:6 ;  Ephesians 1:1 ;  1 Corinthians 4:17 , etc.).  </p><p> It is used also of God's word or covenant as true and to be trusted ( Psalms 119:86 Psalms 119:138 ;  Isaiah 25:1 ;  1 Timothy 1:15 ;  Revelation 21:5 ;  22:6 , etc.).  </p>
Fall of man	<p>an expression probably borrowed from the Apocryphal Book of Wisdom, to express the fact of the revolt of our first parents from God, and the consequent sin and misery in which they and all their posterity were involved. </p><p> The history of the Fall is recorded in  Genesis 2  and 3. That history is to be literally interpreted. It records facts which underlie the whole system of revealed truth. It is referred to by our Lord and his apostles not only as being true, but as furnishing the ground of all God's subsequent dispensations and dealings with the children of men. The record of Adam's temptation and fall must be taken as a true historical account, if we are to understand the Bible at all as a revelation of God's purpose of mercy.  </p><p> The effects of this first sin upon our first parents themselves were (1) "shame, a sense of degradation and pollution; (2) dread of the displeasure of God, or a sense of guilt, and the consequent desire to hide from his presence. These effects were unavoidable. They prove the loss not only of innocence but of original righteousness, and, with it, of the favour and fellowship of God. The state therefore to which Adam was reduced by his disobedience, so far as his subjective condition is concerned, was analogous to that of the fallen angels. He was entirely and absolutely ruined" (Hodge's Theology).  </p><p> But the unbelief and disobedience of our first parents brought not only on themselves this misery and ruin, it entailed also the same sad consequences on all their descendants. </p><li> The guilt, i.e., liability to punishment, of that sin comes by imputation upon all men, because all were represented by Adam in the covenant of works (q.v.). (See IMPUTATION .) </li><li> Hence, also, all his descendants inherit a corrupt nature. In all by nature there is an inherent and prevailing tendency to sin. This universal depravity is taught by universal experience. All men sin as soon as they are capable of moral actions. The testimony of the Scriptures to the same effect is most abundant (Rom. 1; 2;  3:1-19 , etc.).  </li><li> This innate depravity is total: we are by nature "dead in trespasses and sins," and must be "born again" before we can enter into the kingdom ( John 3:7 , etc.).  </li><li> Resulting from this "corruption of our whole nature" is our absolute moral inability to change our nature or to obey the law of God.  <p> Commenting on  John 9:3 , Ryle well remarks: "A deep and instructive principle lies in these words. They surely throw some light on that great question, the origin of evil. God has thought fit to allow evil to exist in order that he may have a platform for showing his mercy, grace, and compassion. If man had never fallen there would have been no opportunity of showing divine mercy. But by permitting evil, mysterious as it seems, God's works of grace, mercy, and wisdom in saving sinners have been wonderfully manifested to all his creatures. The redeeming of the church of elect sinners is the means of 'showing to principalities and powers the manifold wisdom of God' ( Ephesians 3:10 ). Without the Fall we should have known nothing of the Cross and the Gospel."  </p><p> On the monuments of Egypt are found representations of a deity in human form, piercing with a spear the head of a serpent. This is regarded as an illustration of the wide dissemination of the tradition of the Fall. The story of the "golden age," which gives place to the "iron age", the age of purity and innocence, which is followed by a time when man becomes a prey to sin and misery, as represented in the mythology of Greece and Rome, has also been regarded as a tradition of the Fall. </p> </li>
Fallow-deer	<p> Deuteronomy 14:5  (RSV, "Wild goat");  1 Kings 4:23  (RSV, "roebucks"). This animal, called in Hebrew <i> yahmur</i> , from a word meaning "to be red," is regarded by some as the common fallow-deer, the Cervus dama, which is said to be found very generally over Western and Southern Asia. It is called "fallow" from its pale-red or yellow colour. Some interpreters, however, regard the name as designating the bubale, Antelope bubale, the "wild cow" of North Africa, which is about the size of a stag, like the hartebeest of South Africa. A species of deer has been found at Mount Carmel which is called <i> yahmur</i> by the Arabs. It is said to be similar to the European roebuck. </p>
Fallow-ground	<p>The expression, "Break up your fallow ground" ( Hosea 10:12 ;  Jeremiah 4:3 ) means, "Do not sow your seed among thorns", i.e., break off all your evil habits; clear your hearts of weeds, in order that they may be prepared for the seed of righteousness. Land was allowed to lie fallow that it might become more fruitful; but when in this condition, it soon became overgrown with thorns and weeds. The cultivator of the soil was careful to "break up" his fallow ground, i.e., to clear the field of weeds, before sowing seed in it. So says the prophet, "Break off your evil ways, repent of your sins, cease to do evil, and then the good seed of the word will have room to grow and bear fruit."  </p>
Familiar spirit	<p>Sorcerers or necormancers, who professed to call up the dead to answer questions, were said to have a "familiar spirit" ( Deuteronomy 18:11 ;  2 Kings  21:6 ;  2 Chr  33:6 ;  Leviticus 19:31 ;  20:6 ;  Isaiah 8:19 ;  29:4 ). Such a person was called by the Hebrews an <i> 'ob</i> , which properly means a leathern bottle; for sorcerers were regarded as vessels containing the inspiring demon. This Hebrew word was equivalent to the pytho of the Greeks, and was used to denote both the person and the spirit which possessed him ( Leviticus 20:27 ;  1 Samuel 28:8 ; Compare  Acts 16:16 ). The word "familiar" is from the Latin familiaris, meaning a "household servant," and was intended to express the idea that sorcerers had spirits as their servants ready to obey their commands.  </p>
Famine	<p>The first mentioned in Scripture was so grievous as to compel Abraham to go down to the land of Egypt ( Genesis 26:1 ). Another is mentioned as having occurred in the days of Isaac, causing him to go to Gerar ( Genesis 26:1 Genesis 26:17 ). But the most remarkable of all was that which arose in Egypt in the days of Joseph, which lasted for seven years ( Genesis 4145 -45).  </p><p> Famines were sent as an effect of God's anger against a guilty people ( 2 Kings 8:1 2 Kings 8:2 ;  Amos 8:11 ;  Deuteronomy 28:22-42 ;  2 Sam  21:1 ;  2 Kings  6:25-28 ;  25:3 ;  Jeremiah 14:15 ;  19:9 ;  42:17 , etc.). A famine was predicted by Agabus ( Acts 11:28 ). Josephus makes mention of the famine which occurred A.D. 45. Helena, queen of Adiabene, being at Jerusalem at that time, procured corn from Alexandria and figs from Cyprus for its poor inhabitants.  </p>
Fan	<p>a winnowing shovel by which grain was thrown up against the wind that it might be cleansed from broken straw and chaff ( Isaiah 30:24 ;  Jeremiah 15:7 ;  Matthew 3:12 ). (See AGRICULTURE .) </p>
Farm	<p>( Matthew 22:5 ). Every Hebrew had a certain portion of land assigned to him as a possession ( Numbers 26:33-56 ). In Egypt the lands all belonged to the king, and the husbandmen were obliged to give him a fifth part of the produce; so in Palestine Jehovah was the sole possessor of the soil, and the people held it by direct tenure from him. By the enactment of Moses, the Hebrews paid a tithe of the produce to Jehovah, which was assigned to the priesthood. Military service when required was also to be rendered by every Hebrew at his own expense. The occuptaion of a husbandman was held in high honour ( 1 Samuel 11:5-7 ;  1 Kings 19:19 ;  2 Chr  26:10 ). (See LAND LAWS (n/a);  TITHE .) </p>
Farthing	<p></p><li> Matthew 10:29 ;  Luke 12:6 . Greek assarion, i.e., a small <i> as</i> , which was a Roman coin equal to a tenth of a denarius or drachma, nearly equal to a halfpenny of our money. </li><li> Matthew 5:26 ;  Mark 12:42  (Gr. kodrantes), the quadrant, the fourth of an <i> as</i> , equal to two lepta, mites. The lepton (mite) was the very smallest copper coin.  </li>
Fast	<p>The sole fast required by the law of Moses was that of the great Day of Atonement (q.v.),  Leviticus 23:26-32 . It is called "the fast" ( Acts 27:9 ).  </p><p> The only other mention of a periodical fast in the Old Testament is in  Zechariah 7:1-7 ;  8:19 , from which it appears that during their captivity the Jews observed four annual fasts.  </p><li> The fast of the fourth month, kept on the seventeenth day of Tammuz, the anniversary of the capture of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans; to commemorate also the incident recorded  Exodus 32:19 . (Compare  Jeremiah 52:6 Jeremiah 52:7 .)  </li><li> The fast of the fifth month, kept on the ninth of Ab (Compare  Numbers 14:27 ), to commemorate the burning of the city and temple ( Jeremiah 52:12 Jeremiah 52:13 ).  </li><li> The fast of the seventh month, kept on the third of Tisri (Compare  2 Kings 25 ), the anniversary of the murder of Gedaliah ( Jeremiah 41:1 Jeremiah 41:2 ).  </li><li> The fast of the tenth month (Compare  Jeremiah 52:4 ; Ezek.  33:21 ;  2 Kings  25:1 ), to commemorate the beginning of the siege of the holy city by Nebuchadnezzar.  <p> There was in addition to these the fast appointed by ( Esther 4:16 ).  </p><p> Public national fasts on account of sin or to supplicate divine favour were sometimes held. </p></li><li> 1 Samuel 7:6 ; </li><li> 2 Chronicles 20:3 ; </li><li> Jeremiah 36:6-10 ; </li><li> Nehemiah 9:1 .  <p> There were also local fasts. </p></li><li> Judges 20:26 ; </li><li> 2 Samuel 1:12 ; </li><li> 1 Samuel 31:13 ; </li><li> 1 Kings 21:9-12 ; </li><li> Ezra 8:21-23 : </li><li> Jonah 3:5-9 .  <p> There are many instances of private occasional fasting ( 1 Samuel 1:7 :  20:34 ;  2 Sam  <span class="badLink">3:35</span> ;  12:16 ;  1 Kings 21:27 ;  Ezra 10:6 ;  Nehemiah 1:4 ;  Daniel 10:2 Daniel 10:3 ). Moses fasted forty days ( Exodus 24:18 ;  34:28 ), and so also did Elijah ( 1 Kings 19:8 ). Our Lord fasted forty days in the wilderness ( Matthew 4:2 ).  </p><p> In the lapse of time the practice of fasting was lamentably abused ( Isaiah 58:4 ;  Jeremiah 14:12 ;  Zechariah 7:5 ). Our Lord rebuked the Pharisees for their hypocritical pretences in fasting ( Matthew 6:16 ). He himself appointed no fast. The early Christians, however, observed the ordinary fasts according to the law of their fathers ( Acts 13:3 ;  14:23 ;  2 co  6:5 ).  </p> </li>
Fat	<p>(Heb. heleb) denotes the richest part of the animal, or the fattest of the flock, in the account of Abel's sacrifice ( Genesis 4:4 ). It sometimes denotes the best of any production ( Genesis 45:18 ;  Numbers 18:12 ;  Psalms 81:16 ;  147:47 ). The fat of sacrifices was to be burned ( Leviticus 3:9-11 ;  4:8 ;  7:3 ;  8:25 ;  Numbers 18:17 . Compare  Exodus 29:13-22 ;  Leviticus 3:3-5 ).  </p><p> It is used figuratively for a dull, stupid state of mind ( Psalms 17:10 ).  </p><p> In  Joel 2:24  the word is equivalent to "vat," a vessel. The hebrew word here thus rendered is elsewhere rendered "wine-fat" and "press-fat" ( Haggai 2:16 ;  Isaiah 63:2 ).  </p>
Father	<p>a name applied (1) to any ancestor ( Deuteronomy 1:11 ;  1 Kings 15:11 ;  Matthew 3:9 ;  23:30 , etc.); and (2) as a title of respect to a chief, ruler, or elder, etc. ( Judges 17:10 ;  18:19 ;  1 Samuel 10:12 ;  2 Kings  2:12 ;  Matthew 23:9 , etc.). (3) The author or beginner of anything is also so called; e.g., Jabal and Jubal ( Genesis 4:20 Genesis 4:21 ; Compare  Job 38:28 ).  </p><p> Applied to God ( Exodus 4:22 ;  Deuteronomy 32:6 ;  2 Sam  7:14 ;  Psalms 89:27 Psalms 89:28 , etc.). </p><li> As denoting his covenant relation to the Jews ( Jeremiah 31:9 ;  Isaiah 63:16 ;  64:8 ;  John 8:41 , etc.).  </li><li> Believers are called God's "sons" ( John 1:12 ;  Romans 8:16 ;  Matthew 6:4 Matthew 6:8 Matthew 6:15 Matthew 6:18 ;  Matthew 10:20 Matthew 10:29 ). They also call him "Father" ( Romans 1:7 ;  1 Corinthians 1:3 ;  2 co  1:2 ;  Galatians 1:4 )   </li>
Fathom	<p>(Old A.S. faethm, "bosom," or the outstretched arms), a span of six feet ( Acts 27:28 ). Gr. orguia (from orego, "I stretch"), the distance between the extremities of both arms fully stretched out.  </p>
Fatling	<p></p><li> A fatted animal for slaughter ( 2 Samuel 6:13 ;  Isaiah 11:6 ;  Ezekiel 39:18 . Compare  Matthew 22:4 , where the word used in the original, sitistos, means literally "corn-fed;" i.e., installed, fat). </li><li> Psalms 66:15  (Heb. meah, meaning "marrowy," "fat," a species of sheep). </li><li> 1 Samuel 15:9  (Heb. mishneh, meaning "the second," and hence probably "cattle of a second quality," or lambs of the second birth, i.e., autmnal lambs, and therfore of less value).   </li>
Fear of the Lord the	<p>is in the Old Testament used as a designation of true piety ( Proverbs 1:7 ;  Job 28:28 ;  Psalms 19:9 ). It is a fear conjoined with love and hope, and is therefore not a slavish dread, but rather filial reverence. (Compare  Deuteronomy 32:6 ;  Hosea 11:1 ;  Isaiah 1:2 ;  63:16 ;  64:8 .) God is called "the Fear of Isaac" ( Genesis 31:42 Genesis 31:53 ), i.e., the God whom Isaac feared.  </p><p> A holy fear is enjoined also in the New Testament as a preventive of carelessness in religion, and as an incentive to penitence ( Matthew 10:28 ;  2 co  5:11 ;  7:1 ; Phil  2:12 ;  Ephesians 5:21 ;  Hebrews 12:28 Hebrews 12:29 ).  </p>
Feast	<p>as a mark of hospitality ( Genesis 19:3 ;  2 Sam  3:20 ;  2 Kings  6:23 ); on occasions of domestic joy ( Luke 15:23 ;  Genesis 21:8 ); on birthdays ( Genesis 40:20 ;  Job 1:4 ;  Matthew 14:6 ); and on the occasion of a marriage ( Judges 14:10 ;  Genesis 29:22 ).  </p><p> Feasting was a part of the observances connected with the offering up of sacrifices ( Deuteronomy 12:6 Deuteronomy 12:7 ;  1 Samuel 9:19 ;  1 Samuel 16:3 1 Samuel 16:5 ), and with the annual festivals ( Deuteronomy 16:11 ). "It was one of the designs of the greater solemnities, which required the attendance of the people at the sacred tent, that the oneness of the nation might be maintained and cemented together, by statedly congregating in one place, and with one soul taking part in the same religious services. But that oneness was primarily and chiefly a religious and not merely a political one; the people were not merely to meet as among themselves, but with Jehovah, and to present themselves before him as one body; the meeting was in its own nature a binding of themselves in fellowship with Jehovah; so that it was not politics and commerce that had here to do, but the soul of the Mosaic dispensation, the foundation of the religious and political existence of Israel, the covenant with Jehovah. To keep the people's consciousness alive to this, to revive, strengthen, and perpetuate it, nothing could be so well adapated as these annual feasts." (See FESTIVALS .) </p>
Felix	<p>happy, the Roman procurator of Judea before whom Paul "reasoned" ( Acts 24:25 ). He appears to have expected a bribe from Paul, and therefore had several interviews with him. The "worthy deeds" referred to in  24:2  was his clearing the country of banditti and impostors.  </p><p> At the end of a two years' term, Porcius Festus was appointed in the room of Felix (A.D. 60), who proceeded to Rome, and was there accused of cruelty and malversation of office by the Jews of Caesarea. The accusation was rendered nugatory by the influence of his brother Pallas with Nero. (See Josephus, Ant. xx. 8,9.)  </p><p> Drusilla, the daughter of Herod Agrippa, having been induced by Felix to desert her husband, the king of Emesa, became his adulterous companion. She was seated beside him when Paul "reasoned" before the judge. When Felix gave place to Festus, being "willing to do the Jews a pleasure," he left Paul bound. </p>
Fellowship	<p></p><li> With God, consisting in the knowledge of his will ( Job 22:21 ;  John 17:3 ); agreement with his designs ( Amos 3:2 ); mutual affection ( Romans 8: :  3839 ,39); enjoyment of his presence ( Psalms 4:6 ); conformity to his image ( 1 John 2:6 ;  1:6 ); and participation of his felicity ( 1 John 1:3 1 John 1:4 ;  Ephesians 3:14-21 ).  </li><li> Of saints with one another, in duties ( Romans 12:5 ;  1 Corinthians 12:1 ;  1 Thessalonians 5:17 1 Thessalonians 5:18 ); in ordinances ( Hebrews 10:25 ;  Acts 2:46 ); in grace, love, joy, etc. ( Malachi 3:16 ;  2 co  8:4 ); mutual interest, spiritual and temporal ( Romans 12:4 Romans 12:13 ;  Hebrews 13:16 ); in sufferings ( Romans 15:1 Romans 15:2 ;  Galatians 6:1 Galatians 6:2 ;  Romans 12:15 ; and in glory ( Revelation 7:9 ).   </li>
Fence	<p>(Heb. gader),  Numbers 22:24  (RSV). Fences were constructions of unmortared stones, to protect gardens, vineyards, sheepfolds, etc. From various causes they were apt to bulge out and fall ( Psalms 62:3 ). In  Psalms 80:12 , RSV (see  Isaiah 5:5 ), the psalmist says, "Why hast thou broken down her fences?" Serpents delight to lurk in the crevices of such fences (Eccl  10:8 ; Compare  Amos 5:19 ).  </p>
Fenced cities	<p>There were in Palestine (1) cities, (2) unwalled villages, and (3) villages with castles or towers ( 1 Chronicles 27:25 ). Cities, so called, had walls, and were thus fenced. The fortifications consisted of one or two walls, on which were towers or parapets at regular intervals ( 2 Chronicles 32:5 ;  Jeremiah 31:38 ). Around ancient Jerusalem were three walls, on one of which were ninety towers, on the second fourteen, and on the third sixty. The tower of Hananeel, near the north-east corner of the city wall, is frequently referred to ( Nehemiah 3:1 ;  12:39 ;  Zechariah 14:10 ). The gateways of such cities were also fortified ( Nehemiah 2:8 ;  Nehemiah 3:3 Nehemiah 3:6 ;  Judges 16:2 Judges 16:3 ;  1 Samuel 23:7 ).  </p><p> The Hebrews found many fenced cities when they entered the Promised Land ( Numbers 13:28 ;  Numbers 32:17 Numbers 32:34-42 ;  Joshua 11:12 Joshua 11:13 ; Judg.  <span class="badLink">1:27-33</span> ), and we may estimate the strength of some of these cities from the fact that they were long held in possession by the Canaanites. The Jebusites, e.g., were enabled to hold possession of Jerusalem till the time of David ( 2 Samuel 5:6 2 Samuel 5:7 ;  1 Chronicles 11:5 ).  </p><p> Several of the kings of Israel and Judah distinguished themselves as fortifiers or "builders" of cities. </p>
Ferret	<p> Leviticus 11:30  (RSV, "gecko"), one of the unclean creeping things. It was perhaps the Lacerta gecko which was intended by the Hebrew word (anakah, a cry, "mourning," the creature which groans) here used, i.e., the "fan-footed" lizard, the gecko which makes a mournful wail. The LXX. translate it by a word meaning "shrew-mouse," of which there are three species in Palestine. The Rabbinical writers regard it as the hedgehog.

Ferry boat	<p>( 2 Samuel 19:18 ), some kind of boat for crossing the river which the men of Judah placed at the service of the king. Floats or rafts for this purpose were in use from remote times ( Isaiah 18:2 ).  </p>
Festivals, Religious	<p>There were daily ( Leviticus 23 ), weekly, monthly, and yearly festivals, and great stress was laid on the regular observance of them in every particular ( Numbers 28:1-8 ;  Exodus 29:38-42 ;  Leviticus 6:8-23 ;  Exodus 30:7-9 ;  27:20 ).  </p><li> The septenary festivals were,  <p> (a) The weekly Sabbath ( Leviticus 23:1-3 ;  Exodus 19:3-30 ;  20:8-11 ;  31:12 , etc.).  </p><p> (b) The seventh new moon, or the feast of Trumpets ( Numbers 28:11-15 ;  29:1-6 ).  </p><p> (c) The Sabbatical year ( Exodus 23:10 Exodus 23:11 ;  Leviticus 25:2-7 ).  </p><p> (d) The year of jubilee ( <span class="badLink">Leviticus 2335</span> -35;  25: :  <span class="badLink">816</span> -16;  27:16-25 ).  </p></li><li> The great feasts were,  <p> (a) The Passover. (b) The feast of Pentecost, or of weeks. (c) The feast of Tabernacles, or of ingathering. </p><p> On each of these occasions every male Israelite was commanded "to appear before the Lord" ( Deuteronomy 27:7 ;  Nehemiah 8:9-12 ). The attendance of women was voluntary. (Compare  Luke 2:41 ;  1 Samuel 1:7 ;  2:19 .) The promise that God would protect their homes ( Exodus 34:23 Exodus 34:24 ) while all the males were absent in Jerusalem at these feasts was always fulfilled. "During the whole period between Moses and Christ we never read of an enemy invading the land at the time of the three festivals. The first instance on record is thirty-three years after they had withdrawn from themselves the divine protection by imbruing their hands in the Saviour's blood, when Cestius, the Roman general, slew fifty of the people of Lydda while all the rest had gone up to the feast of Tabernacles, A.D. 66."  </p><p> These festivals, besides their religious purpose, had an important bearing on the maintenance among the people of the feeling of a national unity. The times fixed for their observance were arranged so as to interfere as little as possible with the industry of the people. The Passover was kept just before the harvest commenced, Pentecost at the conclusion of the corn harvest and before the vintage, the feast of Tabernacles after all the fruits of the ground had been gathered in. </p></li><li> The Day of Atonement, the tenth day of the seventh month ( Leviticus 16:1 Leviticus 16:34 ;  23:26-32 ;  Numbers 29:7-11 ). (See ATONEMENT, DAY  OF .) <p> Of the post-Exilian festivals reference is made to the feast of Dedication ( John 10:22 ). This feast was appointed by Judas Maccabaeus in commemoration of the purification of the temple after it had been polluted by Antiochus Epiphanes. The "feast of Purim" (q.v.),  Esther 9:24-32 , was also instituted after the Exile. (Cf.  John 5:1 .)  </p> </li>
Festus, Porcius	<p>the successor of Felix (A.D. 60) as procurator of Judea ( Acts 24:27 ). A few weeks after he had entered on his office the case of Paul, then a prisoner at Caesarea, was reported to him. The "next day," after he had gone down to Caesarea, he heard Paul defend himself in the presence of Herod Agrippa II. and his sister Bernice, and not finding in him anything worthy of death or of bonds, would have set him free had he not appealed unto Caesar ( Acts 25:11 Acts 25:12 ). In consequence of this appeal Paul was sent to Rome. Festus, after being in office less than two years, died in Judea. (See AGRIPPA .) </p>
Fever	<p>( Deuteronomy 28:22 ;  Matthew 8:14 ;  Mark 1:30 ;  John 4:52 ;  Acts 28:8 ), a burning heat, as the word so rendered denotes, which attends all febrile attacks. In all Eastern countries such diseases are very common. Peter's wife's mother is said to have suffered from a "great fever" ( Luke 4:38 ), an instance of Luke's professional exactitude in describing disease. He adopts here the technical medical distinction, as in those times fevers were divided into the "great" and the "less."  </p>
Field	<p>(Heb. sadeh), a cultivated field, but unenclosed. It is applied to any cultivated ground or pasture ( Genesis 29:2 ;  31:4 ;  34:7 ), or tillage ( Genesis 37:7 ;  47:24 ). It is also applied to woodland ( Psalms 132:6 ) or mountain top ( Judges 9:32 Judges 9:36 ;  2 Sam  1:21 ). It denotes sometimes a cultivated region as opposed to the wilderness ( Genesis 33:19 ;  36:35 ). Unwalled villages or scattered houses are spoken of as "in the fields" ( Deuteronomy 28:3 Deuteronomy 28:16 ;  Leviticus 25:31 ;  Mark 6:36 Mark 6:56 ). The "open field" is a place remote from a house ( Genesis 4:8 ;  Leviticus 14:7 Leviticus 14:53 ;  17:5 ). Cultivated land of any extent was called a field ( Genesis 23:13 Genesis 23:17 ;  41:8 ;  Leviticus 27:16 ;  Ruth 4:5 ;  Nehemiah 12:29 ).  </p>
Fig	<p>First mentioned in  Genesis 3:7 . The fig-tree is mentioned ( Deuteronomy 8:8 ) as one of the valuable products of Palestine. It was a sign of peace and prosperity ( 1 Kings 4:25 ;  Micah 4:4 ;  Zechariah 3:10 ). Figs were used medicinally ( 2 Kings 20:7 ), and pressed together and formed into "cakes" as articles of diet ( 1 Samuel 30:12 ;  Jeremiah 24:2 ).  </p><p> Our Lord's cursing the fig-tree near Bethany ( Mark 11:13 ) has occasioned much perplexity from the circumstance, as mentioned by the evangelist, that "the time of figs was not yet." The explanation of the words, however, lies in the simple fact that the fruit of the fig-tree appears before the leaves, and hence that if the tree produced leaves it ought also to have had fruit. It ought to have had fruit if it had been true to its "pretensions," in showing its leaves at this particular season. "This tree, so to speak, vaunted itself to be in advance of all the other trees, challenged the passer-by that he should come and refresh himself with its fruit. Yet when the Lord accepted its challenge and drew near, it proved to be but as the others, without fruit as they; for indeed, as the evangelist observes, the time of figs had not yet arrived. Its fault, if one may use the word, lay in its pretensions, in its making a show to run before the rest when it did not so indeed" (Trench, Miracles).  </p><p> The fig-tree of Palestine (Ficus carica) produces two and sometimes three crops of figs in a year, (1) the bikkurah, or "early-ripe fig" ( Micah 7:1 ;  Isaiah 28:4 ;  Hosea 9:10 , RSV), which is ripe about the end of June, dropping off as soon as it is ripe ( Nahum 3:12 ); (2) the kermus, or "summer fig," then begins to be formed, and is ripe about August; and (3) the pag (plural "green figs," Cant  2:13 ; Gr. olynthos,  Revelation 6:13 , "the untimely fig"), or "winter fig," which ripens in sheltered spots in spring.  </p>
Fillets	<p>Heb. hashukum, plur., joinings ( Exodus 27:17 ;  Exodus 38:17 Exodus 38:28 ), the rods by which the tops of the columns around the tabernacle court were joined together, and from which the curtains were suspended ( Exodus 27:10 Exodus 27:11 ;  36:38 ).  </p><p> In  Jeremiah 52:21  the rendering of a different word, <i> hut</i> , meaning a "thread," and designating a measuring-line of 12 cubits in length for the circumference of the copper pillars of Solomon's temple.  </p>
Finer	<p>a worker in silver and gold ( Proverbs 25:4 ). In  Judges 17:4  the word (tsoreph) is rendered "founder," and in  Isaiah 41:7  "goldsmith."  </p>
Fining pot	<p>a crucible, melting-pot ( Proverbs 17:3 ;  27:21 ).  </p>
Fir	<p>the uniform rendering in the Authorized Version (marg. RSV, "cypress") of <i> berosh</i> ( 2 Samuel 6:5 ;  1 Kings 5:8 1 Kings 5:10 ;  1 Kings 6:15 1 Kings 6:34 ;  9:11 , etc.), a lofty tree ( Isaiah 55:13 ) growing on Lebanon ( 37:24 ). Its wood was used in making musical instruments and doors of houses, and for ceilings ( 2 Chronicles 3:5 ), the decks of ships ( Ezekiel 27:5 ), floorings and spear-shafts ( Nahum 2:3 , RSV). The true fir (abies) is not found in Palestine, but the pine tree, of which there are four species, is common.  </p><p> The precise kind of tree meant by the "green fir tree" ( Hosea 14:8 ) is uncertain. Some regard it as the sherbin tree, a cypress resembling the cedar; others, the Aleppo or maritime pine (Pinus halepensis), which resembles the Scotch fir; while others think that the "stone-pine" (Pinus pinea) is probably meant. (See PINE .) </p>
Fire	<p></p><li> For sacred purposes. The sacrifices were consumed by fire ( Genesis 8:20 ). The ever-burning fire on the altar was first kindled from heaven ( Leviticus 6:9 Leviticus 6:13 ;  9:24 ), and afterwards rekindled at the dedication of Solomon's temple ( 2 Chronicles 7:1 2 Chronicles 7:3 ). The expressions "fire from heaven" and "fire of the Lord" generally denote lightning, but sometimes also the fire of the altar was so called ( Exodus 29:18 ;  Leviticus 1:9 ;  2:3 ;  Leviticus 3:5 Leviticus 3:9 ).  <p> Fire for a sacred purpose obtained otherwise than from the altar was called "strange fire" ( Leviticus 10:1 Leviticus 10:2 ;  Numbers 3:4 ).  </p><p> The victims slain for sin offerings were afterwards consumed by fire outside the camp ( Leviticus 4:12 Leviticus 4:21 ;  6:30 ;  16:27 ;  Hebrews 13:11 ).  </p></li><li> For domestic purposes, such as baking, cooking, warmth, etc. ( Jeremiah 36:22 ;  Mark 14:54 ;  John 18:18 ). But on Sabbath no fire for any domestic purpose was to be kindled ( Exodus 35:3 ;  Numbers 15:32-36 ).  </li><li> Punishment of death by fire was inflicted on such as were guilty of certain forms of unchastity and incest ( Leviticus 20:14 ;  21:9 ). The burning of captives in war was not unknown among the Jews ( 2 Samuel 12:31 ;  Jeremiah 29:22 ). The bodies of infamous persons who were executed were also sometimes burned ( Joshua 7:25 ;  2 Kings  23:16 ).  </li><li> In war, fire was used in the destruction of cities, as Jericho ( Joshua 6:24 ), Ai ( 8:19 ), Hazor ( 11:11 ), Laish (Judg.  18:27 ), etc. The war-chariots of the Canaanites were burnt ( Joshua 11:6 Joshua 11:9 Joshua 11:13 ). The Israelites burned the images ( 2 Kings 10:26 ; RSV, "pillars") of the house of Baal. These objects of worship seem to have been of the nature of obelisks, and were sometimes evidently made of wood.  <p> Torches were sometimes carried by the soldiers in battle ( Judges 7:16 ).  </p></li><li> Figuratively, fire is a symbol of Jehovah's presence and the instrument of his power ( Exodus 14:19 ;  Numbers 11:1 Numbers 11:3 ; Judg.  13:20 ;  1 Kings 18:38 ;  2 Kings  1 Kings 1:10 1 Kings 1:12 ;  2:11 ;  Isaiah 6:4 ; Ezek.  1:4 ;  Revelation 1:14 , etc.).  <p> God's word is also likened unto fire ( Jeremiah 23:29 ). It is referred to as an emblem of severe trials or misfortunes ( Zechariah 12:6 ;  Luke 12:49 ;  1 Corinthians 3:13 1 Corinthians 3:15 ;  1 Peter 1:7 ), and of eternal punishment ( Matthew 5:22 ;  Mark 9:44 ;  Revelation 14:10 ;  21:8 ).  </p><p> The influence of the Holy Ghost is likened unto fire ( Matthew 3:11 ). His descent was denoted by the appearance of tongues as of fire ( Acts 2:3 ).  </p> </li>
Firebrand	<p> Isaiah 7:4 ,  Amos 4:11 ,  Zechariah 3:2 , denotes the burnt end of a stick (Heb. 'ud); in  Judges 15:4 , a lamp or torch, a flambeau (Heb. lappid); in  Proverbs 26:18  (Compare  Ephesians 6:16 ), burning darts or arrows (Heb. zikkim).  </p>
Firepan	<p>( Exodus 27:3 ;  38:3 ), one of the vessels of the temple service (rendered "snuff-dish"  Exodus 25:38 ;  37:23 ; and "censer"  Leviticus 10:1 ;  16:12 ). It was probably a metallic cinder-basin used for the purpose of carrying live coal for burning incense, and of carrying away the snuff in trimming the lamps.  </p>
Firkin	<p>Used only in  John 2:6 ; the Attic amphora, equivalent to the Hebrew bath (q.v.), a measure for liquids containing about 8 7/8 gallons.  </p>
Firmament	<p>from the Vulgate firmamentum, which is used as the translation of the Hebrew <i> raki'a</i> . This word means simply "expansion." It denotes the space or expanse like an arch appearing immediately above us. They who rendered <i> raki'a</i> by firmamentum regarded it as a solid body. The language of Scripture is not scientific but popular, and hence we read of the sun rising and setting, and also here the use of this particular word. It is plain that it was used to denote solidity as well as expansion. It formed a division between the waters above and the waters below ( Genesis 1:7 ). The <i> raki'a</i> supported the upper reservoir ( Psalms 148:4 ). It was the support also of the heavenly bodies ( Genesis 1:14 ), and is spoken of as having "windows" and "doors" ( Genesis 7:11 ;  Isaiah 24:18 ;  Malachi 3:10 ) through which the rain and snow might descend.  </p>
First-born	<p>sons enjoyed certain special privileges ( Deuteronomy 21:17 ;  Genesis 25:23 Genesis 25:31 Genesis 25:34 ;  49:3 ;  1 Chronicles 5:1 ;  Hebrews 12:16 ;  Psalms 89:27 ). (See BIRTHRIGHT .) </p><p> The "first-born of the poor" signifies the most miserable of the poor ( Isaiah 14:30 ). The "church of the first-born" signifies the church of the redeemed.  </p><p> The destruction of the first-born was the last of the ten plagues inflicted on the Egyptians ( Exodus 11:1-8 ;  Exodus 12:29 Exodus 12:30 ).  </p><p> Menephtah is probably the Pharaoh whose first-born was slain. His son did not succeed or survive his father, but died early. The son's tomb has been found at Thebes unfinished, showing it was needed earlier than was expected. Some of the records on the tomb are as follows: "The son whom Menephtah loves; who draws towards him his father's heart, the singer, the prince of archers, who governed Egypt on behalf of his father. Dead." </p>
First-born, Redemption of	<p>From the beginning the office of the priesthood in each family belonged to the eldest son. But when the extensive plan of sacrificial worship was introduced, requiring a company of men to be exclusively devoted to this ministry, the primitive office of the first-born was superseded by that of the Levites ( Numbers 3:11-13 ), and it was ordained that the first-born of man and of unclean animals should henceforth be redeemed ( 18:15 ).  </p><p> The laws concerning this redemption of the first-born of man are recorded in  Exodus 13:12-15 ;  22:29 ;  34:20 ;  Numbers 3:45 ;  8:17 ;  18:16 ;  Leviticus 12:2 Leviticus 12:4 .  </p><p> The first-born male of every clean animal was to be given up to the priest for sacrifice ( Deuteronomy 12:6 ;  Exodus 13:12 ;  34:20 ;  Numbers 18:15-17 ).  </p><p> But the first-born of unclean animals was either to be redeemed or sold and the price given to the priest ( Leviticus 27:11-13 Leviticus 27:27 ). The first-born of an ass, if not redeemed, was to be put to death ( Exodus 13:13 ;  34:20 ).  </p>
First-born, Sanctification of the	<p>A peculiar sanctity was attached to the first-born both of man and of cattle. God claimed that the first-born males of man and of animals should be consecrated to him, the one as a priest ( Exodus 19:22 Exodus 19:24 ), representing the family to which he belonged, and the other to be offered up in sacrifice ( Genesis 4:4 ).  </p>
First-fruits	<p>The first-fruits of the ground were offered unto God just as the first-born of man and animals. </p><p> The law required, </p><li> That on the morrow after the Passover Sabbath a sheaf of new corn should be waved by the priest before the altar ( Leviticus 23:5 Leviticus 23:6 Leviticus 23:10 Leviticus 23:12 ;  2:12 ).  </li><li> That at the feast of Pentecost two loaves of leavened bread, made from the new flour, were to be waved in like manner ( Leviticus 23:15 Leviticus 23:17 ;  Numbers 28:26 ).  </li><li> The feast of Tabernacles was an acknowledgement that the fruits of the harvest were from the Lord ( Exodus 23:16 ;  34:22 ).  </li><li> Every individual, besides, was required to consecrate to God a portion of the first-fruits of the land ( Exodus 22:29 ;  23:19 ;  34:26 ;  Numbers 15:20 Numbers 15:21 ).  </li><li> The law enjoined that no fruit was to be gathered from newly-planted fruit-trees for the first three years, and that the first-fruits of the fourth year were to be consecrated to the Lord ( Leviticus 19:23-25 ). ( Jeremiah 2:3 ) alludes to the ordinance of "first-fruits," and hence he must have been acquainted with the books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, where the laws regarding it are recorded.   </li>
Fish	<p>called <i> dag</i> by the Hebrews, a word denoting great fecundity ( Genesis 9:2 ;  Numbers 11:22 ;  Jonah 2:1 Jonah 2:10 ). No fish is mentioned by name either in the Old or in the New Testament. Fish abounded in the Mediterranean and in the lakes of the Jordan, so that the Hebrews were no doubt acquainted with many species. Two of the villages on the shores of the Sea of Galilee derived their names from their fisheries, Bethsaida (the "house of fish") on the east and on the west. There is probably no other sheet of water in the world of equal dimensions that contains such a variety and profusion of fish. About thirty-seven different kinds have been found. Some of the fishes are of a European type, such as the roach, the barbel, and the blenny; others are markedly African and tropical, such as the eel-like silurus. There was a regular fish-market apparently in Jerusalem ( 2 Chronicles 33:14 ;  Nehemiah 3:3 ;  12:39 ;  Zephaniah 1:10 ), as there was a fish-gate which was probably contiguous to it.  </p><p> Sidon is the oldest fishing establishment known in history. </p>
Fisher	<p>Besides its literal sense ( Luke 5:2 ), this word is also applied by our Lord to his disciples in a figurative sense ( Matthew 4:19 ;  Mark 1:17 ).  </p>
Fish-hooks	<p>were used for catching fish ( Amos 4:2 ; Compare  Isaiah 37:29 ;  Jeremiah 16:16 ;  Ezekiel 29:4 ;  Job 41:1 Job 41:2 ;  Matthew 17:27 ).  </p>
Fishing, the art of	<p>was prosecuted with great industry in the waters of Palestine. It was from the fishing-nets that Jesus called his disciples ( Mark 1:16-20 ), and it was in a fishing-boat he rebuked the winds and the waves ( Matthew 8:26 ) and delivered that remarkable series of prophecies recorded in  Matthew 13 . He twice miraculously fed multitudes with fish and bread ( Matthew 14:19 ;  15:36 ). It was in the mouth of a fish that the tribute-money was found ( Matthew 17:27 ). And he "ate a piece of broiled fish" with his disciples after his resurrection ( Luke 24:42 Luke 24:43 ; Compare  Acts 1:3 ). At the Sea of Tiberias ( John 21:1-14 ), in obedience to his direction, the disciples cast their net "on the right side of the ship," and enclosed so many that "they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes."  </p><p> Two kinds of fishing-nets are mentioned in the New Testament: </p><li> The casting-net ( Matthew 4:18 ;  Mark 1:16 ).  </li><li> The drag-net or seine ( Matthew 13:48 ).  <p> Fish were also caught by the fishing-hook ( Matthew 17:27 ). (See NET .) </p> </li>
Fish-pools	<p>(Cant  7:4 ) should be simply "pools," as in the Revised Version. The reservoirs near Heshbon (q.v.) were probably stocked with fish ( 2 Samuel 2:13 ;  4:12 ;  Isaiah 7:3 ;  Isaiah 22:9 Isaiah 22:11 ).  </p>
Fitches	<p>( Isaiah 28:25 Isaiah 28:27 ), the rendering of the Hebrew <i> ketsah</i> , "without doubt the Nigella sativa, a small annual of the order Ranunculacece, which grows wild in the Mediterranean countries, and is cultivated in Egypt and Syria for its seed." It is rendered in margin of the Revised Version "black cummin." The seeds are used as a condiment. </p><p> In  Ezekiel 4:9  this word is the rendering of the Hebrew <i> kussemeth</i> (incorrectly rendered "rye" in the Authorized Version of  Exodus 9:32  and  Isaiah 28:25 , but "spelt" in the Revised Version). The reading "fitches" here is an error; it should be "spelt."  </p>
Flag	<p>(Heb., or rather Egyptian, ahu,  Job 8:11 ), rendered "meadow" in  Genesis 41:2 Genesis 41:18 ; probably the Cyperus esculentus, a species of rush eaten by cattle, the Nile reed. It also grows in Palestine.  </p><p> In  Exodus 2:3 Exodus 2:5 ,  Isaiah 19:6 , it is the rendering of the Hebrew <i> suph_, a word which occurs frequently in connection with _yam</i> ; as <i> yam suph</i> , to denote the "Red Sea" (q.v.) or the sea of weeds (as this word is rendered,  Jonah 2:5 ). It denotes some kind of sedge or reed which grows in marshy places. (See PAPER,  REED .) </p>
Gaal	<p>loathing, the son of Ebed, in whom the Shechemites "placed their confidence" when they became discontented with Abimelech. He headed the revolution, and led out the men of Shechem against Abimelech; but was defeated, and fled to his own home (Judg.  9:26-46 ). We hear no more of him after this battle.  </p>
Gaash	<p>a shaking, a hill, on the north side of which Joshua was buried ( Joshua 24:30 ;  Judges 2:9 ), in the territory of Ephraim. (See TIMNATH-SERAH.)  </p>
Gabbatha	<p>Gab Baitha, i.e., "the ridge of the house" = "the temple-mound," on a part of which the fortress of Antonia was built. This "temple-mound" was covered with a tesselated "pavement" (Gr. lithostroton, i.e., "stone-paved"). A judgement-seat (bema) was placed on this "pavement" outside the hall of the "praetorium" (q.v.), the judgment-hall ( John 18:28 ;  19:13 ).  </p>
Gabriel	<p>champion of God, used as a proper name to designate the angel who was sent to ( Daniel 8:16 ) to explain the vision of the ram and the he-goat, and to communicate the prediction of the seventy weeks ( Daniel 9:21-27 ).  </p><p> He announced also the birth of John the Baptist ( Luke 1:11 ), and of the Messiah (26). He describes himself in the words, "I am Gabriel, who stand in the presence of God" ( 1:19 ).  </p>
Gad	<p>fortune; luck. </p><li> Jacob's seventh son, by Zilpah, Leah's handmaid, and the brother of Asher ( Genesis 30:11-13 ;  Genesis 46:16 Genesis 46:18 ). In the Authorized Version of  30:11  the words, "A troop cometh: and she called," etc., should rather be rendered, "In fortune [RSV, 'Fortunate']: and she called," etc., or "Fortune cometh," etc.  <p> The tribe of Gad during the march through the wilderness had their place with Simeon and Reuben on the south side of the tabernacle ( Numbers 2:14 ). The tribes of Reuben and Gad continued all through their history to follow the pastoral pursuits of the patriarchs ( Numbers 32:1-5 ).  </p><p> The portion allotted to the tribe of Gad was on the east of Jordan, and comprehended the half of Gilead, a region of great beauty and fertility ( Deuteronomy 3:12 ), bounded on the east by the Arabian desert, on the west by the Jordan ( Joshua 13:27 ), and on the north by the river Jabbok. It thus included the whole of the Jordan valley as far north as to the Sea of Galilee, where it narrowed almost to a point.  </p><p> This tribe was fierce and warlike; they were "strong men of might, men of war for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, their faces the faces of lions, and like roes upon the mountains for swiftness" ( 1 Chronicles 12:8 ;  5:19-22 ). Barzillai ( 2 Samuel 17:27 ) and Elijah ( 1 Kings 17:1 ) were of this tribe. It was carried into captivity at the same time as the other tribes of the northern kingdom by Tiglath-pileser ( 1 Chronicles 5:26 ), and in the time of ( Jeremiah 49:1 ) their cities were inhabited by the Ammonites.  </p></li><li> A prophet who joined David in the "hold," and at whose advice he quitted it for the forest of Hareth ( 1 Chronicles 29:29 ;  2 Chr  29:25 ;  1 Samuel 22:5 ). Many years after we find mention made of him in connection with the punishment inflicted for numbering the people ( 2 Samuel 24:11-19 ;  1 Chronicles 21:9-19 ). He wrote a book called the "Acts of David" ( 1 Chronicles 29:29 ), and assisted in the arrangements for the musical services of the "house of God" ( 2 Chronicles 29:25 ). He bore the title of "the king's seer" ( 2 Samuel 24:11 2 Samuel 24:13 ;  1 Chronicles 21:9 ).   </li>
Gadara	<p>the capital of the Roman province of Peraea. It stood on the summit of a mountain about 6 miles south-east of the Sea of Galilee. ( Mark 5:1 ) and ( Luke 8:26-39 ) describe the miracle of the healing of the demoniac ( [ Matthew 8:28-34 ] says two demoniacs) as having been wrought "in the country of the Gadarenes," thus describing the scene generally. The miracle could not have been wrought at Gadara itself, for between the lake and this town there is the deep, almost impassable ravine of the Hieromax (Jarmuk). It is identified with the modern village of Um-Keis, which is surrounded by very extensive ruins, all bearing testimony to the splendour of ancient Gadara.  </p><p> "The most interesting remains of Gadara are its tombs, which dot the cliffs for a considerable distance round the city, chiefly on the north-east declivity; but many beautifully sculptured sarcophagi are scattered over the surrounding heights. They are excavated in the limestone rock, and consist of chambers of various dimensions, some more than 20 feet square, with recesses in the sides for bodies...The present inhabitants of Um-Keis are all troglodytes, 'dwelling in tombs,' like the poor maniacs of old, and occasionally they are almost as dangerous to unprotected travellers."  </p>
Gadarenes	<p>the inhabitants of Gadara, in Revised Version "Gerasenes" ( Mark 5:1 ;  Luke 8:26 Luke 8:37 ). In  Matthew 8:28  they are called Gergesenes, Revised Version "Gadarenes."  </p>
Gaddi	<p>fortunate, the representative of the tribe of Manasseh among the twelve "spies" sent by Moses to spy the land ( Numbers 13:11 ).  </p>
Gaddiel	<p>fortune (i.e., sent) of God, the representative of the tribe of Zebulum among the twelve spies ( Numbers 13:10 ).  </p>
Gahar	<p>lurking-place, one of the chief of the Nethinim, whose descendants returned to Jerusalem under Zerubbabel ( Ezra 2:47 ).  </p>
Gaius	<p></p><li> A Macedonian, Paul's fellow-traveller, and his host at Corinth when he wrote his Epistle to the ( Romans 16:23 ). He with his household were baptized by Paul ( 1 Corinthians 1:14 ). During a heathen outbreak against Paul at Ephesus the mob seized Gaius and Aristarchus because they could not find Paul, and rushed with them into the theatre. Some have identified this Gaius with No. (2).  </li><li> A man of Derbe who accompanied Paul into Asia on his last journey to Jerusalem  </li><li> A Christain of Asia Minor to whom John addressed his third epistle ( 3 John 1:1 ).   </li>
Galatia	<p>has been called the "Gallia" of the East, Roman writers calling its inhabitants Galli. They were an intermixture of Gauls and Greeks, and hence were called Gallo-Graeci, and the country Gallo-Graecia. The Galatians were in their origin a part of that great Celtic migration which invaded Macedonia about B.C. 280. They were invited by the king of Bithynia to cross over into Asia Minor to assist him in his wars. There they ultimately settled, and being strengthened by fresh accessions of the same clan from Europe, they overran Bithynia, and supported themselves by plundering neighbouring countries. They were great warriors, and hired themselves out as mercenary soldiers, sometimes fighting on both sides in the great battles of the times. They were at length brought under the power of Rome in B.C. 189, and Galatia became a Roman province B.C. 25.  </p><p> This province of Galatia, within the limits of which these Celtic tribes were confined, was the central region of Asia Minor. </p><p> During his second missionary journey Paul, accompanied by Silas and Timothy ( Acts 16:6 ), visited the "region of Galatia," where he was detained by sickness ( Galatians 4:13 ), and had thus the longer opportunity of preaching to them the gospel. On his third journey he went over "all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order" ( Acts 18:23 ). Crescens was sent thither by Paul toward the close of his life ( 2 Timothy 4:10 ).  </p>
Galatians, Epistle to	<p>The genuineness of this epistle is not called in question. Its Pauline origin is universally acknowledged. </p><p> Occasion of. The churches of Galatia were founded by Paul himself ( Acts 16:6 ;  Galatians 1:8 ;  Galatians 4:13 Galatians 4:19 ). They seem to have been composed mainly of converts from heathenism ( 4:8 ), but partly also of Jewish converts, who probably, under the influence of Judaizing teachers, sought to incorporate the rites of Judaism with Christianity, and by their active zeal had succeeded in inducing the majority of the churches to adopt their views ( 1:6 ;  3:1 ). This epistle was written for the purpose of counteracting this Judaizing tendency, and of recalling the Galatians to the simplicity of the gospel, and at the same time also of vindicating Paul's claim to be a divinely-commissioned apostle.  </p><p> Time and place of writing. The epistle was probably written very soon after Paul's second visit to Galatia ( Acts 18:23 ). The references of the epistle appear to agree with this conclusion. The visit to Jerusalem, mentioned in  Galatians 2:1-10 , was identical with that of  Acts 15 , and it is spoken of as a thing of the past, and consequently the epistle was written subsequently to the council of Jerusalem. The similarity between this epistle and that to the Romans has led to the conclusion that they were both written at the same time, namely, in the winter of A.D. 57-8, during Paul's stay in Corinth ( Acts 20:2 Acts 20:3 ). This to the Galatians is written on the urgency of the occasion, tidings having reached him of the state of matters; and that to the Romans in a more deliberate and systematic way, in exposition of the same great doctrines of the gospel.  </p><p> Contents of. The great question discussed is, Was the Jewish law binding on Christians? The epistle is designed to prove against the Jews that men are justified by faith without the works of the law of Moses. After an introductory address ( Galatians 1:1-10 ) the apostle discusses the subjects which had occasioned the epistle. (1) He defends his apostolic authority ( 1:11-19 ;  2:1-14 ); (2) shows the evil influence of the Judaizers in destroying the very essence of the gospel (3 and 4); (3) exhorts the Galatian believers to stand fast in the faith as it is in Jesus, and to abound in the fruits of the Spirit, and in a right use of their Christian freedom ( (5-6:1-10); ); (4) and then concludes with a summary of the topics discussed, and with the benediction.  </p><p> The Epistle to the Galatians and that to the Romans taken together "form a complete proof that justification is not to be obtained meritoriously either by works of morality or by rites and ceremonies, though of divine appointment; but that it is a free gift, proceeding entirely from the mercy of God, to those who receive it by faith in Jesus our Lord." </p><p> In the conclusion of the epistle ( 6:11 ) Paul says, "Ye see how large a letter I have written with mine own hand." It is implied that this was different from his ordinary usage, which was simply to write the concluding salutation with his own hand, indicating that the rest of the epistle was written by another hand. Regarding this conclusion, Lightfoot, in his Commentary on the epistle, says: "At this point the apostle takes the pen from his amanuensis, and the concluding paragraph is written with his own hand. From the time when letters began to be forged in his name ( 2 Thessalonians 2:2 ;  3:17 ) it seems to have been his practice to close with a few words in his own handwriting, as a precaution against such forgeries...In the present case he writes a whole paragraph, summing up the main lessons of the epistle in terse, eager, disjointed sentences. He writes it, too, in large, bold characters (Gr. pelikois grammasin), that his hand-writing may reflect the energy and determination of his soul." (See JUSTIFICATION .) </p>
Galbanum	<p>Heb. helbenah, ( Exodus 30:34 ), one of the ingredients in the holy incense. It is a gum, probably from the Galbanum officinale.  </p>
Galeed	<p>heap of witness, the name of the pile of stones erected by Jacob and Laban to mark the league of friendship into which they entered with each other ( Genesis 31:47 Genesis 31:48 ). This was the name given to the "heap" by Jacob. It is Hebrew, while the name Jegar-sahadutha, given to it by Laban, is Aramaic (Chaldee or Syriac). Probably Nahor's family originally spoke Aramaic, and Abraham and his descendants learned Hebrew, a kindred dialect, in the land of Canaan.  </p>
Galilean	<p>an inhabitant or native of Galilee. This word was used as a name of contempt as applied to our Lord's disciples ( Luke 22:59 ;  Acts 2:7 ). All the apostles, with the exception of Judas Iscariot ( Acts 1:11 ), were Galileans. Peter was detected by his Galilean accent ( Matthew 26:69 ;  Mark 14:70 ).  </p><p> This was also one of the names of reproach given to the early Christians. Julian the Apostate, as he is called, not only used the epithet himself when referring to Christ and his apostles, but he made it a law that no one should ever call the Christians by any other name. </p>
Galilee	<p>circuit. Solomon rewarded Hiram for certain services rendered him by the gift of an upland plain among the mountains of Naphtali. Hiram was dissatisfied with the gift, and called it "the land of Cabul" (q.v.). The Jews called it Galil. It continued long to be occupied by the original inhabitants, and hence came to be called "Galilee of the Gentiles" ( Matthew 4:15 ), and also "Upper Galilee," to distinguish it from the extensive addition afterwards made to it toward the south, which was usually called "Lower Galilee." In the time of our Lord, Galilee embraced more than one-third of Western Palestine, extending "from Dan on the north, at the base of Mount Hermon, to the ridges of Carmel and Gilboa on the south, and from the Jordan valley on the east away across the splendid plains of Jezreel and Acre to the shores of the Mediterranean on the west." Palestine was divided into three provinces, Judea, Samaria, and Galilee, which comprehended the whole northern section of the country ( Acts 9:31 ), and was the largest of the three.  </p><p> It was the scene of some of the most memorable events of Jewish history. Galilee also was the home of our Lord during at least thirty years of his life. The first three Gospels are chiefly taken up with our Lord's public ministry in this province. "The entire province is encircled with a halo of holy associations connected with the life, works, and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth." "It is noteworthy that of his thirty-two beautiful parables, no less than ninteen were spoken in Galilee. And it is no less remarkable that of his entire thirty-three great miracles, twenty-five were wrought in this province. His first miracle was wrought at the wedding in Cana of Galilee, and his last, after his resurrection, on the shore of Galilee's sea. In Galilee our Lord delivered the Sermon on The Mount, and the discourses on 'The Bread of Life,' on 'Purity,' on 'Forgiveness,' and on 'Humility.' In Galilee he called his first disciples; and there occurred the sublime scene of the Transfiguration" (Porter's Through Samaria). </p><p> When the Sanhedrin were about to proceed with some plan for the condemnation of our Lord ( John 7:45-52 ), Nicodemus interposed in his behalf. (Compare  Deuteronomy 1:16 Deuteronomy 1:17 ;  17:8 .) They replied, "Art thou also of Galilee?.... Out of Galilee ariseth no prophet." This saying of theirs was "not historically true, for two prophets at least had arisen from Galilee, Jonah of Gath-hepher, and the greatest of all the prophets, Elijah of Thisbe, and perhaps also Nahum and Hosea. Their contempt for Galilee made them lose sight of historical accuracy" (Alford, Com.).  </p><p> The Galilean accent differed from that of Jerusalem in being broader and more guttural ( Mark 14:70 ).  </p>
Galilee, Sea of	<p>( Matthew 4:18 ;  15:29 ), is mentioned in the Bible under three other names. </p><li> In the Old Testament it is called the "sea of Chinnereth" ( Numbers 34:11 ;  Joshua 12:3 ;  13:27 ), as is supposed from its harp-like shape. (2). The "lake of Gennesareth" once by ( Luke 5:1 ), from the flat district lying on its west coast. </li><li> ( John 6:1 ;  21:1 ) calls it the "sea of Tiberias" (q.v.). The modern Arabs retain this name, Bahr Tabariyeh.  <p> This lake is 12 1/2 miles long, and from 4 to 7 1/2 broad. Its surface is 682 feet below the level of the Mediterranean. Its depth is from 80 to 160 feet. The Jordan enters it 10 1/2 miles below the southern extremity of the Huleh Lake, or about 26 1/2 miles from its source. In this distance of 26 1/2 miles there is a fall in the river of 1,682 feet, or of more than 60 feet to the mile. It is 27 miles east of the Mediterranean, and about 60 miles north-east of Jerusalem. It is of an oval shape, and abounds in fish.  </p><p> Its present appearance is thus described: "The utter loneliness and absolute stillness of the scene are exceedingly impressive. It seems as if all nature had gone to rest, languishing under the scorching heat. How different it was in the days of our Lord! Then all was life and bustle along the shores; the cities and villages that thickly studded them resounded with the hum of a busy population; while from hill-side and corn-field came the cheerful cry of shepherd and ploughman. The lake, too, was dotted with dark fishing-boats and spangled with white sails. Now a mournful, solitary silence reigns over sea and shore. The cities are in ruins!" </p><p> This sea is chiefly of interest as associated with the public ministry of our Lord. Capernaum, "his own city" ( Matthew 9:1 ), stood on its shores. From among the fishermen who plied their calling on its waters he chose Peter and his brother Andrew, and James and John, to be disciples, and sent them forth to be "fishers of men" ( Matthew 4:18 Matthew 4:22 ;  Mark 1:16-20 ;  Luke 5: : 1-11). He stilled its tempest, saying to the storm that swept over it, "Peace, be still" ( Matthew 8:23-27 ;  Mark 7:31-35 ); and here also he showed himself after his resurrection to his disciples ( John 21 ).  </p><p> "The Sea of Galilee is indeed the cradle of the gospel. The subterranean fires of nature prepared a lake basin, through which a river afterwards ran, keeping its waters always fresh. In this basin a vast quantity of shell-fish swarmed, and multiplied to such an extent that they formed the food of an extraordinary profusion of fish. The great variety and abundance of the fish in the lake attracted to its shores a larger and more varied population than existed elsewhere in Palestine, whereby this secluded district was brought into contact with all parts of the world. And this large and varied population, with access to all nations and countries, attracted the Lord Jesus, and induced him to make this spot the centre of his public ministry." </p> </li>
Gall	<p>(1) Heb. mererah, meaning "bitterness" ( Job 16:13 ); i.e., the bile secreted in the liver. This word is also used of the poison of asps ( 20:14 ), and of the vitals, the seat of life (25).  </p><li> Heb. rosh. In  Deuteronomy 32:33  and  Job 20:16  it denotes the poison of serpents. In  Hosea 10:4  the Hebrew word is rendered "hemlock." The original probably denotes some bitter, poisonous plant, most probably the poppy, which grows up quickly, and is therefore coupled with wormwood ( Deuteronomy 29:18 ;  Jeremiah 9:15 ;  Lamentations 3:19 ). Compare  Jeremiah 8:14 ;  23:15 , "water of gall," Gesenius, "poppy juice;" others, "water of hemlock," "bitter water."  </li><li> Gr. chole ( Matthew 27:34 ), the LXX. translation of the Hebrew <i> rosh</i> in  Psalms 69 ;  21 , which foretells our Lord's sufferings. The drink offered to our Lord was vinegar (made of light wine rendered acid, the common drink of Roman soldiers) "mingled with gall," or, according to ( Mark 15:23 ), "mingled with myrrh;" both expressions meaning the same thing, namely, that the vinegar was made bitter by the infusion of wormwood or some other bitter substance, usually given, according to a merciful custom, as an anodyne to those who were crucified, to render them insensible to pain. Our Lord, knowing this, refuses to drink it. He would take nothing to cloud his faculties or blunt the pain of dying. He chooses to suffer every element of woe in the bitter cup of agony given him by the Father ( John 18:11 ).   </li>
Gallery	<p></p><li> Heb. 'attik ( Ezekiel 41:15 Ezekiel 41:16 ), a terrace; a projection; ledge.  </li><li> Heb. rahit (Cant  1:17 ), translated "rafters," marg. "galleries;" probably panel-work or fretted ceiling.   </li>
Gallim	<p>heaps, ( 1 Samuel 25:44 ;  Isaiah 10:30 ). The native place of Phalti, to whom Michal was given by Saul. It was probably in Benjamin, to the north of Jerusalem.  </p>
Gallio	<p>the elder brother of Seneca the philosopher, who was tutor and for some time minister of the emperor Nero. He was "deputy", i.e., proconsul, as in Revised Version, of Achaia, under the emperor Claudius, when Paul visited Corinth ( Acts 18:12 ). The word used here by Luke in describing the rank of Gallio shows his accuracy. Achaia was a senatorial province under Claudius, and the governor of such a province was called a "proconsul." He is spoken of by his contemporaries as "sweet Gallio," and is described as a most popular and affectionate man. When the Jews brought Paul before his tribunal on the charge of persuading "men to worship God contrary to the law" ( 18:13 ), he refused to listen to them, and "drave them from the judgment seat" ( 18:16 ).  </p>
Gallows	<p>Heb. 'ets, meaning "a tree" ( Esther 6:4 ), a post or gibbet. In  Genesis 40:19  and  Deuteronomy 21:22  the word is rendered "tree."  </p>
Gamaliel	<p>reward of God. </p><li> A chief of the tribe of Manasseh at the census at Sinai ( Numbers 1:10 ;  2:20 ;  Numbers 7:54 Numbers 7:59 ).  </li><li> The son of rabbi Simeon, and grandson of the famous rabbi Hillel. He was a Pharisse, and therefore the opponent of the party of the Sadducees. He was noted for his learning, and was president of the Sanhedrim during the regins of Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius, and died, it is said, about eighteen years before the destruction of Jerusalem.  <p> When the apostles were brought before the council, charged with preaching the resurrection of Jesus, as a zealous Pharisee Gamaliel councelled moderation and calmness. By a reference to well-known events, he advised them to "refrain from these men." If their work or counsel was of man, it would come to nothing; but if it was of God, they could not destroy it, and therefore ought to be on their guard lest they should be "found fighting against God" ( Acts 5:34-40 ). Paul was one of his disciples ( 22:3 ).  </p> </li>
Games	<p></p><li> Of children ( Zechariah 8:5 ;  Matthew 11:16 ). The Jewish youth were also apparently instructed in the use of the bow and the sling ( Judges 20:16 ;  1 Chronicles 12:2 ).  </li><li> Public games, such as were common among the Greeks and Romans, were foreign to the Jewish institutions and customs. Reference, however, is made to such games in two passages ( Psalms 19:5 ; Eccl  9:11 ).  </li><li> Among the Greeks and Romans games entered largely into their social life.  <p> (a) Reference in the New Testament is made to gladiatorial shows and fights with wild beasts ( 1 Corinthians 15:32 ). These were common among the Romans, and sometimes on a large scale.  </p><p> (b) Allusion is frequently made to the Grecian gymnastic contests ( Galatians 2:2 ;  5:7 ; Phil  2:16 ;  3:14 ;  1 Timothy 6:12 ;  2 Tim.  2:5 ;  Hebrews 12:1 Hebrews 12:4 Hebrews 12:12 ). These were very numerous. The Olympic, Pythian, Nemean, and Isthmian games were esteemed as of great national importance, and the victors at any of these games of wrestling, racing, etc., were esteemed as the noblest and the happiest of mortals.  </p> </li>
Gammadim	<p>( Ezekiel 27:11 ) brave warriors; RSV marg., "valorous men;" others interpret this word as meaning "short-swordsmen," or "daring ones", the name of a class of men who were defenders of the towers of Tyre.  </p>
Gamul	<p>weaned the leader of one of the priestly courses ( 1 Chronicles 24:17 ).  </p>
Gap	<p>a rent or opening in a wall ( Ezekiel 13:5 ; Compare  Amos 4:3 ). The false prophets did not stand in the gap ( Ezekiel 22: :  30 ), i.e., they did nothing to stop the outbreak of wickedness.  </p>
Gardens	<p>mentioned in Scripture, of Eden ( Genesis 2:8 Genesis 2:9 ); Ahab's garden of herbs ( 1 Kings 21:2 ); the royal garden ( 2 Kings 21:18 ); the royal garden at Susa ( Esther 1:5 ); the garden of Joseph of Arimathea ( John 19:41 ); of Gethsemane ( John 18:1 ).  </p><p> The "king's garden" mentioned  2 Kings 25:4 ,  Nehemiah 3:15 , was near the Pool of Siloam.  </p><p> Gardens were surrounded by hedges of thorns ( Isaiah 5:5 ) or by walls of stone ( Proverbs 24:31 ). "Watch-towers" or "lodges" were also built in them ( Isaiah 1:8 ;  Mark 12:1 ), in which their keepers sat. On account of their retirement they were frequently used as places for secret prayer and communion with God ( Genesis 24:63 ;  Matthew 26:30-36 ;  John 1:48 ;  John 18:1 John 18:2 ). The dead were sometimes buried in gardens ( Genesis 23:19 Genesis 23:20 ;  2 Kings  Genesis 21:18 Genesis 21:26 ;  1 Samuel 25:1 ;  Mark 15:46 ;  John 19:41 ). (See PARADISE .) </p>
Gareb	<p>scabby; itch. </p><li> One of David's warriors ( 2 Samuel 23:38 ), an Ithrite.  </li><li> A hill near Jerusalem ( Jeremiah 31:39 ), probably the hill of lepers, and consequently a place outside the boundary of the city.   </li>
Garlands	<p>( Acts 14:13 ). In heathen sacrifices the victims were adorned with fillets and garlands made of wool, with leaves and flowers interwoven. The altar and the priests and attendants were also in like manner adorned.  </p>
Garlic	<p>(Heb. shum, from its strong odour), mentioned only once ( Numbers 11:5 ). The garlic common in Eastern countries is the Allium sativum or Allium Ascalonicum, so called from its having been brought into Europe from Ascalon by the Crusaders. It is now known by the name of "shallot" or "eschalot."  </p>
Garner	<p></p><li> Heb. 'otsar, a treasure; a store of goods laid up, and hence also the place where they are deposited ( Joel 1:17 ;  2 Chr.  32:27 , rendered "treasury").  </li><li> Heb. mezev, a cell, storeroom ( Psalms 144:13 ); Gr. apotheke, a place for storing anything, a granary ( Matthew 3:12 ;  Luke 3:17 ).   </li>
Garnish	<p>overlay with stones ( 2 Chronicles 3:6 ), adorn ( Revelation 21:19 ), deck with garlands ( Matthew 23:29 ), furnish ( 12:44 ).  </p><p> In  Job 26:13  (Heb. shiphrah, meaning "brightness"), "By his spirit the heavens are brightness" i.e., are bright, splendid, beautiful.  </p>
Garrison	<p></p><li> Heb. matstsab, a station; a place where one stands ( 1 Samuel 14:12 ); a military or fortified post ( 1 Samuel 13:23 ;  1 Samuel 14:1 1 Samuel 14:4 1 Samuel 14:6 , etc.).  </li><li> Heb. netsib, a prefect, superintendent; hence a military post ( 1 Samuel 10:5 ;  1 Samuel 13:3 1 Samuel 13:4 ;  2 Sam  8:6 ). This word has also been explained to denote a pillar set up to mark the Philistine conquest, or an officer appointed to collect taxes; but the idea of a military post seems to be the correct one.  </li><li> Heb. matstsebah, properly a monumental column; improperly rendered pl. "garrisons" in  Ezekiel 26:11 ; correctly in Revised Version "pillars," marg. "obelisks," probably an idolatrous image.   </li>
Gate	<p></p><li> Of cities, as of Jerusalem ( Jeremiah 37:13 ;  Nehemiah 1:3 ;  2:3 ;  3:3 ), of Sodom ( Genesis 19:1 ), of Gaza ( Judges 16:3 ).  </li><li> Of royal palaces ( Nehemiah 2:8 ).  </li><li> Of the temple of Solomon ( 1 Kings 6:34 1 Kings 6:35 ;  2 Kings  18:16 ); of the holy place ( 1 Kings 6:31 1 Kings 6:32 ;  Ezekiel 41:23 Ezekiel 41:24 ); of the outer courts of the temple, the beautiful gate ( Acts 3:2 ).  </li><li> Tombs ( Matthew 27:60 ).  </li><li> Prisons ( Acts 12:10 ;  16:27 ).  </li><li> Caverns ( 1 Kings 19:13 ).  </li><li> Camps ( Exodus 32:26 Exodus 32:27 ;  Hebrews 13:12 ).  <p> The materials of which gates were made were, </p></li><li> Iron and brass ( Psalms 107:16 ;  Isaiah 45:2 ;  Acts 12:10 ).  </li><li> Stones and pearls ( Isaiah 54:12 ;  Revelation 21:21 ).  </li><li> Wood ( Judges 16:3 ) probably.  <p> At the gates of cities courts of justice were frequently held, and hence "judges of the gate" are spoken of ( Deuteronomy 16:18 ;  17:8 ;  21:19 ;  Deuteronomy 25:6 Deuteronomy 25:7 , etc.). At the gates prophets also frequently delivered their messages ( Proverbs 1:21 ;  8:3 ;  Isaiah 29:21 ;  Jeremiah 17:19 Jeremiah 17:20 ;  26:10 ). Criminals were punished without the gates ( 1 Kings 21:13 ;  Acts 7:59 ). By the "gates of righteousness" we are probably to understand those of the temple ( Psalms 118:19 ). "The gates of hell" (RSV, "gates of Hades")  Matthew 16:18 , are generally interpreted as meaning the power of Satan, but probably they may mean the power of death, denoting that the Church of Christ shall never die.  </p> </li>
Gath	<p>a wine-vat, one of the five royal cities of the Philistines ( Joshua 13:3 ) on which the ark brought calamity ( 1 Samuel 5:8 1 Samuel 5:9 ;  6:17 ). It was famous also as being the birthplace or residence of Goliath ( 1 Samuel 17:4 ). David fled from Saul to Achish, king of Gath ( 1 Samuel 21:10 ;  27:2-4 ;  Psalms 56 ), and his connection with it will account for the words in  2 Samuel 1:20 . It was afterwards conquered by David ( 2 Samuel 8:1 ). It occupied a strong position on the borders of Judah and Philistia ( 1 Samuel 21:10 ;  1 Chronicles 18:1 ). Its site has been identified with the hill called Tell esSafieh, the Alba Specula of the Middle Ages, which rises 695 feet above the plain on its east edge. It is noticed on monuments about B.C. 1500. (See METHEGAMMAH .) </p>
Gath-hepher	<p>wine-press of the well, a town of Lower Galilee, about 5 miles from Nazareth; the birthplace of Jonah ( 2 Kings 14:25 ); the same as Gittah-hepher ( Joshua 19:13 ). It has been identified with the modern el-Meshed, a village on the top of a rocky hill. Here the supposed tomb of Jonah, Neby Yunas, is still pointed out.  </p>
Gath-rimmon	<p>press of the pomegranate. </p><li> A Levitical city in the tribe of Dan ( Joshua 19:45 ;  21:24 ;  1 Chronicles 6:69 ).  </li><li> Another city of the same name in Manasseh, west of the Jordan ( Joshua 21:25 ), called also Bileam ( 1 Chronicles 6:70 ).   </li>
Gaulanitis	<p>a name derived from "Golan" (q.v.), one of the cities of refuge in the territory of Manasseh ( Joshua 20:8 ;  21:27 ;  Deuteronomy 4:43 ). This was one of the provinces ruled by Herod Antipas. It lay to the east of the Lake of Galilee, and included among its towns Bethsaida-Julias ( Mark 8:22 ) and Seleucia.  </p>
Gaza	<p>called also Azzah, which is its Hebrew name ( Deuteronomy 2:23 ;  1 Kings 4:24 ;  Jeremiah 25:20 ), strong, a city on the Mediterranean shore, remarkable for its early importance as the chief centre of a great commercial traffic with Egypt. It is one of the oldest cities of the world ( Genesis 10:19 ;  Joshua 15:47 ). Its earliest inhabitants were the Avims, who were conquered and displaced by the Caphtorims ( Deuteronomy 2:23 ;  Joshua 13:2 Joshua 13:3 ), a Philistine tribe. In the division of the land it fell to the lot of Judah ( Joshua 15:47 ;  Judges 1:18 ). It was the southernmost of the five great Philistine cities which gave each a golden emerod as a trespass-offering unto the Lord ( 1 Samuel 6:17 ). Its gates were carried away by Samson ( Judges 16:1-3 ). Here he was afterwards a prisoner, and "did grind in the prison house." Here he also pulled down the temple of Dagon, and slew "all the lords of the Philistines," himself also perishing in the ruin (Judg.  16:21-30 ). The prophets denounce the judgments of God against it ( Jeremiah 25:20 ;  47:5 ;  Amos 1:6 Amos 1:7 ;  Zephaniah 2:4 ). It is referred to in  Acts 8:26 . Philip is here told to take the road from Jerusalem to Gaza (about 6 miles south-west of Jerusalem), "which is desert", i.e., the "desert road," probably by Hebron, through the desert hills of Southern Judea. (See SAMSON .) </p><p> It is noticed on monuments as early as B.C. 1600. Its small port is now called el-Mineh.  </p>
Geba	<p>the hill, ( 2 Samuel 5:25  [  1 Chronicles 14:16 , "Gibeon"];  2 Kings 23:8 ;  Nehemiah 11:31 ), a Levitical city of Benjamin ( 1 Kings 15:22 ;  1 Samuel 13:16 ;  14:5 , wrongly "Gibeah" in the A.V.), on the north border of Judah near Gibeah ( Isaiah 10:29 ;  Joshua 18:24 Joshua 18:28 ). "From Geba to Beersheba" expressed the whole extent of the kingdom of Judah, just as "from Dan to Beersheba" described the whole length of Palestine ( 2 Kings 23:8 ). It has been identified with Gaba ( Joshua 18:24 ;  Ezra 2:26 ;  Nehemiah 7:30 ), now Jeb'a, about 5 1/2 miles north of Jerusalem.  </p>
Gebal	<p>a line (or natural boundary, as a mountain range). </p><li> A tract in the land of Edom south of the Dead Sea ( Psalms 83:7 ); now called Djebal.  </li><li> A Phoenician city, not far from the sea coast, to the north of Beyrout ( Ezekiel 27:9 ); called by the Greeks Byblos. Now Jibeil. Mentioned in the Amarna tablets.  <p> An important Phoenician text, referring to the temple of Baalath, on a monument of Yehu-melek, its king (probably B.C. 600), has been discovered.  </p> </li>
Gebalites	<p>( 1 Kings 5:18  RSV, in A.V. incorrectly rendered, after the Targum, "stone-squarers," but marg. "Giblites"), the inhabitants of Gebal (2).  </p>
Geber	<p>a valiant man, ( 1 Kings 4:19 ), one of Solomon's purveyors, having jurisdiction over a part of Gilead, comprising all the kingdom of Sihon and part of the kingdom of Og ( Deuteronomy 2 ;  31 ).  </p>
Gebim	<p>cisterns, (rendered "pits,"  Jeremiah 14:3 ; "locusts,"  Isaiah 33:4 ), a small place north of Jerusalem, whose inhabitants fled at the approach of the Assyrian army ( Isaiah 10:31 ). It is probably the modern el-Isawiyeh.  </p>
Gedaliah	<p>made great by Jehovah. </p><li> the son of Jeduthum ( 1 Chronicles 25:3 1 Chronicles 25:9 ). </li><li> The grandfather of the prophet Zephaniah, and the father of Cushi ( Zephaniah 1:1 ). </li><li> One of the Jewish nobles who conspired against Jeremiah ( Jeremiah 38:1 ). </li><li> The son of Ahikam, and grandson of Shaphan, secretary of king Josiah ( Jeremiah 26:24 ). After the destruction of Jerusalem (see ZEDEKIAH), Nebuchadnezzar left him to govern the country as tributary to him ( 2 Kings 25:22 ;  Jeremiah 40:5 ;  52:16 ). Ishmael, however, at the head of a party of the royal family, "Jewish irreconcilables", rose against him, and slew him and "all the Jews that were with him" ( Jeremiah 41:2 Jeremiah 41:3 ) at Mizpah about three months after the destruction of Jerusalem. He and his band also plundered the town of Mizpah, and carried off many captives. He was, however, overtaken by Johanan and routed. He fled with such of his followers as escaped to the Ammonites ( 41:15 ). The little remnant of the Jews now fled to Egypt.   </li>
Geder	<p>a walled place, ( Joshua 12:13 ), perhaps the same as Gederah or Gedor ( 15:58 ).  </p>
Gederah	<p>the fortress; a fortified place, a town in the plain (shephelah) of Judah ( Joshua 15:36 ). This is a very common Canaanite and Phoenician name. It is the feminine form of Geder ( 12:13 ); the plural form is Gederoth ( 15:41 ). This place has by some been identified with Jedireh, a ruin 9 miles from Lydda, toward Eleutheropolis, and 4 miles north of Sur'ah (Zorah), in the valley of Elah.  </p>
Gederathite	<p>an epithet applied to Josabad, one of David's warriors at Ziklag ( 1 Chronicles 12:4 ), a native of Gederah.  </p>
Gedor	<p>a wall. </p><li> A city in the mountains or hill country of Judah ( Joshua 15:58 ), identified with Jedar, between Jerusalem and Hebron.  </li><li> 1 Chronicles 4:39 , the Gederah of  Joshua 15:36 , or the well-known Gerar, as the LXX. read, where the patriarchs of old had sojourned and fed their flocks ( Genesis 20:1 Genesis 20:14 Genesis 20:15 ;  Genesis 26:1 Genesis 26:6 Genesis 26:14 ).  </li><li> A town apparently in Benjamin ( 1 Chronicles 12:7 ), the same probably as Geder ( Joshua 12:13 ).   </li>
Gehazi	<p>valley of vision, Elisha's trusted servant ( 2 Kings 4:31 ;  5:25 ;  2 Kings 8:4 2 Kings 8:5 ). He appears in connection with the history of the Shunammite ( 2 Kings 4:14 2 Kings 4:31 ) and of Naaman the Syrian. On this latter occasion he was guilty of duplicity and dishonesty of conduct, causing Elisha to denounce his crime with righteous sternness, and pass on him the terrible doom that the leprosy of Naaman would cleave to him and his for ever ( 5:20-27 ).  </p><p> He afterwards appeared before king Joram, to whom he recounted the great deeds of his master ( 2 Kings 8:1-6 ).  </p>
Gehenna	<p>(originally Ge bene Hinnom; i.e., "the valley of the sons of Hinnom"), a deep, narrow glen to the south of Jerusalem, where the idolatrous Jews offered their children in sacrifice to Molech ( 2 Chronicles 28:3 ;  33:6 ;  Jeremiah 7:31 ;  19:2-6 ). This valley afterwards became the common receptacle for all the refuse of the city. Here the dead bodies of animals and of criminals, and all kinds of filth, were cast and consumed by fire kept always burning. It thus in process of time became the image of the place of everlasting destruction. In this sense it is used by our Lord in  Matthew 5:22 Matthew 5:29 Matthew 5:30 ;  10:28 ;  18:9 ;  Matthew 23:15 Matthew 23:33 ;  Mark 9:43 Mark 9:45 Mark 9:47 ;  Luke 12:5 . In these passages, and also in  James 3:6 , the word is uniformly rendered "hell," the Revised Version placing "Gehenna" in the margin. (See HELL;  HINNOM .) </p>
Geliloth	<p>circles; regions, a place in the border of Benjamin ( Joshua 18:17 ); called Gilgal in  15:7 .  </p>
Gemariah	<p>Jehovah has made perfect. </p><li> The son of Shaphan, and one of the Levites of the temple in the time of Jehoiakim ( Jeremiah 36:10 ;  2 Kings  22:12 ). Baruch read aloud to the people from Gemariah's chamber, and again in the hearing of Gemariah and other scribes, the prophecies of Jeremiah ( Jeremiah 36:11-20 ), which filled him with terror. He joined with others in entreating the king not to destroy the roll of the prophecies which Baruch had read (21-25).  </li><li> The son of Hilkiah, who accompanied Shaphan with the tribute-money from Zedekiah to Nebuchadnezzar, and was the bearer at the same time of a letter from Jeremiah to the Jewish captives at Babylon ( Jeremiah 29:3 Jeremiah 29:4 ).   </li>
Generation	<p> Genesis 2:4 , "These are the generations," means the "history."  5:1 , "The book of the generations," means a family register, or history of Adam  37:2 , "The generations of Jacob" = the history of Jacob and his descendants  7:1 , "In this generation" = in this age.  Psalms 49:19 , "The generation of his fathers" = the dwelling of his fathers, i.e., the grave.  Psalms 73:15 , "The generation of thy children" = the contemporary race.  Isaiah 53:8 , "Who shall declare his generation?" = His manner of life who shall declare? or rather = His race, posterity, shall be so numerous that no one shall be able to declare it.  </p><p> In  Matthew 1:17 , the word means a succession or series of persons from the same stock.  Matthew 3:7 , "Generation of vipers" = brood of vipers  24:34 , "This generation" = the persons then living contemporary with Christ.  1 Peter 2:9 , "A chosen generation" = a chosen people.  </p><p> The Hebrews seem to have reckoned time by the generation. In the time of Abraham a generation was an hundred years, thus:  Genesis 15:16 , "In the fourth generation" = in four hundred years (Compare verse 13 and  Exodus 12:40 ). In  Deuteronomy 1:35  and  2:14  a generation is a period of thirty-eight years.  </p>
Genesis	<p>The five books of Moses were collectively called the Pentateuch, a word of Greek origin meaning "the five-fold book." The Jews called them the Torah, i.e., "the law." It is probable that the division of the Torah into five books proceeded from the Greek translators of the Old Testament. The names by which these several books are generally known are Greek. </p><p> The first book of the Pentateuch (q.v.) is called by the Jews Bereshith, i.e., "in the beginning", because this is the first word of the book. It is generally known among Christians by the name of Genesis, i.e., "creation" or "generation," being the name given to it in the LXX. as designating its character, because it gives an account of the origin of all things. It contains, according to the usual computation, the history of about two thousand three hundred and sixty-nine years. </p><p> Genesis is divided into two principal parts. The first part (1-11) gives a general history of mankind down to the time of the Dispersion. The second part presents the early history of Israel down to the death and burial of Joseph (12-50).  </p><p> There are five principal persons brought in succession under our notice in this book, and around these persons the history of the successive periods is grouped, viz., Adam (1-3), Noah (4-9), Abraham ( (10-25:18), ), Isaac ( (25:19-35:29), ), and Jacob (36-50).  </p><p> In this book we have several prophecies concerning Christ ( 3:15 ;  12:3 ;  18:18 ;  22:18 ;  26:4 ;  28:14 ;  <span class="badLink">49:10</span> ). The author of this book was Moses. Under divine guidance he may indeed have been led to make use of materials already existing in primeval documents, or even of traditions in a trustworthy form that had come down to his time, purifying them from all that was unworthy; but the hand of Moses is clearly seen throughout in its composition.  </p>
Gennesaret	<p>a garden of riches. </p><li> A town of Naphtali, called Chinnereth ( Joshua 19:35 ), sometimes in the plural form Chinneroth ( 11:2 ). In later times the name was gradually changed to Genezar and Gennesaret ( Luke 5:1 ). This city stood on the western shore of the lake to which it gave its name. No trace of it remains. The plain of Gennesaret has been called, from its fertility and beauty, "the Paradise of Galilee." It is now called el-Ghuweir.  </li><li> The Lake of Gennesaret, the Grecized form of CHINNERETH (q.v.). (See GALILEE, SEA  OF .)  </li>
Gentiles	<p>(Heb., usually in plural, goyim), meaning in general all nations except the Jews. In course of time, as the Jews began more and more to pride themselves on their peculiar privileges, it acquired unpleasant associations, and was used as a term of contempt. </p><p> In the New Testament the Greek word Hellenes, meaning literally Greek (as in  Acts 16:1 Acts 16:3 ;  18:17 ;  Romans 1:14 ), generally denotes any non-Jewish nation.  </p>
Genubath	<p>theft, the son of Hadad, of the Edomitish royal family. He was brought up in Pharaoh's household. His mother was a sister of Tahpenes, the king of Egypt's wife, mentioned in  1 Kings 11:20 .  </p>
Gera	<p>grain. </p><li> The son of Bela and grandson of Benjamin ( 1 Chronicles 8:3 1 Chronicles 8:5 1 Chronicles 8:7 ).  </li><li> The father of Ehud the judge ( Judges 3:15 ).  </li><li> The father of Shimei, who so grossly abused David ( 2 Samuel 16:5 ;  2 Samuel 19:16 2 Samuel 19:18 ).   </li>
Gerah	<p>a bean, probably of the carob tree, the smallest weight, and also the smallest piece of money, among the Hebrews, equal to the twentieth part of a shekel ( Exodus 30:13 ;  Leviticus 27:25 ;  Numbers 3:47 ). This word came into use in the same way as our word "grain," from a grain of wheat.  </p>
Gerar	<p>a region; lodging-place, a very ancient town and district in the south border of Palestine, which was ruled over by a king named Abimelech ( Genesis 10:19 ;  Genesis 20:1 Genesis 20:2 ). Abraham sojourned here, and perhaps Isaac was born in this place. Both of these patriarchs were guilty of the sin of here denying their wives, and both of them entered into a treaty with the king before they departed to Beersheba ( 21:23-34 ;  26 ). It seems to have been a rich pastoral country ( 2 Chronicles 14:12-18 ). Isaac here reaped an hundred-fold, and was blessed of God ( Genesis 26:12 ). The "valley of Gerar" ( Genesis 26:17 ) was probably the modern Wady el-Jerdr.  </p>
Gergesa	<p>=Gerasa, identified with the modern Khersa, "over against Galilee," close to the lake. This was probably the scene of the miracle,  Mark 5:1-20 , etc. "From the base of the great plateau of Bashan, 2,000 feet or more overhead, the ground slopes down steeply, in places precipitously, to the shore. And at the foot of the declivity a bold spur runs out to the water's edge. By it the frantic swine would rush on headlong into the lake and perish." Porter's Through Samaria. (See GADARA .) </p>
Gerizim	<p>a mountain of Samaria, about 3,000 feet above the Mediterranean. It was on the left of the valley containing the ancient town of Shechem (q.v.), on the way to Jerusalem. It stood over against Mount Ebal, the summits of these mountains being distant from each other about 2 miles ( Deuteronomy 27 ;  Joshua 8:30-35 ). On the slopes of this mountain the tribes descended from the handmaids of Leah and Rachel, together with the tribe of Reuben, were gathered together, and gave the responses to the blessing pronounced as the reward of obedience, when Joshua in the valley below read the whole law in the hearing of all the people; as those gathered on Ebal responded with a loud Amen to the rehearsal of the curses pronounced on the disobedient. It was probably at this time that the coffin containing the embalmed body of Joseph was laid in the "parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor" ( Genesis 33:19 ;  50:25 ).  </p><p> Josephus relates (Ant  Genesis 11:8 Genesis 11:2-4 ) that Sanballat built a temple for the Samaritans on this mountain, and instituted a priesthood, as rivals to those of the Jews at Jerusalem. This temple was destroyed after it had stood two hundred years. It was afterwards rebuilt by Herod the Great. There is a Samaritan tradition that it was the scene of the incident recorded in  Genesis 22 . There are many ruins on this mountain, some of which are evidently of Christian buildings. To this mountain the woman of Sychar referred in  John 4:20 . For centuries Gerizim was the centre of political outbreaks. The Samaritans (q.v.), a small but united body, still linger here, and keep up their ancient ceremonial worship.  </p>
Gershom	<p>expulsion. </p><li> The eldest son of Levi ( 1 Chronicles 6:16 1 Chronicles 6:17 1 Chronicles 6:20 1 Chronicles 6:43 1 Chronicles 6:62 1 Chronicles 6:71 ; 15:7)=GERSHON (q.v.).  </li><li> The elder of the two sons of Moses born to him in Midian ( Exodus 2:22 ;  18:3 ). On his way to Egypt with his family, in obedience to the command of the Lord, Moses was attacked by a sudden and dangerous illness ( 4:24-26 ), which Zipporah his wife believed to have been sent because he had neglected to circumcise his son. She accordingly took a "sharp stone" and circumcised her son Gershom, saying, "Surely a bloody husband art thou to me", i.e., by the blood of her child she had, as it were, purchased her husband, had won him back again.  </li><li> A descendant of Phinehas who returned with Ezra from Babylon ( Ezra 8:2 ).  </li><li> The son of Manasseh ( Judges 18:30 ), in RSV "of Moses."   </li>
Gershon	<p>=Ger'shom expulsion, the eldest of Levi's three sons ( Genesis 46:11 ;  Exodus 6:16 ).  </p><p> In the wilderness the sons of Gershon had charge of the fabrics of the tabernacle when it was moved from place to place, the curtains, veils, tent-hangings ( Numbers 3: :  2126 -26). Thirteen Levitical cities fell to the lot of the Gershonites ( Joshua 21:27-33 ).  </p>
Geshem	<p>or Gashmu, firmness, probably chief of the Arabs south of Palestine, one of the enemies of the Jews after the return from Babylon ( Nehemiah 2:19 ;  Nehemiah 6:1 Nehemiah 6:2 ). He united with Sanballat and Tobiah in opposing the rebuilding of the wall of Jerusalem.  </p>
Geshur	<p>bridge, the name of a district or principality of Syria near Gilead, between Mount Hermon and the Lake of Tiberias ( 2 Samuel 15:8 ;  1 Chronicles 2:23 ). The Geshurites probably inhabited the rocky fastness of Argob, the modern Lejah, in the north-east corner of Bashan. In the time of David it was ruled by Talmai, whose daughter he married, and who was the mother of Absalom, who fled to Geshur after the murder of Amnon ( 2 Samuel 13:37 ).  </p>
Geshurites	<p></p><li> The inhabitants of Geshur. They maintained friendly relations with the Israelites on the east of Jordan ( Joshua 12:5 ;  Joshua 13:11 Joshua 13:13 ).  </li><li> Another aboriginal people of Palestine who inhabited the south-west border of the land. Geshuri in  Joshua 13:2  should be "the Geshurite," not the Geshurites mentioned in ver. 11,13, but the tribe mentioned in  1 Samuel 27:8 .   </li>
Gethsemane	<p>oil-press, the name of an olive-yard at the foot of the Mount of Olives, to which Jesus was wont to retire ( Luke 22:39 ) with his disciples, and which is specially memorable as being the scene of his agony ( Mark 14:32 ;  John 18:1 ;  Luke 22:44 ). The plot of ground pointed out as Gethsemane is now surrounded by a wall, and is laid out as a modern European flower-garden. It contains eight venerable olive-trees, the age of which cannot, however, be determined. The exact site of Gethsemane is still in question. Dr. Thomson (The Land and the Book) says: "When I first came to Jerusalem, and for many years afterward, this plot of ground was open to all whenever they chose to come and meditate beneath its very old olivetrees. The Latins, however, have within the last few years succeeded in gaining sole possession, and have built a high wall around it...The Greeks have invented another site a little to the north of it...My own impression is that both are wrong. The position is too near the city, and so close to what must have always been the great thoroughfare eastward, that our Lord would scarcely have selected it for retirement on that dangerous and dismal night...I am inclined to place the garden in the secluded vale several hundred yards to the north-east of the present Gethsemane."  </p>
Gezer	<p>a precipice, an ancient royal Canaanitish city ( Joshua 10:33 ;  12:12 ). It was allotted with its suburbs to the Kohathite Levites ( 21:21 ;  1 Chronicles 6:67 ). It stood between the lower Beth-horon and the sea ( Joshua 16:3 ;  1 Kings 9:17 ). It was the last point to which David pursued the Philistines ( 2 Samuel 5:25 ;  1 Chronicles 14:16 ) after the battle of Baal-perazim. The Canaanites retained possession of it till the time of Solomon, when the king of Egypt took it and gave it to Solomon as a part of the dowry of the Egyptian princess whom he married ( 1 Kings 9:15-17 ). It is identified with Tell el-Jezer, about 10 miles south-west of Beth-horon. It is mentioned in the Amarna tablets.  </p>
Ghost	<p>an old Saxon word equivalent to soul or spirit. It is the translation of the Hebrew <i> nephesh_ and the Greek _pneuma</i> , both meaning "breath," "life," "spirit," the "living principle" ( Job 11:20 ;  Jeremiah 15:9 ;  Matthew 27:50 ;  John 19:30 ). The expression "to give up the ghost" means to die ( Lamentations 1:19 ;  Genesis 25:17 ;  35:29 ;  49:33 ;  Job 3:11 ). (See HOLY  GHOST .) </p>
Giants	<p></p><li> Heb. nephilim, meaning "violent" or "causing to fall" ( Genesis 6:4 ). These were the violent tyrants of those days, those who fell upon others. The word may also be derived from a root signifying "wonder," and hence "monsters" or "prodigies." In  Numbers 13:33  this name is given to a Canaanitish tribe, a race of large stature, "the sons of Anak." The Revised Version, in these passages, simply transliterates the original, and reads "Nephilim."  </li><li> Heb. rephaim, a race of giants ( Deuteronomy 3:11 ) who lived on the east of Jordan, from whom Og was descended. They were probably the original inhabitants of the land before the immigration of the Canaanites. They were conquered by Chedorlaomer ( Genesis 14:5 ), and their territories were promised as a possession to Abraham ( 15:20 ). The Anakim, Zuzim, and Emim were branches of this stock.  <p> In  Job 26:5  (RSV, "they that are deceased;" marg., "the shades," the "Rephaim") and  Isaiah 14:9  this Hebrew word is rendered (A.V.) "dead." It means here "the shades," the departed spirits in Sheol. In Sam  Isaiah 21:16  Isaiah 21:18  <span class="badLink">Isaiah 21:20</span>  Isaiah 21:33 , "the giant" is (A.V.) the rendering of the singular form <i> ha raphah</i> , which may possibly be the name of the father of the four giants referred to here, or of the founder of the Rephaim. The Vulgate here reads "Arapha," whence Milton (in Samson Agonistes) has borrowed the name "Harapha." (See also  1 Chronicles 20:5 1 Chronicles 20:6 1 Chronicles 20:8 ;  Deuteronomy 2:11 Deuteronomy 2:20 ;  3:13 ;  Joshua 15:8 , etc., where the word is similarly rendered "giant.") It is rendered "dead" in (A.V.)  Psalms 88:10 ;  Proverbs 2:18 ;  9:18 ;  21:16 : in all these places the Revised Version marg. has "the shades." (See also  Isaiah 26:14 .)  </p></li><li> Heb. 'Anakim ( Deuteronomy 2:10 Deuteronomy 2:11 Deuteronomy 2:21 ;  Joshua 11:21 Joshua 11:22 ;  Joshua 14:12 Joshua 14:15 ; called "sons of Anak,"  Numbers 13:33 ; "children of Anak,"  13:22 ;  Joshua 15:14 ), a nomad race of giants descended from Arba ( Joshua 14:15 ), the father of Anak, that dwelt in the south of Palestine near Hebron ( Genesis 23:2 ;  Joshua 15:13 ). They were a Cushite tribe of the same race as the Philistines and the Egyptian shepherd kings. David on several occasions encountered them ( 2 Samuel 21:15-22 ). From this race sprung Goliath ( 1 Samuel 17:4 ).  </li><li> Heb. 'emin, a warlike tribe of the ancient Canaanites. They were "great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims" ( Genesis 14:5 ;  Deuteronomy 2:10 Deuteronomy 2:11 ).  </li><li> Heb. Zamzummim (q.v.),  Deuteronomy 2:20  so called by the Amorites.  </li><li> Heb. gibbor ( Job 16:14 ), a mighty one, i.e., a champion or hero. In its plural form (gibborim) it is rendered "mighty men" ( 2 Samuel 23:8-39 ;  1 Kings 1:8 ;  1 Chronicles 11:9-47 ;  29:24 .) The band of six hundred whom David gathered around him when he was a fugitive were so designated. They were divided into three divisions of two hundred each, and thirty divisions of twenty each. The captians of the thirty divisions were called "the thirty," the captains of the two hundred "the three," and the captain over the whole was called "chief among the captains" ( 2 Samuel 23:8 ). The sons born of the marriages mentioned in  Genesis 6:4  are also called by this Hebrew name.   </li>
Gibbethon	<p>a height, a city of the Philistines in the territory of Dan, given to the Kohathites ( Joshua 19:44 ;  21:23 ). Nadab the king of Israel, while besieging it, was slain under its walls by Baasha, one of his own officers ( 1 Kings 15:27 ). It was in the possession of the Philistines after the secession of the ten tribes ( 2 Chronicles 11:13 2 Chronicles 11:14 ).  </p>
Gibeah	<p>a hill or hill-town, "of Benjamin" ( 1 Samuel 13:15 ), better known as "Gibeah of Saul" ( 11:4 ;  Isaiah 10:29 ). It was here that the terrible outrage was committed on the Levite's concubine which led to the almost utter extirpation of the tribe of Benjamin (Judg. 19; 20), only six hundred men surviving after a succession of disastrous battles. This was the birthplace of Saul, and continued to be his residence after he became king ( 1 Samuel 10:26 ;  11:4 ;  15:34 ). It was reckoned among the ancient sanctuaries of Palestine ( 10:26 ;  15:34 ;  23:19 ;  26:1 ;  2 Sam.  21:6-10 ), and hence it is called "Gibeah of God" ( 1 Samuel 10:5 , RSV marg.). It has been identified with the modern Tell el-Ful (i.e., "hill of the bean"), about 3 miles north of Jerusalem.  </p>
Gibeah of Judah	<p>( Joshua 15:57 ), a city in the mountains of Judah, the modern Jeba, on a hill in the Wady Musurr, about 7 1/2 miles west-south-west of Bethlehem.  </p>
Gibeah of Phinehas	<p>( Joshua 15:57 , RSV marg.), a city on Mount Ephraim which had been given to Phinehas ( (24:33  "hill," A.V.; RSV marg. and Heb., "Gibeah."). Here Eleazar the son of Aaron was buried. It has been identified with the modern Khurbet Jibia, 5 miles north of Guphna towards Shechem.  </p>
Gibeah-haaraloth	<p>( Joshua 5:3 , marg.), hill of the foreskins, a place at Gilgal where those who had been born in the wilderness were circumcised. All the others, i.e., those who were under twenty years old at the time of the sentence at Kadesh, had already been circumcised.  </p>
Gibeon	<p>hill-city, "one of the royal cities, greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty" ( Joshua 10:2 ). Its inhabitants were Hivites ( 11:19 ). It lay within the territory of Benjamin, and became a priest-city ( 18:25 ;  21:17 ). Here the tabernacle was set up after the destruction of Nob, and here it remained many years till the temple was built by Solomon. It is represented by the modern el-Jib, to the south-west of Ai, and about 5 1/2 miles north-north-west of Jerusalem.  </p><p> A deputation of the Gibeonites, with their allies from three other cities ( <span class="badLink">Joshua 917</span> ;17), visited the camp at Gilgal, and by false representations induced Joshua to enter into a league with them, although the Israelites had been specially warned against any league with the inhabitants of Canaan ( Exodus 23:32 ;  34:12 ;  Numbers 33:55 ;  Deuteronomy 7:2 ). The deception practised on Joshua was detected three days later; but the oath rashly sworn "by Jehovah God of Israel" was kept, and the lives of the Gibeonites were spared. They were, however, made "bondmen" to the sanctuary ( Joshua 9:23 ).  </p><p> The most remarkable incident connected with this city was the victory Joshua gained over the kings of Palestine ( Joshua 10:16-27 ). The battle here fought has been regarded as "one of the most important in the history of the world." The kings of southern Canaan entered into a confederacy against Gibeon (because it had entered into a league with Joshua) under the leadership of Adoni-zedec, king of Jerusalem, and marched upon Gibeon with the view of taking possession of it. The Gibeonites entreated Joshua to come to their aid with the utmost speed. His army came suddenly upon that of the Amorite kings as it lay encamped before the city. It was completely routed, and only broken remnants of their great host found refuge in the fenced cities. The five confederate kings who led the army were taken prisoners, and put to death at Makkedah (q.v.). This eventful battle of Beth-horon sealed the fate of all the cities of Southern Palestine. Among the Amarna tablets is a letter from Adoni-zedec (q.v.) to the king of Egypt, written probably at Makkedah after the defeat, showing that the kings contemplated flight into Egypt.  </p><p> This place is again brought into notice as the scene of a battle between the army of Ish-bosheth under Abner and that of David led by Joab. At the suggestion of Abner, to spare the effusion of blood twelve men on either side were chosen to decide the battle. The issue was unexpected; for each of the men slew his fellow, and thus they all perished. The two armies then engaged in battle, in which Abner and his host were routed and put to flight ( 2 Samuel 2:12-17 ). This battle led to a virtual truce between Judah and Israel, Judah, under David, increasing in power; and Israel, under Ish-bosheth, continually losing ground.  </p><p> Soon after the death of Absalom and David's restoration to his throne his kingdom was visited by a grievous famine, which was found to be a punishment for Saul's violation ( 2 Samuel 21:2 2 Samuel 21:5 ) of the covenant with the Gibeonites ( Joshua 9:3-27 ). The Gibeonites demanded blood for the wrong that had been done to them, and accordingly David gave up to them the two sons of Rizpah (q.v.) and the five sons of Michal, and these the Gibeonites took and hanged or crucified "in the hill before the Lord" ( 2 Samuel 21:9 ); and there the bodies hung for six months ( 21:10 ), and all the while Rizpah watched over the blackening corpses and "suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night." David afterwards removed the bones of Saul and Jonathan at Jabeshgilead ( 2 Samuel 21:12 2 Samuel 21:13 ).  </p><p> Here, "at the great stone," Amasa was put to death by Joab ( 2 Samuel 20:5-10 ). To the altar of burnt-offering which was at Gibeon, Joab ( 1 Kings 2:28-34 ), who had taken the side of Adonijah, fled for sanctuary in the beginning of Solomon's reign, and was there also slain by the hand of Benaiah.  </p><p> Soon after he came to the throne, Solomon paid a visit of state to Gibeon, there to offer sacrifices ( 1 Kings 3:4 ;  2 Chr.  1:3 ). On this occasion the Lord appeared to him in a memorable dream, recorded in  1 Kings 3:5-15 ;  2 Chr  1:7-12 . When the temple was built "all the men of Israel assembled themselves" to king Solomon, and brought up from Gibeon the tabernacle and "all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle" to Jerusalem, where they remained till they were carried away by Nebuchadnezzar ( 2 Kings 24:13 ).  </p>
Gideon	<p>called also Jerubbaal ( Judges 6:29 Judges 6:32 ), was the first of the judges whose history is circumstantially narrated (Judg. 6-8). His calling is the commencement of the second period in the history of the judges. After the victory gained by Deborah and Barak over Jabin, Israel once more sank into idolatry, and the Midianites (q.v.) and Amalekites, with other "children of the east," crossed the Jordan each year for seven successive years for the purpose of plundering and desolating the land. Gideon received a direct call from God to undertake the task of delivering the land from these warlike invaders. He was of the family of Abiezer ( Joshua 17:2 ;  1 Chronicles 7:18 ), and of the little township of Ophrah ( Judges 6:11 ). First, with ten of his servants, he overthrew the altars of Baal and cut down the asherah which was upon it, and then blew the trumpet of alarm, and the people flocked to his standard on the crest of Mount Gilboa to the number of twenty-two thousand men. These were, however, reduced to only three hundred. These, strangely armed with torches and pitchers and trumpets, rushed in from three different points on the camp of Midian at midnight, in the valley to the north of Moreh, with the terrible war-cry, "For the Lord and for Gideon" ( Judges 7:18 , RSV). Terror-stricken, the Midianites were put into dire confusion, and in the darkness slew one another, so that only fifteen thousand out of the great army of one hundred and twenty thousand escaped alive. The memory of this great deliverance impressed itself deeply on the mind of the nation ( 1 Samuel 12:11 ;  Psalms 83:11 ;  Isaiah 9:4 ;  10:26 ;  Hebrews 11:32 ). The land had now rest for forty years. Gideon died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of his fathers. Soon after his death a change came over the people. They again forgot Jehovah, and turned to the worship of Baalim, "neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal" (Judg.  8:35 ). Gideon left behind him seventy sons, a feeble, sadly degenerated race, with one exception, that of Abimelech, who seems to have had much of the courage and energy of his father, yet of restless and unscrupulous ambition. He gathered around him a band who slaughtered all Gideon's sons, except Jotham, upon one stone. (See OPHRAH .) </p>
Habakkuk	<p>embrace, the eighth of the twelve minor prophets. Of his personal history we have no reliable information. He was probably a member of the Levitical choir. He was contemporary with Jeremiah and Zephaniah. </p>
Habakkuk, Prophecies of	<p>were probably written about B.C. 650-627, or, as some think, a few years later. This book consists of three chapters, the contents of which are thus comprehensively described: "When the prophet in spirit saw the formidable power of the Chaldeans approaching and menacing his land, and saw the great evils they would cause in Judea, he bore his complaints and doubts before Jehovah, the just and the pure ( 1:2-17 ). And on this occasion the future punishment of the Chaldeans was revealed to him (2). In the third chapter a presentiment of the destruction of his country, in the inspired heart of the prophet, contends with his hope that the enemy would be chastised." The third chapter is a sublime song dedicated "to the chief musician," and therefore intended apparently to be used in the worship of God. It is "unequalled in majesty and splendour of language and imagery."  </p><p> The passage in  2:4 , "The just shall live by his faith," is quoted by the apostle in  Romans 1:17 . (Compare  Galatians 3:12 ;  Hebrews 10:37 Hebrews 10:38 .)  </p>
Habergeon	<p>an Old English word for breastplate. In  Job 41:26  (Heb. shiryah) it is properly a "coat of mail;" the Revised Version has "pointed shaft." In  Exodus 28:32 Exodus 39:23 , it denotes a military garment strongly and thickly woven and covered with mail round the neck and breast. Such linen corselets have been found in Egypt. The word used in these verses is <i> tahra</i> , which is of Egyptian origin. The Revised Version, however, renders it by "coat of mail." (See ARMOUR .) </p>
Habitation	<p>God is the habitation of his people, who find rest and safety in him ( Psalms 71:3 ;  91:9 ). Justice and judgment are the habitation of God's throne ( Psalms 89:14 , Heb. mekhon, "foundation"), because all his acts are founded on justice and judgment. (See   Psalms 132:5 Psalms 132:13 ;  Ephesians 2:22 , of Canaan, Jerusalem, and the temple as God's habitation.) God inhabits eternity ( Isaiah 57:15 ), i.e., dwells not only among men, but in eternity, where time is unknown; and "the praises of Israel" ( Psalms 22:3 ), i.e., he dwells among those praises and is continually surrounded by them.  </p>
Habor	<p>the united stream, or, according to others, with beautiful banks, the name of a river in Assyria, and also of the district through which it flowed ( 1 Chronicles 5:26 ). There is a river called Khabur which rises in the central highlands of Kurdistan, and flows south-west till it falls into the Tigris, about 70 miles above Mosul. This was not, however, the Habor of Scripture.  </p><p> There is another river of the same name (the Chaboras) which, after a course of about 200 miles, flows into the Euphrates at Karkesia, the ancient Circesium. This was, there can be little doubt, the ancient Habor.  </p>
Hachilah	<p>the darksome hill, one of the peaks of the long ridge of el-Kolah, running out of the Ziph plateau, "on the south of Jeshimon" (i.e., of the "waste"), the district to which one looks down from the plateau of Ziph ( 1 Samuel 23:19 ). After his reconciliation with Saul at Engedi ( 24:1-8 ), David returned to Hachilah, where he had fixed his quarters. The Ziphites treacherously informed Saul of this, and he immediately ( 26:1-4 ) renewed his pursuit of David, and "pitched in the hill of Hachilah." David and his nephew Abishai stole at night into the midst of Saul's camp, when they were all asleep, and noiselessly removed the royal spear and the cruse from the side of the king, and then, crossing the intervening valley to the height on the other side, David cried to the people, and thus awoke the sleepers. He then addressed Saul, who recognized his voice, and expostulated with him. Saul professed to be penitent; but David could not put confidence in him, and he now sought refuge at Ziklag. David and Saul never afterwards met. ( 1 Samuel 26:13-25 ).  </p>
Hadad	<p>Adod, brave(?), the name of a Syrian god. </p><li> An Edomite king who defeated the Midianites ( Genesis 36:35 ;  1 Chronicles 1:46 ).  </li><li> Another Edomite king ( 1 Chronicles 1:50 1 Chronicles 1:51 ), called also Hadar ( Genesis 36:39 ;  1 Chronicles 1:51 ).  </li><li> One of "the king's seed in Edom." He fled into Egypt, where he married the sister of Pharaoh's wife ( 1 Kings 11:14-22 ). He became one of Solomon's adversaries.  <p> Hadad, sharp, (a different name in Hebrew from the preceding), one of the sons of Ishmael ( 1 Chronicles 1:30 ). Called also Hadar ( Genesis 25:15 ).  </p> </li>
Hadadezer	<p>Hadad is help; called also Hadarezer, Adod is his help, the king of Zobah. Hanun, the king of the Ammonites, hired among others the army of Hadadezer to assist him in his war against David. Joab, who was sent against this confederate host, found them in double battle array, the Ammonities toward their capital of Rabbah, and the Syrian mercenaries near Medeba. In the battle which was fought the Syrians were scattered, and the Ammonites in alarm fled into their capital. After this Hadadezer went north "to recover his border" ( 2 Samuel 8:3 , A.V.); but rather, as the Revised Version renders, "to recover his dominion", i.e., to recruit his forces. Then followed another battle with the Syrian army thus recruited, which resulted in its being totally routed at Helam ( 2 Samuel 10:17 ). Shobach, the leader of the Syrian army, died on the field of battle. The Syrians of Damascus, who had come to help Hadadezer, were also routed, and Damascus was made tributary to David. All the spoils taken in this war, "shields of gold" and "very much brass," from which afterwards the "brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass" for the temple were made ( 1 Chronicles 18:8 ), were brought to Jerusalem and dedicated to Jehovah. Thus the power of the Ammonites and the Syrians was finally broken, and David's empire extended to the Euphrates ( 2 Samuel 10:15-19 ;  1 Chronicles 19:15-19 ).  </p>
Hadad-rimmon	<p>(composed of the names of two Syrian idols), the name of a place in the valley of Megiddo. It is alluded to by the prophet ( Zechariah 12:11 ) in a proverbial expression derived from the lamentation for Josiah, who was mortally wounded near this place ( 2 Chronicles 35:22-25 ). It has been identified with the modern Rummaneh, a village "at the foot of the Megiddo hills, in a notch or valley about an hour and a half south of Tell Metzellim."  </p>
Hadar	<p>Adod, brave(?). </p><li> A son of Ishmael ( Genesis 25:15 ); in  1 Chronicles 1:30  written Hadad.  </li><li> One of the Edomitish kings ( Genesis 36:39 ) about the time of Saul. Called also Hadad ( 1 Chronicles 1:50 1 Chronicles 1:51 ).  <p> It is probable that in these cases Hadar may be an error simply of transcription for Hadad. </p> </li>
Hadarezer	<p>Adod is his help, the name given to Hadadezer ( 2 Samuel 8:3-12 ) in  2 Samuel 10 .  </p>
Hadashah	<p>new, a city in the valley of Judah ( Joshua 15:37 ).  </p>
Hadassah	<p>myrtle, the Jewish name of Esther (q.v.),  Esther 2:7 .  </p>
Hadattah	<p>new, one of the towns in the extreme south of Judah ( Joshua 15:25 ).  </p>
Hades	<p>that which is out of sight, a Greek word used to denote the state or place of the dead. All the dead alike go into this place. To be buried, to go down to the grave, to descend into hades, are equivalent expressions. In the LXX. this word is the usual rendering of the Hebrew sheol, the common receptacle of the departed ( Genesis 42:38 ;  Psalms 139:8 ;  Hosea 13:14 ;  Isaiah 14:9 ). This term is of comparatively rare occurrence in the Greek New Testament. Our Lord speaks of Capernaum as being "brought down to hell" (hades), i.e., simply to the lowest debasement, ( Matthew 11:23 ). It is contemplated as a kind of kingdom which could never overturn the foundation of Christ's kingdom ( 16:18 ), i.e., Christ's church can never die.  </p><p> In  Luke 16:23  it is most distinctly associated with the doom and misery of the lost.  </p><p> In Acts 2:27-31Peter quotes the LXX. version of  Psalms 16:8-11 , plainly for the purpose of proving our Lord's resurrection from the dead. David was left in the place of the dead, and his body saw corruption. Not so with Christ. According to ancient prophecy ( Psalms 30:3 ) he was recalled to life.  </p>
Hadid	<p>pointed, a place in the tribe of Benjamin near Lydda, or Lod, and Ono ( Ezra 2:33 ;  Nehemiah 7:37 ). It is identified with the modern el-Haditheh, 3 miles east of Lydda.  </p>
Hadlai	<p>resting, an Ephraimite; the father of Amasa, mentioned in  2 Chronicles 28:12 .  </p>
Hadoram	<p>is exalted. </p><li> The son of Tou, king of Hamath, sent by his father to congratulate David on his victory over Hadarezer, king of Syria ( 1 Chronicles 18:10 ; called Joram  2 Samuel 8:10 ).  </li><li> The fifth son of Joktan, the founder of an Arab tribe ( Genesis 10:27 ;  1 Chronicles 1:21 ).  </li><li> One who was "over the tribute;" i.e., "over the levy." He was stoned by the Israelites after they had revolted from Rehoboam ( 2 Chronicles 10:18 ). Called also Adoram ( 2 Samuel 20:24 ) and Adoniram ( 1 Kings 4:6 ).   </li>
Hadrach	<p>the name of a country ( Zechariah 9:1 ) which cannot be identified. Rawlinson would identify it with Edessa. He mentions that in the Assyrian inscriptions it is recorded that "Shalmanezer III. made two expeditions, the first against Damascus B.C. 773, and the second against Hadrach B.C. 772; and again that Asshurdanin-il II. made expeditions against Hadrach in B.C. 765 and 755."  </p>
Haemorrhoids	<p>or Emerods, bleeding piles known to the ancient Romans as mariscae, but more probably malignant boils of an infectious and fatal character. With this loathsome and infectious disease the men of Ashdod were smitten by the hand of the Lord. This calamity they attributed to the presence of the ark in their midst, and therefore they removed it to Gath ( 1 Samuel 5:6-8 ). But the same consequences followed from its presence in Gath, and therefore they had it removed to Ekron, 11 miles distant. The Ekronites were afflicted with the same dreadful malady, but more severely; and a panic seizing the people, they demanded that the ark should be sent back to the land of Israel (9-12;  6:1-9 ).  </p>
Haft	<p>a handle as of a dagger ( Judges 3:22 ).  </p>
Hagar	<p>flight, or, according to others, stranger, an Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid ( Genesis 16:1 ;  Genesis 21:9 Genesis 21:10 ), whom she gave to Abraham (q.v.) as a secondary wife ( 16:2 ). When she was about to become a mother she fled from the cruelty of her mistress, intending apparently to return to her relatives in Egypt, through the desert of Shur, which lay between. Wearied and worn she had reached the place she distinguished by the name of Beer-lahai-roi ("the well of the visible God"), where the angel of the Lord appeared to her. In obedience to the heavenly visitor she returned to the tent of Abraham, where her son Ishmael was born, and where she remained (16) till after the birth of Isaac, the space of fourteen years. Sarah after this began to vent her dissatisfaction both on Hagar and her child. Ishmael's conduct was insulting to Sarah, and she insisted that he and his mother should be dismissed. This was accordingly done, although with reluctance on the part of Abraham ( Genesis 21:14 ). They wandered out into the wilderness, where Ishmael, exhausted with his journey and faint from thirst, seemed about to die. Hagar "lifted up her voice and wept," and the angel of the Lord, as before, appeared unto her, and she was comforted and delivered out of her distresses ( Genesis 21:18 Genesis 21:19 ).  </p><p> Ishmael afterwards established himself in the wilderness of Paran, where he married an Egyptian ( Genesis 21:20 Genesis 21:21 ).  </p><p> "Hagar" allegorically represents the Jewish church ( Galatians 4:24 ), in bondage to the ceremonial law; while "Sarah" represents the Christian church, which is free.  </p>
Hagarene	<p>or Hagarite. </p><li> One of David's mighty men ( 1 Chronicles 11:38 ), the son of a foreigner.  </li><li> Used of Jaziz ( 1 Chronicles 27:31 ), who was over David's flocks. "A Hagarite had charge of David's flocks, and an Ishmaelite of his herds, because the animals were pastured in districts where these nomadic people were accustomed to feed their cattle."  </li><li> In the reign of Saul a great war was waged between the trans-Jordanic tribes and the Hagarites ( 1 Chronicles 5 ), who were overcome in battle. A great booty was captured by the two tribes and a half, and they took possession of the land of the Hagarites.  <p> Subsequently the "Hagarenes," still residing in the land on the east of Jordan, entered into a conspiracy against Israel (Compare  Psalms 83:6 ). They are distinguished from the Ishmaelites.  </p> </li>
Haggai	<p>festive, one of the twelve so-called minor prophets. He was the first of the three (Zechariah, his contemporary, and Malachi, who was about one hundred years later, being the other two) whose ministry belonged to the period of Jewish history which began after the return from captivity in Babylon. Scarcely anything is known of his personal history. He may have been one of the captives taken to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar. He began his ministry about sixteen years after the Return. The work of rebuilding the temple had been put a stop to through the intrigues of the Samaritans. After having been suspended for fifteen years, the work was resumed through the efforts of Haggai and Zechariah ( Ezra 6:14 ), who by their exhortations roused the people from their lethargy, and induced them to take advantage of the favourable opportunity that had arisen in a change in the policy of the Persian government. (See DARIUS [2].) Haggai's prophecies have thus been characterized:, "There is a ponderous and simple dignity in the emphatic reiteration addressed alike to every class of the community, prince, priest, and people, 'Be strong, be strong, be strong' ( 2:4 ). 'Cleave, stick fast, to the work you have to do;' or again, 'Consider your ways, consider, consider, consider' ( Ezra 1:5 Ezra 1:7 Ezra 2:15  Ezra 18 ). It is the Hebrew phrase for the endeavour, characteristic of the gifted seers of all times, to compel their hearers to turn the inside of their hearts outwards to their own view, to take the mask from off their consciences, to 'see life steadily, and to see it wholly.'", Stanley's Jewish Church. (SeeSIGNET .) </p>
Haggai, Book of	<p>consists of two brief, comprehensive chapters. The object of the prophet was generally to urge the people to proceed with the rebuilding of the temple. </p><p> Chapter first comprehends the first address (2-11) and its effects (12-15). Chapter second contains,  </p><li> The second prophecy (1-9), which was delivered a month after the first.  </li><li> The third prophecy (10-19), delivered two months and three days after the second; and  </li><li> The fourth prophecy (20-23), delivered on the same day as the third.  <p> These discourses are referred to in  Ezra 5:1 ;  6:14 ;  Hebrews 12:26 . (Compare  Haggai 2:7 Haggai 2:8 Haggai 2:22 .)  </p> </li>
Haggith	<p>festive; the dancer, a wife of David and the mother of Adonijah ( 2 Samuel 3:4 ;  1 Kings 1:5 1 Kings 1:11 ;  2:13 ;  1 Chronicles 3:2 ), who, like Absalom, was famed for his beauty.  </p>
Hagiographa	<p>the holy writings, a term which came early into use in the Christian church to denote the third division of the Old Testament scriptures, called by the Jews Kethubim, i.e., "Writings." It consisted of five books, viz., Job, Proverbs, and Psalms, and the two books of Chronicles. The ancient Jews classified their sacred books as the Law, the Prophets, and the Kethubim, or Writings. (See BIBLE .) </p><p> In the New Testament ( Luke 24:44 ) we find three corresponding divisions, viz., the Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms.  </p>
Hail	<p>frozen rain-drops; one of the plagues of Egypt ( Exodus 9:23 ). It is mentioned by Haggai as a divine judgment ( Haggai 2:17 ). A hail-storm destroyed the army of the Amorites when they fought against Joshua ( Joshua 10:11 ). Ezekiel represents the wall daubed with untempered mortar as destroyed by great hail-stones (Ezek.  13:11 ). (See also  <span class="badLink">38:22</span> ;  Revelation 8:7 ;  11:19 ;  16:21 .)  </p>
Hail!	<p>a salutation expressive of a wish for the welfare of the person addressed; the translation of the Greek <i> Chaire</i> , "Rejoice" ( Luke 1:8 ). Used in mockery in  Matthew 27:29 .  </p>
Hair	<p></p><li> The Egyptians let the hair of their head and beard grow only when they were in mourning, shaving it off at other times. "So particular were they on this point that to have neglected it was a subject of reproach and ridicule; and whenever they intended to convey the idea of a man of low condition, or a slovenly person, the artists represented him with a beard." Joseph shaved himself before going in to Pharoah ( Genesis 41:14 ). The women of Egypt wore their hair long and plaited. Wigs were worn by priests and laymen to cover the shaven skull, and false beards were common. The great masses of hair seen in the portraits and statues of kings and priests are thus altogether artificial.  </li><li> A precisely opposite practice, as regards men, prevailed among the Assyrians. In Assyrian sculptures the hair always appears long, and combed closely down upon the head. The beard also was allowed to grow to its full length.  </li><li> Among the Greeks the custom in this respect varied at different times, as it did also among the Romans. In the time of the apostle, among the Greeks the men wore short hair, while that of the women was long ( 1 Corinthians 11:14 1 Corinthians 11:15 ). Paul reproves the Corinthians for falling in with a style of manners which so far confounded the distinction of the sexes and was hurtful to good morals. (See , however,  1 Timothy 2:9 , and  1 Peter 3:3 , as regards women.)  </li><li> Among the Hebrews the natural distinction between the sexes was preserved by the women wearing long hair ( Luke 7:38 ;  John 11:2 ;  1 Corinthians 11:6 ), while the men preserved theirs as a rule at a moderate length by frequent clipping.  <p> Baldness disqualified any one for the priest's office ( Leviticus 21 ).  </p><p> Elijah is called a "hairy man" ( 2 Kings 1:8 ) from his flowing locks, or more probably from the shaggy cloak of hair which he wore. His raiment was of camel's hair.  </p><p> Long hair is especially noticed in the description of Absalom's person ( 2 Samuel 14:26 ); but the wearing of long hair was unusual, and was only practised as an act of religious observance by Nazarites ( Numbers 6:5 ;  Judges 13:5 ) and others in token of special mercies ( Acts 18:18 ).  </p><p> In times of affliction the hair was cut off ( Isaiah 3:17 Isaiah 3:24 ;  15:2 ;  22:12 ;  Jeremiah 7:29 ;  Amos 8:10 ). Tearing the hair and letting it go dishevelled were also tokens of grief ( Ezra 9:3 ). "Cutting off the hair" is a figure of the entire destruction of a people ( Isaiah 7:20 ). The Hebrews anointed the hair profusely with fragrant ointments ( Ruth 3:3 ;  2 Sam  14:2 ;  Psalms 23:5 ;  45:7 , etc.), especially in seasons of rejoicing ( Matthew 6:17 ;  Luke 7:46 ).  </p> </li>
Hakkoz	<p>the thorn, the head of one of the courses of the priests ( 1 Chronicles 24:10 ).  </p>
Halah	<p>a district of Media to which captive Israelites were transported by the Assyrian kings ( 2 Kings 17:6 ;  18:11 ;  1 Chronicles 5:26 ). It lay along the banks of the upper Khabur, from its source to its junction with the Jerujer. Probably the district called by Ptolemy Chalcitis.  </p>
Halak	<p>smooth; bald, a hill at the southern extremity of Canaan ( Joshua 11:17 ). It is referred to as if it were a landmark in that direction, being prominent and conspicuous from a distance. It has by some been identified with the modern Jebel el-Madura, on the south frontier of Judah, between the south end of the Dead Sea and the Wady Gaian.  </p>
Halhul	<p>full of hollows, a town in the highlands of Judah ( Joshua 15:58 ). It is now a small village of the same name, and is situated about 5 miles north-east of Hebron on the way to Jerusalem. There is an old Jewish tradition that Gad, David's seer ( 2 Samuel 24:11 ), was buried here.  </p>
Hall	<p>(Gr. aule,  Luke 22:55 ; RSV, "court"), the open court or quadrangle belonging to the high priest's house. In  Matthew 26:69  and  Mark 14:66  this word is incorrectly rendered "palace" in the Authorized Version, but correctly "court" in the Revised Version. In  John 10:1 John 10:16  it means a "sheep-fold." In  Matthew 27:27  and  Mark 15:16  (A.V., "common hall;" RSV, "palace") it refers to the proetorium or residence of the Roman governor at Jerusalem. The "porch" in  Matthew 26:71  is the entrance-hall or passage leading into the central court, which is open to the sky.  </p>
Hallel	<p>praise, the name given to the group of  <span class="badLink">Psalms 113118</span> -118, which are preeminently psalms of praise. It is called "The Egyptian Hallel," because it was chanted in the temple whilst the Passover lambs were being slain. It was chanted also on other festival occasions, as at Pentecost, the feast of Tabernacles, and the feast of Dedication. The Levites, standing before the altar, chanted it verse by verse, the people responding by repeating the verses or by intoned hallelujahs. It was also chanted in private families at the feast of Passover. This was probably the hymn which our Saviour and his disciples sung at the conclusion of the Passover supper kept by them in the upper room at Jerusalem ( Matthew 26:30 ;  Mark 14:26 ).  </p><p> There is also another group called "The Great Hallel," comprehending  Psalms 118136 -136, which was recited on the first evening at the Passover supper and on occasions of great joy.  </p>
Hallelujah	<p>praise ye Jehovah, frequently rendered "Praise ye the LORD," stands at the beginning of ten of the psalms (106,111-113,135,146-150), hence called "hallelujah psalms." From its frequent occurrence it grew into a formula of praise. The Greek form of the word (alleluia) is found in  Revelation 19:1 Revelation 19:3 Revelation 19:4 Revelation 19:6 .  </p>
Hallow	<p>to render sacred, to consecrate ( Exodus 28:38 ;  29:1 ). This word is from the Saxon, and properly means "to make holy." The name of God is "hallowed", i.e., is reverenced as holy ( Matthew 6:9 ).  </p>
Halt	<p>lame on the feet ( Genesis 32:31 ;  Psalms 38:17 ). To "halt between two opinions" ( 1 Kings 18:21 ) is supposed by some to be an expression used in "allusion to birds, which hop from spray to spray, forwards and backwards." The LXX. render the expression "How long go ye lame on both knees?" The Hebrew verb rendered "halt" is used of the irregular dance ("leaped upon") around the altar (ver. 26). It indicates a lame, uncertain gait, going now in one direction, now in another, in the frenzy of wild leaping.  </p>
Ham	<p>warm, hot, and hence the south; also an Egyptian word meaning "black", the youngest son of Noah ( Genesis 5:32 ; comp  Genesis 9:22 Genesis 9:24 ). The curse pronounced by Noah against Ham, properly against Canaan his fourth son, was accomplished when the Jews subsequently exterminated the Canaanites.  </p><p> One of the most important facts recorded in  Genesis 10  is the foundation of the earliest monarchy in Babylonia by Nimrod the grandson of Ham (6,8,10). The primitive Babylonian empire was thus Hamitic, and of a cognate race with the primitive inhabitants of Arabia and of Ethiopia. (See ACCAD .) </p><p> The race of Ham were the most energetic of all the descendants of Noah in the early times of the post-diluvian world. </p>
Haman	<p>(of Persian origin), magnificent, the name of the vizier (i.e., the prime minister) of the Persian king Ahasuerus ( Esther 3:1 , etc.). He is called an "Agagite," which seems to denote that he was descended from the royal family of the Amalekites, the bitterest enemies of the Jews, as Agag was one of the titles of the Amalekite kings. He or his parents were brought to Persia as captives taken in war. He was hanged on the gallows which he had erected for Mordecai the Jew ( Esther 7:10 ). (See ESTHER .) </p>
Hamath	<p>fortress, the capital of one of the kingdoms of Upper Syria of the same name, on the Orontes, in the valley of Lebanon, at the northern boundary of Palestine ( Numbers 13:21 ;  34:8 ), at the foot of Hermon ( Joshua 13:5 ) towards Damascus ( Zechariah 9:2 ;  Jeremiah 49:23 ). It is called "Hamath the great" in  Amos 6:2 , and "Hamath-zobah" in  2 Chronicles 8:3 .  </p><p> Hamath, now Hamah, had an Aramaean population, but Hittite monuments discovered there show that it must have been at one time occupied by the Hittites. It was among the conquests of the Pharaoh Thothmes III. Its king, Tou or Toi, made alliance with David ( 2 Samuel 8:10 ), and in B.C. 740 Azariah formed a league with it against Assyria. It was, however, conquered by the Assyrians, and its nineteen districts placed under Assyrian governors. In B.C. 720 it revolted under a certain Yahu-bihdi, whose name, compounded with that of the God of Israel (Yahu), perhaps shows that he was of Jewish origin. But the revolt was suppressed, and the people of Hamath were transported to Samaria ( 2 Kings 17:24 2 Kings 17:30 ), where they continued to worship their god Ashima. Hamah is beautifully situated on the Orontes, 32 miles north of Emesa, and 36 south of the ruins of Assamea.  </p><p> The kingdom of Hamath comprehended the great plain lying on both banks of the Orontes from the fountain near Riblah to Assamea on the north, and from Lebanon on the west to the desert on the east. The "entrance of Hamath" ( Numbers 34:8 ), which was the north boundary of Palestine, led from the west between the north end of Lebanon and the Nusairiyeh mountains.  </p>
Hamath-zobah	<p>fortress of Zobah, ( 2 Chronicles 8:3 ) is supposed by some to be a different place from the foregoing; but this is quite uncertain.  </p>
Hammath	<p>warm springs, one of the "fenced cities" of Naphtali ( Joshua 19:35 ). It is identified with the warm baths (the heat of the water ranging from 136 degrees to 144 degrees) still found on the shore a little to the south of Tiberias under the name of Hummam Tabariyeh ("Bath of Tiberias").  </p>
Hammedatha	<p>father of Haman, designated usually "the Agagite" ( Esther 3:1 Esther 3:10 ;  8:5 ).  </p>
Hammelech	<p>the king's, the father of Jerahmeel, mentioned in  Jeremiah 36:26 . Some take this word as a common noun, "the king", and understand that Jerahmeel was Jehoiakim's son. Probably, however, it is to be taken as a proper name.  </p>
Hammer	<p></p><li> Heb. pattish, used by gold-beaters ( Isaiah 41:7 ) and by quarry-men ( Jeremiah 23:29 ). Metaphorically of Babylon ( Jeremiah 50:23 ) or Nebuchadnezzar.  </li><li> Heb. makabah, a stone-cutter's mallet ( 1 Kings 6:7 ), or of any workman ( Judges 4:21 ;  Isaiah 44:12 ).  </li><li> Heb. halmuth, a poetical word for a workman's hammer, found only in  Judges 5:26 , where it denotes the mallet with which the pins of the tent of the nomad are driven into the ground.  </li><li> Heb. mappets, rendered "battle-axe" in  Jeremiah 51:20 . This was properly a "mace," which is thus described by Rawlinson: "The Assyrian mace was a short, thin weapon, and must either have been made of a very tough wood or (and this is more probable) of metal. It had an ornamented head, which was sometimes very beautifully modelled, and generally a strap or string at the lower end by which it could be grasped with greater firmness."   </li>
Hammoleketh	<p>the queen, the daughter of Machir and sister of Gilead ( 1 Chronicles 7:17 1 Chronicles 7:18 ). Abiezer was one of her three children.  </p>
Hammon	<p>warm springs. </p><li> A town in the tribe of Asher, near Zidon ( Joshua 19:28 ), identified with 'Ain Hamul.  </li><li> A Levitical city of Naphtali ( 1 Chronicles 6:76 ).   </li>
Hammoth-dor	<p>warm springs, a Levitical city of Naphtali ( Joshua 21:32 ); probably Hammath in  19:35 .  </p>
Hamon	<p>See BAAL-HAMON. </p>
Hamonah	<p>multitude, a name figuratively assigned to the place in which the slaughter and burial of the forces of Gog were to take place ( Ezekiel 39:16 ).  </p>
Hamon-gog	<p>multitude of Gog, the name of the valley in which the slaughtered forces of Gog are to be buried ( Ezekiel 39:11 Ezekiel 39:15 ), "the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea."  </p>
Hamor	<p>he-ass, a Hivite from whom Jacob purchased the plot of ground in which Joseph was afterwards buried ( Genesis 33:19 ). He is called "Emmor" in  Acts 7:16 . His son Shechem founded the city of that name which Simeon and Levi destroyed because of his crime in the matter of Dinah, Jacob's daughter ( Genesis 34:20 ). Hamor and Shechem were also slain (ver. 26).  </p>
Hamul	<p>spared, one of the sons of Pharez, son of Judah ( 1 Chronicles 2:5 ). His descendants are called Hamulites ( Numbers 26:21 ).  </p>
Hamutal	<p>kinsman of the dew, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah, wife of king Josiah, and mother of king Jehoahaz ( 2 Kings 23:31 ), also of king Zedekiah ( 2 Kings 24:18 ).  </p>
Hanameel	<p>whom God has graciously given, the cousin of Jeremiah, to whom he sold the field he possessed in Anathoth, before the siege of Jerusalem ( Jeremiah 32:6-12 ).  </p>
Hanan	<p>merciful. </p><li> A Benjamite ( 1 Chronicles 8:23 ). </li><li> One of David's heroes ( 1 Chronicles 11:43 ). </li><li> Jeremiah 35:4 . </li><li> A descendant of Saul ( 1 Chronicles 8:38 ). </li><li> One of the Nethinim ( Ezra 2:46 ). </li><li> One of the Levites who assisted Ezra ( Nehemiah 8:7 ). </li><li> One of the chiefs who subscribed the covenant ( Nehemiah 10:22 ).   </li>
Hananeel	<p>God has graciously given, a tower in the wall of Jerusalem ( Nehemiah 3:1 ;  12:39 ). It is mentioned also in  Jeremiah 31:38 ;  Zechariah 14:10 .  </p>
Hanani	<p>God has gratified me, or is gracious. </p><li> One of the sons of Heman ( 1 Chronicles 25:4 1 Chronicles 25:25 ). </li><li> A prophet who was sent to rebuke king Asa for entering into a league with Benhadad I., king of Syria, against Judah ( 2 Chronicles 16:1-10 ). He was probably the father of the prophet Jehu ( 1 Kings 16:7 ). </li><li> Probably a brother of Nehemiah ( Nehemiah 1:2 ;  7:2 ), who reported to him the melancholy condition of Jerusalem. Nehemiah afterwards appointed him to have charge of the city gates.   </li>
Hananiah	<p>Jehovah has given. </p><li> A chief of the tribe of Benjamin ( 1 Chronicles 8:24 ). </li><li> One of the sons of Heman ( 1 Chronicles 25:4 1 Chronicles 25:23 ). </li><li> One of Uzziah's military officers ( 2 Chronicles 26:11 ). </li><li> Grandfather of the captain who arrested Jeremiah ( Jeremiah 37:13 ). </li><li> Jeremiah 36:12 . </li><li> Nehemiah 10:23 . </li><li> Shadrach, one of the "three Hebrew children" (Dan. 1;  6:7 ). </li><li> Son of Zerubbabel ( 1 Chronicles 3:19 1 Chronicles 3:21 ). </li><li> Ezra 10:28 . </li><li> The "ruler of the palace; he was a faithful man, and feared God above many" ( Nehemiah 7:2 ). </li><li> Nehemiah 3:8 . </li><li> Nehemiah 3:30 </li><li> A priest, son of Jeremiah ( Nehemiah 12:12 ). </li><li> A false prophet contemporary with ( Jeremiah 28:3 Jeremiah 28:17 ).   </li>
Hand	<p>Called by Galen "the instrument of instruments." It is the symbol of human action ( Psalms 9:16 ;  Job 9:30 ;  Isaiah 1:15 ;  1 Timothy 2:8 ). Washing the hands was a symbol of innocence ( Psalms 26:6 ;  73:13 ;  Matthew 27:24 ), also of sanctification ( 1 Corinthians 6:11 ;  Isaiah 51:16 ;  Psalms 24:3 Psalms 24:4 ). In  Psalms 77:2  the correct rendering is, as in the Revised Version, "My hand was stretched out," etc., instead of, as in the Authorized Version, "My sore ran in the night," etc.  </p><p> The right hand denoted the south, and the left the north ( Job 23:9 ;  1 Samuel 23:19 ). To give the right hand was a pledge of fidelity ( 2 Kings 10:15 ;  Ezra 10:19 ); also of submission to the victors ( Ezekiel 17:18 ;  Jeremiah 50:15 ). The right hand was lifted up in taking an oath ( Genesis 14:22 , etc.). The hand is frequently mentioned, particularly the right hand, as a symbol of power and strength ( Psalms 60:5 ;  Isaiah 28:2 ). To kiss the hand is an act of homage ( 1 Kings 19:18 ;  Job 31:27 ), and to pour water on one's hands is to serve him ( 2 Kings 3:11 ). The hand of God is the symbol of his power: its being upon one denotes favour ( Ezra 7:6 Ezra 7:28 ;  Isaiah 1:25 ;  Luke 1:66 , etc.) or punishment ( Exodus 9:3 ;  Judges 2:15 ;  Acts 13:11 , etc.). A position at the right hand was regarded as the chief place of honour and power ( Psalms 45:9 ;  80:17 ;  110:1 ;  Matthew 26:64 ).  </p>
Handbreadth	<p>a measure of four fingers, equal to about four inches ( Exodus 25:25 ;  37:12 ;  Psalms 39:5 , etc.).  </p>
Handkerchief	<p>Only once in Authorized Version ( Acts 19:12 ). The Greek word (sudarion) so rendered means properly "a sweat-cloth." It is rendered "napkin" in  John 11:44 ;  20:7 ;  Luke 19:20 .  </p>
Handmaid	<p>servant ( Genesis 16:1 ;  Ruth 3:9 ;  Luke 1:48 ). It is probable that Hagar was Sarah's personal attendant while she was in the house of Pharaoh, and was among those maid-servants whom Abram had brought from Egypt.  </p>
Handwriting	<p>( Colossians 2:14 ). The "blotting out the handwriting" is the removal by the grace of the gospel of the condemnation of the law which we had broken.  </p>
Hanes	<p>a place in Egypt mentioned only in  Isaiah 30:4  in connection with a reproof given to the Jews for trusting in Egypt. It was considered the same as Tahpanhes, a fortified town on the eastern frontier, but has been also identified as Ahnas-el-Medeeneh, 70 miles from Cairo.  </p>
Hanging	<p>(as a punishment), a mark of infamy inflicted on the dead bodies of criminals ( Deuteronomy 21:23 ) rather than our modern mode of punishment. Criminals were first strangled and then hanged ( Numbers 25:4 ;  Deuteronomy 21:22 ). (See   2 Samuel 21:6  for the practice of the Gibeonites.)  </p><p> Hanging (as a curtain). </p><li> Heb. masak, (a) before the entrance to the court of the tabernacle ( Exodus 35:17 ); (b) before the door of the tabernacle ( Exodus 26:36 Exodus 26:37 ); (c) before the entrance to the most holy place, called "the veil of the covering" ( 35:12 ;  39:34 ), as the word properly means.  </li><li> Heb. kelaim, tapestry covering the walls of the tabernacle ( Exodus 27:9 ;  35:17 ;  Numbers 3:26 ) to the half of the height of the wall ( Exodus 27:18 ; comp  26:16 ). These hangings were fastened to pillars.  </li><li> Heb. bottim ( 2 Kings 23:7 ), "hangings for the grove" (RSV, "for the Asherah"); marg., instead of "hangings," has "tents" or "houses." Such curtained structures for idolatrous worship are also alluded to in  Ezekiel 16:16 .   </li>
Hannah	<p>favour, grace, one of the wives of Elkanah the Levite, and the mother of Samuel (1Sam. 1; 2). Her home was at Ramathaim-zophim, whence she was wont every year to go to Shiloh, where the tabernacle had been pitched by Joshua, to attend the offering of sacrifices there according to the law ( Exodus 23:15 ;  34:18 ;  Deuteronomy 16:16 ), probably at the feast of the Passover (Compare  Exodus 13:10 ). On occasion of one of these "yearly" visits, being grieved by reason of Peninnah's conduct toward her, she went forth alone, and kneeling before the Lord at the sanctuary she prayed inaudibly. Eli the high priest, who sat at the entrance to the holy place, observed her, and misunderstanding her character he harshly condemned her conduct ( 1 Samuel 1:14-16 ). After hearing her explanation he retracted his injurious charge and said to her, "Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition." Perhaps the story of the wife of Manoah was not unknown to her. Thereafter Elkanah and his family retired to their quiet home, and there, before another Passover, Hannah gave birth to a son, whom, in grateful memory of the Lord's goodness, she called Samuel, i.e., "heard of God." After the child was weaned (probably in his third year) she brought him to Shiloh into the house of the Lord, and said to Eli the aged priest, "Oh my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the Lord. For this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him: therefore I also have granted him to the Lord; as long as he liveth he is granted to the Lord" ( 1 Samuel 1:27 1 Samuel 1:28 , RSV). Her gladness of heart then found vent in that remarkable prophetic ( 1 Samuel 2:1-10 ; Compare  Luke 1:46-55 ) which contains the first designation of the Messiah under that name ( 1 Samuel 2:10 , "Annointed" = "Messiah"). And so Samuel and his parents parted. He was left at Shiloh to minister "before the Lord." And each year, when they came up to Shiloh, Hannah brought to her absent child "a little coat" (Heb. meil, a term used to denote the "robe" of the ephod worn by the high priest,  Exodus 28:31 ), a priestly robe, a long upper tunic ( 1 Chronicles 15:27 ), in which to minister in the tabernacle ( 1 Samuel 2:19 ;  15:27 ;  Job 2:12 ). "And the child Samuel grew before the Lord." After Samuel, Hannah had three sons and two daughters.  </p>
Hanniel	<p>grace of God. </p><li> A chief of the tribe of Manasseh ( Numbers 34:23 ). </li><li> A chief of the tribe of Asher ( 1 Chronicles 7:39 ).   </li>
Hanun	<p>graciously given. </p><li> The son and successor of Nahash, king of Moab. David's messengers, sent on an embassy of condolence to him to Rabbah Ammon, his capital, were so grossly insulted that he proclaimed war against Hanun. David's army, under the command of Joab, forthwith crossed the Jordan, and gained a complete victory over the Moabites and their allies ( 2 Samuel 10:1-14 ) at Medeba (q.v.).  </li><li> Nehemiah 3:13 . </li><li> 3:30 .   </li>
Hara	<p>mountainous land, a province of Assyria ( 1 Chronicles 5:26 ), between the Tigris and the Euphrates, along the banks of the Khabur, to which some of the Israelite captives were carried. It has not been identified. Some think the word a variation of Haran.  </p>
Haradah	<p>fright; fear, the twenty-fifth station of the Israelites in their wanderings ( Numbers 33:24 ).  </p>
Haran	<p></p><li> Heb. haran; i.e., "mountaineer." The eldest son of Terah, brother of Abraham and Nahor, and father of Lot, Milcah, and Iscah. He died before his father ( Genesis 11:27 ), in Ur of the Chaldees.  </li><li> Heb. haran, i.e., "parched;" or probably from the Accadian charana, meaning "a road." A celebrated city of Western Asia, now Harran, where Abram remained, after he left Ur of the Chaldees, till his father Terah died ( Genesis 11:31 Genesis 11:32 ), when he continued his journey into the land of Canaan. It is called "Charran" in the LXX. and in  Acts 7:2 . It is called the "city of Nahor" ( Genesis 24:10 ), and Jacob resided here with Laban ( 30:43 ). It stood on the river Belik, an affluent of the Euphrates, about 70 miles above where it joins that river in Upper Mesopotamia or Padan-aram, and about 600 miles northwest of Ur in a direct line. It was on the caravan route between the east and west. It is afterwards mentioned among the towns taken by the king of Assyria ( 2 Kings 19:12 ;  Isaiah 37:12 ). It was known to the Greeks and Romans under the name Carrhae.  </li><li> The son of Caleb of Judah ( 1 Chronicles 2:46 ) by his concubine Ephah.   </li>
Harbona	<p>(a Persian word meaning "ass-driver"), one of the seven eunuchs or chamberlains of king Ahasuerus ( Esther 1:10 ;  7:9 ).  </p>
Hare	<p>(Heb. 'arnebeth) was prohibited as food according to the Mosaic law ( Leviticus 11:6 ;  Deuteronomy 14:7 ), "because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof." The habit of this animal is to grind its teeth and move its jaw as if it actually chewed the cud. But, like the cony (q.v.), it is not a ruminant with four stomachs, but a rodent like the squirrel, rat, etc. Moses speaks of it according to appearance. It is interdicted because, though apparently chewing the cud, it did not divide the hoof.  </p><p> There are two species in Syria, (1) the Lepus Syriacus or Syrian hare, which is like the English hare; and (2) the Lepus Sinaiticus, or hare of the desert. No rabbits are found in Syria.  </p>
Hareth	<p>thicket, a wood in the mountains of Judah where David hid when pursued by Saul ( 1 Samuel 22:5 ). It was possibly while he was here that the memorable incident narrated in 2Sam  2 Samuel 11:16-19  occurred. This place has not been identified, but perhaps it may be the modern Kharas, on the borders of the chain of mountains some 3 miles east of Keilah.  </p>
Harhaiah	<p>zeal of Jehovah, ( Nehemiah 3:8 ) "of the goldsmiths," one whose son helped to repair the wall of Jerusalem.  </p>
Harhur	<p>fever, one of the Nethinim ( Ezra 2:51 ).  </p>
Harim	<p>flat-nosed. </p><li> The head of the second course of priests ( 1 Chronicles 24:8 ). </li><li> Ezra 2:32 Ezra 2:39 ;  Nehemiah 7:35 Nehemiah 7:42 . </li><li> Nehemiah 3:11 . </li><li> 12:3 . </li><li> 10:5  </li>
Hariph	<p>autumnal rain. </p><li> Nehemiah 7:24 . </li><li> 10:19 .   </li>
Harlot	<p></p><li> Heb. zonah ( Genesis 34:31 ;  38:15 ). In verses 21,22the Hebrew word used in <i> kedeshah</i> , i.e., a woman consecrated or devoted to prostitution in connection with the abominable worship of Asherah or Astarte, the Syrian Venus. This word is also used in  Deuteronomy 23:17 ;  Hosea 4:14 . Thus Tamar sat by the wayside as a consecrated kedeshah.  <p> It has been attempted to show that Rahab, usually called a "harlot" ( Joshua 2:1 ;  6:17 ;  Hebrews 11:31 ;  James 2:25 ), was only an innkeeper. This interpretation, however, cannot be maintained.  </p><p> Jephthah's mother is called a "strange woman" ( Judges 11:2 ). This, however, merely denotes that she was of foreign extraction.  </p><p> In the time of Solomon harlots appeared openly in the streets, and he solemnly warns against association with them ( Proverbs 7:12 ;  9:14 . See also  Jeremiah 3:2 ;  Ezekiel 16:24 Ezekiel 16:25 Ezekiel 16:31 ). The Revised Version, following the LXX., has "and the harlots washed," etc., instead of the rendering of the Authorized Version, "now they washed," of  1 Kings 22:38 .  </p><p> To commit fornication is metaphorically used for to practice idolatry ( Jeremiah 3:1 ;  Ezekiel 16:15 ; Hos. throughout); hence Jerusalem is spoken of as a harlot ( Isaiah 1:21 ).  </p></li><li> Heb. nokriyah, the "strange woman" ( 1 Kings 11:1 ;  Proverbs 5:20 ;  7:5 ;  23:27 ). Those so designated were Canaanites and other Gentiles ( Joshua 23:13 ). To the same class belonged the "foolish", i.e., the sinful, "woman."  <p> In the New Testament the Greek pornai, plural, "harlots," occurs in  Matthew 21:31 Matthew 21:32 , where they are classed with publicans;  Luke 15:30 ;  1 Corinthians 6:15 1 Corinthians 6:16 ;  Hebrews 11:31 ;  James 2:25 . It is used symbolically in  Revelation 17:1 Revelation 17:5 Revelation 17:15 Revelation 17:16 ;  19:2 .  </p> </li>
Harnepher	<p>a chief of the tribe of Asher ( 1 Chronicles 7:36 ).  </p>
Harness	<p></p><li> Heb. 'asar, "to bind;" hence the act of fastening animals to a cart ( 1 Samuel 6:7 1 Samuel 6:10 ;  Jeremiah 46:4 , etc.).  </li><li> An Old English word for "armour;" Heb. neshek ( 2 Chronicles 9:24 ).  </li><li> Heb. shiryan, a coat of mail ( 1 Kings 22:34 ;  2 Chr.  18:33 ; rendered "breastplate" in  Isaiah 59:17 ).  </li><li> The children of Israel passed out of Egypt "harnessed" ( Exodus 13:18 ), i.e., in an orderly manner, and as if to meet a foe. The word so rendered is probably a derivative from Hebrew <i> hamesh</i> (i.e., "five"), and may denote that they went up in five divisions, viz., the van, centre, two wings, and rear-guard.  </li>
Harod	<p>palpitation, a fountain near which Gideon and his army encamped on the morning of the day when they encountered and routed the Midianites (Judg. 7). It was south of the hill Moreh. The present 'Ain Jalud ("Goliath's Fountain"), south of Jezreel and nearly opposite Shunem, is probably the fountain here referred to ( Exodus 7:4 Exodus 7:5 ).  </p>
Harodite	<p>an epithet applied to two of David's heroes ( 2 Samuel 23:25 ). (Compare  1 Chronicles 11:27 .)  </p>
Harosheth of the Gentiles	<p>( Judges 4:2 ) or nations, a city near Hazor in Galilee of the Gentiles, or Upper Galilee, in the north of Palestine. It was here that Jabin's great army was marshalled before it went forth into the great battlefield of Esdraelon to encounter the army of Israel, by which it was routed and put to flight (Judg. 4). It was situated "at the entrance of the pass to Esdraelon from the plain of Acre" at the base of Carmel. The name in the Hebrew is <i> Harosheth ha Gojim</i> , i.e., "the smithy of the nations;" probably, as is supposed, so called because here Jabin's iron war-chariots, armed with scythes, were made. It is identified with el-Harithiyeh. </p>
Harp	<p>(Heb. kinnor), the national instrument of the Hebrews. It was invented by Jubal ( Genesis 4:21 ). Some think the word <i> kinnor</i> denotes the whole class of stringed instruments. It was used as an accompaniment to songs of cheerfulness as well as of praise to God ( Genesis 31:27 ;  1 Samuel 16:23 ;  2 Chr  20:28 ;  Psalms 33:2 ;  137:2 ).  </p><p> In Solomon's time harps were made of almug-trees ( 1 Kings 10:11 1 Kings 10:12 ). In  1 Chronicles 15:21  mention is made of "harps on the Sheminith;" Revised Version, "harps set to the Sheminith;" better perhaps "harps of eight strings." The soothing effect of the music of the harp is referred to  1 Samuel 16:16 1 Samuel 16:23 ;  18:10 ;  19:9 . The church in heaven is represented as celebrating the triumphs of the Redeemer "harping with their harps" ( Revelation 14:2 ).  </p>
Harrow	<p>(Heb. harits), a tribulum or sharp threshing sledge; a frame armed on the under side with rollers or sharp spikes ( 2 Samuel 12:31 ;  1 Chronicles 20:3 ).  </p><p> Heb. verb <i> sadad</i> , to harrow a field, break its clods ( Job 39:10 ;  Isaiah 28:4 ;  Hosea 10: :  11 ). Its form is unknown. It may have resembled the instrument still in use in Egypt.  </p>
Harsha	<p>worker or enchanter, one of the Nethinim ( Ezra 2:52 ;  Nehemiah 7:54 ).  </p>
Hart	<p>(Heb. 'ayal), a stag or male deer. It is ranked among the clean animals ( Deuteronomy 12:15 ;  14:5 ;  15:22 ), and was commonly killed for food ( 1 Kings 4:23 ). The hart is frequently alluded to in the poetical and prophetical books ( Isaiah 35:6 ; Cant  Isaiah 2:8 Isaiah 2:9 ;  Lamentations 1:6 ;  Psalms 42:1 ).  </p>
Harum	<p>elevated, ( 1 Chronicles 4:8 ), a descendant of Judah.  </p>
Haruphite	<p>a native of Hariph; an epithet given to Shephatiah, one of those who joined David at Ziklag ( 1 Chronicles 12:5 ).  </p>
Haruz	<p>eager, the father of Meshullemeth, the wife of king Manasseh ( 2 Kings 21:19 ) and mother of king Amon.  </p>
Harvest	<p>the season for gathering grain or fruit. On the 16th day of Abib (or April) a handful of ripe ears of corn was offered as a first-fruit before the Lord, and immediately after this the harvest commenced ( Leviticus 23:9-14 ;  2 Sam  Leviticus 21:9 Leviticus 21:10 ;  Ruth 2:23 ). It began with the feast of Passover and ended with Pentecost, thus lasting for seven weeks ( Exodus 23:16 ). The harvest was a season of joy ( Psalms 126:1-6 ;  Isaiah 9:3 ). This word is used figuratively  Matthew 9:37 ;  13:30 ;  Luke 10:2 ;  John 4:35 . (See AGRICULTURE .) </p>
Hasadiah	<p>favoured by Jehovah, one of the sons of Pedaiah ( 1 Chronicles 3:20 ), of the royal line of David.  </p>
Hasenuah	<p>bristling or hated, a Benjamite ( 1 Chronicles 9:7 ).  </p>

Hashabniah	<p></p><li> Nehemiah 3:10 . </li><li> One of the Levites whom Ezra appointed to interpret the law to the people ( Nehemiah 9:5 ).   </li>
Hashbadana	<p>consideration in judging, stood at Ezra's left hand when he read the law ( Nehemiah 8:4 ).  </p>
Hashmonah	<p>fatness, the thirtieth halting-place of the Israelites during their wanderings in the wilderness, not far from Mount Hor ( Numbers 33:29 Numbers 33:30 ).  </p>
Hashub	<p>intelligent. </p><li> A Levite of the family of Merari ( Nehemiah 11:15 ;  1 Chronicles 9:14 ). </li><li> Nehemiah 3:23 3:11 .   </li>
Hashubah	<p>ibid., a descendant of David ( 1 Chronicles 3:20 ).  </p>
Hashum	<p>opulent. </p><li> Ezra 2:19 ;  Nehemiah 7:22 . </li><li> Stood on Ezra's left hand while he read the law ( Nehemiah 8:4 ).   </li>
Hasrah	<p>poverty, "keeper of the wardrobe," i.e., of the sacerdotal vestments ( 2 Chronicles 34:22 ); called Harhas  2 Kings 22:14 . He was husband of the prophetess Huldah.  </p>
Hasupha	<p>uncovered, one of the Nethinim ( Ezra 2:43 ;  Nehemiah 7:46 ).  </p>
Hat	<p>Chald. karb'ela, ( Daniel 3:21 ), properly mantle or pallium. The Revised Version renders it "tunic."  </p>
Hatach	<p>verity, one of the eunuchs or chamberlains in the palace of Ahasuerus ( Esther 4:5 Esther 4:6 Esther 4:9 Esther 4:10 ).  </p>

Hatipha	<p>captured, one of the Nethinim ( Ezra 2:54 ).  </p>
Hatita	<p>exploration, one of the temple porters or janitors ( Ezra 2:42 ). He returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel.  </p>
Hatred	<p>among the works of the flesh ( Galatians 5:20 ). Altogether different is the meaning of the word in  Deuteronomy 21:15 ;  Matthew 6:24 ;  Luke 14:26 ;  Romans 9:13 , where it denotes only a less degree of love.  </p>
Hattush	<p>assembled. </p><li> A priest who returned with Zerubbabel ( Nehemiah 12:2 ). </li><li> Ezra 8:2 . </li><li> Nehemiah 3:10 . </li><li> Nehemiah 10:4 . </li><li> 1 Chronicles 3:22 .   </li>
Hauran	<p>cave-land, mentioned only in  Ezekiel 47:16 Ezekiel 47:18 . It was one of the ancient divisions of Bashan (q.v.), and lay on the south-east of Gaulanitis or the Jaulan, and on the south of Lejah, extending from the Arnon to the Hieromax. It was the most fertile region in Syria, and to this day abounds in the ruins of towns, many of which have stone doors and massive walls. It retains its ancient name. It was known by the Greeks and Romans as "Auranitis."  </p>
Haven	<p>a harbour ( Psalms 107:30 ;  Acts 27: :  12 ). The most famous on the coast of Palestine was that of Tyre ( Ezekiel 27:3 ). That of Crete, called "Fair Havens," is mentioned  Acts 27:8 .  </p>
Havilah	<p>the sand region. </p><li> A land mentioned in  Genesis 2:11  rich in gold and bdellium and onyx stone. The question as to the locality of this region has given rise to a great diversity of opinion. It may perhaps be identified with the sandy tract which skirts Babylonia along the whole of its western border, stretching from the lower Euphrates to the mountains of Edom.  </li><li> A district in Arabia-Felix. It is uncertain whether the tribe gave its name to this region or derived its name from it, and whether it was originally a Cushite ( Genesis 10:7 ) or a Joktanite tribe ( 10:29 ; comp  25:18 ), or whether there were both a Cushite and a Joktanite Havilah. It is the opinion of Kalisch, however, that Havilah "in both instances designates the same country, extending at least from the Persian to the Arabian Gulf, and on account of its vast extent easily divided into two distinct parts." This opinion may be well vindicated.  </li><li> One of the sons of Cush ( Genesis 10:7 ).  </li><li> A son of Joktan ( Genesis 10:29 ;  1 Chronicles 1:23 ).   </li>
Havoth-jair	<p>hamlets of the enlightener a district in the east of Jordan. </p><li> Jair, the son of Manasseh, took some villages of Gilead and called them by this name ( Numbers 32:41 ).  </li><li> Again, it is said that Jair "took all the tract of Argob," and called it Bashanhavoth-jair ( Deuteronomy 3:14 ). (See also  Joshua 13:30 ;  1 Kings 4:13 ;  1 Chronicles 2:22 1 Chronicles 2:23 .)   </li>
Hawk	<p>(Heb. netz, a word expressive of strong and rapid flight, and hence appropriate to the hawk). It is an unclean bird ( Leviticus 11:16 ;  Deuteronomy 14:15 ). It is common in Syria and surrounding countries. The Hebrew word includes various species of Falconidae, with special reference perhaps to the kestrel (Falco tinnunculus), the hobby (Hypotriorchis subbuteo), and the lesser kestrel (Tin, Cenchris). The kestrel remains all the year in Palestine, but some ten or twelve other species are all migrants from the south. Of those summer visitors to Palestine special mention may be made of the Falco sacer and the Falco lanarius. (See NIGHT-HAWK.)  </p>
Hay	<p>properly so called, was not in use among the Hebrews; straw was used instead. They cut the grass green as it was needed. The word rendered "hay" in  Proverbs 27:25  means the first shoots of the grass. In  Isaiah 15:6  the Revised Version has correctly "grass," where the Authorized Version has "hay."  </p>
Hazael	<p>whom God beholds, an officer of Ben-hadad II., king of Syria, who ultimately came to the throne, according to the word of the Lord to Elijah ( 1 Kings 19:15 ), after he had put the king to death ( 2 Kings 8:15 ). His interview with Elisha is mentioned in  2 Kings 8 . The Assyrians soon after his accession to the throne came against him and defeated him with very great loss; and three years afterwards again invaded Syria, but on this occasion Hazael submitted to them. He then turned his arms against Israel, and ravaged "all the land of Gilead," etc. ( 2 Kings 10:33 ), which he held in a degree of subjection to him ( 2 Kings 13:3-7 2 Kings 13:22 ). He aimed at the subjugation also of the kingdom of Judah, when Joash obtained peace by giving him "all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the Lord, and in the king's house" ( 2 Kings 12:18 ;  2 Chr  24:24 ). He reigned about forty-six years (B.C.886-840), and was succeeded on the throne by his son Ben-hadad ( 2 Kings 13:22-25 ), who on several occasions was defeated by Jehoash, the king of Israel, and compelled to restore all the land of Israel his father had taken.  </p>
Hazar-addar	<p>village of Addar, a place in the southern boundary of Palestine ( Numbers 34:4 ), in the desert to the west of Kadesh-barnea. It is called Adar in  Joshua 15:3 .  </p>
Hazar-enan	<p>village of fountains, a place on the north-east frontier of Palestine ( Numbers 34:9 Numbers 34:10 ). Some have identified it with Ayan ed-Dara in the heart of the central chain of Anti-Libanus. More probably, however, it has been identified with Kuryetein, about 60 miles east-north-east of Damascus. (Compare  Ezekiel 47:17 ;  48:1 .)  </p>
Hazar-gaddah	<p>village of fortune, a city on the south border of Judah ( Joshua 15:27 ), midway between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea.  </p>
Hazar-hatticon	<p>village of the midway, a place near Hamath in the confines of Hauran ( Ezekiel 47:16 ), probably on the north brow of Hermon.  </p>
Hazar-maveth	<p>court of death, the third son of Joktan, and a region in Arabia-Felix settled by him ( Genesis 10:26 ;  1 Chronicles 1:20 ). It is probably the modern province of Hadramaut, situated on the Indian Ocean east of the modern Yemen.  </p>
Hazar-shual	<p>village or enclosure of the jackal, a city on the south border of Judah ( Joshua 15:28 ;  Nehemiah 11:27 ). It has been identified with the ruins of Saweh, half-way between Beersheba and Moladah.  </p>
Hazar-susah	<p>village of the horse, the same as Sansannah, one of Solomon's "chariot cities" ( Joshua 15:31 ;  2 Chr  1:14 ), a depot in the south border of Judah.  </p>
Hazel	<p>Heb. luz, ( Genesis 30:37 ), a nutbearing tree. The Hebrew word is rendered in the Vulgate by amygdalinus, "the almond-tree," which is probably correct. That tree flourishes in Syria.  </p>
Hazerim	<p>villages, probably the name of the temporary villages in which the nomad Avites resided ( Deuteronomy 2:23 ).  </p>
Hazeroth	<p>fenced enclosures consisting of "a low wall of stones in which thick bundles of thorny acacia are inserted, the tangled branches and long needle-like spikes forming a perfectly impenetrable hedge around the encampment" of tents and cattle which they sheltered. Such like enclosures abound in the wilderness of Paran, which the Israelites entered after leaving Sinai ( Numbers 11:35 ;  12:16 ;  Numbers 33:17 Numbers 33:18 ). This third encampment of the Israelites has been identified with the modern 'Ain el-Hudhera, some 40 miles north-east of Sinai. Here Miriam (q.v.), being displeased that Moses had married a Cushite wife ( Numbers 12:1 ), induced Aaron to join with her in rebelling against Moses. God vindicated the authority of his "servant Moses," and Miriam was smitten with leprosy. Moses interceded for her, and she was healed ( Numbers 12:4-16 ). From this encampment the Israelites marched northward across the plateau of et-Tih, and at length reached KADESH.  </p>
Hazezon-tamar	<p>pruning of the palm, the original name of the place afterwards called ENGEDI (q.v.),  Genesis 14:7 ; called also HAZAZON-TAMAR ( 2 Chronicles 20:2 ).  </p>
Hazo	<p>vision, one of the sons of Nahor ( Genesis 22:22 ).  </p>
Hazor	<p>enclosed; fortified. </p><li> A stronghold of the Canaanites in the mountains north of Lake Merom ( Joshua 11:1-5 ). Jabin the king with his allied tribes here encountered Joshua in a great battle. Joshua gained a signal victory, which virtually completed his conquest of Canaan ( 11:10-13 ). This city was, however, afterwards rebuilt by the Canaanites, and was ruled by a king with the same hereditary name of Jabin. His army, under a noted leader of the name of Sisera, swept down upon the south, aiming at the complete subjugation of the country. This powerful army was met by the Israelites under Barak, who went forth by the advice of the prophetess Deborah. The result was one of the most remarkable victories for Israel recorded in the Old Testament ( Joshua 19:36 ;  Judges 4:2 ;  1 Samuel 12:9 ). The city of Hazor was taken and occupied by the Israelites. It was fortified by Solomon to defend the entrance into the kingdom from Syria and Assyria. When Tiglath-pileser, the Assyrian king, invaded the land, this was one of the first cities he captured, carrying its inhabitants captive into Assyria ( 2 Kings 15:29 ). It has been identified with Khurbet Harrah, 2 1/2 miles south-east of Kedesh.  </li><li> A city in the south of Judah ( Joshua 15:23 ). The name here should probably be connected with the word following, Ithnan, HAZOR-ITHNAN instead of "Hazor and Ithnan."  </li><li> A district in Arabia ( Jeremiah 49:28-33 ), supposed by some to be Jetor, i.e., Ituraea.  </li><li> "Kerioth and Hezron" ( Joshua 15: :  25 ) should be "Kerioth-hezron" (as in the RSV), the two names being joined together as the name of one place (e.g., like Kirjath-jearim), "the same is Hazor" (RSV). This place has been identified with el-Kuryetein, and has been supposed to be the home of Judas Iscariot. (See KERIOTH .)  </li>
Hazor-hadattah	<p>New Hazor, a city in the south of Judah ( Joshua 15:25 ). It is probably identified with the ruins of el-Hazzarah, near Beit Jebrin.  </p>
Head-bands	<p>(Heb. kishshurim), properly girdles or belts for the waist ( Isaiah 3:20 , RSV, "sashes;"  Jeremiah 2:32 , rendered "attire", i.e., a girdle round the waist).  </p>
Head-dress	<p>Not in common use among the Hebrews. It is first mentioned in  Exodus 28:40  (A.V., "bonnets;" RSV, "head-tires"). It was used especially for purposes of ornament ( Job 29:14 ;  Isaiah 3:23 ;  62:3 ). The Hebrew word here used, <i> tsaniph</i> , properly means a turban, folds of linen wound round the head. The Hebrew word <i> peer</i> , used in  Isaiah 61:3 , there rendered "beauty" (A.V.) and "garland" (RSV), is a head-dress or turban worn by females ( Isaiah 3: :  20 , "bonnets"), priests ( Exodus 39:28 ), a bridegroom ( Isaiah 61:10 , "ornament;" RSV, "garland").  Ezekiel 16:10  and  Jonah 2:5  are to be understood of the turban wrapped round the head. The Hebrew <i> shebisim</i> ( Isaiah 3:18 ), in the Authorized Version rendered "cauls," and marg. "networks," denotes probably a kind of netted head-dress. The "horn" (Heb. keren) mentioned in  1 Samuel 2:1  is the head-dress called by the Druses of Mount Lebanon the tantura.  </p>
Heap	<p>When Joshua took the city of Ai ( Joshua 8 ), he burned it and "made it an heap [Heb. tel] for ever" ( 8:28 ). The ruins of this city were for a long time sought for in vain. It has been at length, however, identified with the mound which simply bears the name of "Tel." "There are many Tels in modern Palestine, that land of Tels, each Tel with some other name attached to it to mark the former site. But the site of Ai has no other name 'unto this day.' It is simply et-Tel, 'the heap' par excellence."  </p>
Heart	<p>According to the Bible, the heart is the centre not only of spiritual activity, but of all the operations of human life. "Heart" and "soul" are often used interchangeably ( Deuteronomy 6:5 ;  26:16 ; Compare  Matthew 22:37 ;  Mark 12:30 Mark 12:33 ), but this is not generally the case.  </p><p> The heart is the "home of the personal life," and hence a man is designated, according to his heart, wise ( 1 Kings 3:12 , etc.), pure ( Psalms 24:4 ;  Matthew 5:8 , etc.), upright and righteous ( Genesis 20:5 Genesis 20:6 ;  Psalms 11:2 ;  78:72 ), pious and good ( Luke 8:15 ), etc. In these and such passages the word "soul" could not be substituted for "heart."  </p><p> The heart is also the seat of the conscience ( Romans 2:15 ). It is naturally wicked ( Genesis 8:21 ), and hence it contaminates the whole life and character ( Matthew 12:34 ;  15:18 ; Compare Eccl  8:11 ;  Psalms 73:7 ). Hence the heart must be changed, regenerated (Ezek.  36:26 ;  11:19 ;  Psalms 51:10-14 ), before a man can willingly obey God.  </p><p> The process of salvation begins in the heart by the believing reception of the testimony of God, while the rejection of that testimony hardens the heart ( Psalms 95:8 ;  Proverbs 28:14 ;  2 Chr.  36:13 ). "Hardness of heart evidences itself by light views of sin; partial acknowledgment and confession of it; pride and conceit; ingratitude; unconcern about the word and ordinances of God; inattention to divine providences; stifling convictions of conscience; shunning reproof; presumption, and general ignorance of divine things."  </p>
Hearth	<p>Heb. ah ( Jeremiah 36:22 Jeremiah 36:23 ; RSV, "brazier"), meaning a large pot like a brazier, a portable furnace in which fire was kept in the king's winter apartment.  </p><p> Heb. kiyor ( Zechariah 12:6 ; RSV, "pan"), a fire-pan.  </p><p> Heb. moqed ( Psalms 102:3 ; RSV, "fire-brand"), properly a fagot.  </p><p> Heb. yaqud ( Isaiah 30:14 ), a burning mass on a hearth.  </p>
He-ass	<p>Heb. hamor, ( Genesis 12:16 ), the general designation of the donkey used for carrying burdens ( Genesis 42:26 ) and for ploughing ( Isaiah 30:24 ). It is described in Gen  Genesis 19:26 . (See ASS .) </p>
Heath	<p>Heb. 'arar, ( Jeremiah 17:6 ;  48:6 ), a species of juniper called by the Arabs by the same name ('arar), the Juniperus sabina or savin. "Its gloomy, stunted appearance, with its scale-like leaves pressed close to its gnarled stem, and cropped close by the wild goats, as it clings to the rocks about Petra, gives great force to the contrast suggested by the prophet, between him that trusteth in man, naked and destitute, and the man that trusteth in the Lord, flourishing as a tree planted by the waters" (Tristram, Natural History of the Bible).  </p>
Heathen	<p>(Heb. plural goyum). At first the word <i> goyim</i> denoted generally all the nations of the world ( Genesis 18:18 ; Compare  Galatians 3:8 ). The Jews afterwards became a people distinguished in a marked manner from the other <i> goyim</i> . They were a separate people ( Leviticus 20:23 ;  26:14-45 ;  Deuteronomy 28 ), and the other nations, the Amorites, Hittites, etc., were the <i> goyim</i> , the heathen, with whom the Jews were forbidden to be associated in any way ( Joshua 23:7 ;  1 Kings 11:2 ). The practice of idolatry was the characteristic of these nations, and hence the word came to designate idolaters ( Psalms 106:47 ;  Jeremiah 46:28 ;  Lamentations 1:3 ;  Isaiah 36:18 ), the wicked ( Psalms 9:5 Psalms 9:15 Psalms 9:17 ).  </p><p> The corresponding Greek word in the New Testament, <i> ethne</i> , has similar shades of meaning. In  Acts 22:21 ,  Galatians 3:14 , it denotes the people of the earth generally; and in  Matthew 6:7 , an idolater. In modern usage the word denotes all nations that are strangers to revealed religion.  </p>
Heave offering	<p>Heb. terumah, ( Exodus 29:27 ) means simply an offering, a present, including all the offerings made by the Israelites as a present. This Hebrew word is frequently employed. Some of the rabbis attach to the word the meaning of elevation, and refer it to the heave offering, which consisted in presenting the offering by a motion up and down, distinguished from the wave offering, which consisted in a repeated movement in a horizontal direction, a "wave offering to the Lord as ruler of earth, a heave offering to the Lord as ruler of heaven." The right shoulder, which fell to the priests in presenting thank offerings, was called the heave shoulder ( Leviticus 7:34 ;  Numbers 6:20 ). The first fruits offered in harvest-time ( Numbers 15:20 Numbers 15:21 ) were heave offerings.  </p>
Heaven	<p></p><li> Definitions. The phrase "heaven and earth" is used to indicate the whole universe ( Genesis 1:1 ;  Jeremiah 23:24 ;  Acts 17:24 ). According to the Jewish notion there were three heavens,  <p> (a) The firmament, as "fowls of the heaven" ( Genesis 2:19 ;  Genesis 7:3 Genesis 7:23 ;  Psalms 8:8 , etc.), "the eagles of heaven" ( Lamentations 4:19 ), etc.  </p><p> (b) The starry heavens ( Deuteronomy 17:3 ;  Jeremiah 8:2 ;  Matthew 24:29 ).  </p><p> (c) "The heaven of heavens," or "the third heaven" ( Deuteronomy 10:14 ;  1 Kings 8:27 ;  Psalms 115:16 ;  148:4 ;  2 co  12:2 ).  </p></li><li> Meaning of words in the original,  <p> (a) The usual Hebrew word for "heavens" is <i> shamayim</i> , a plural form meaning "heights," "elevations" ( Genesis 1:1 ;  2:1 ).  </p><p> (b) The Hebrew word <i> marom</i> is also used ( Psalms 68:18 ;  93:4 ;  102:19 , etc.) as equivalent to <i> shamayim</i> , "high places," "heights." </p><p> (c) Heb. galgal, literally a "wheel," is rendered "heaven" in  Psalms 77:18  (RSV, "whirlwind").  </p><p> (d) Heb. shahak, rendered "sky" ( Deuteronomy 33:26 ;  Job 37:18 ;  Psalms 18:11 ), plural "clouds" ( Job 35:5 ;  36:28 ;  Psalms 68:34 , marg. "heavens"), means probably the firmament.  </p><p> (e) Heb. rakia is closely connected with (d), and is rendered "firmamentum" in the Vulgate, whence our "firmament" ( Genesis 1:6 ;  Deuteronomy 33:26 , etc.), regarded as a solid expanse.  </p></li><li> Metaphorical meaning of term.  Isaiah 14:13 Isaiah 14:14 ; "doors of heaven" ( Psalms 78:23 ); heaven "shut" ( 1 Kings 8:35 ); "opened" ( Ezekiel 1:1 ). (See   1 Chronicles 21:16 .)  </li><li> Spiritual meaning. The place of the everlasting blessedness of the righteous; the abode of departed spirits.  <p> (a) Christ calls it his "Father's house" ( John 14:2 ).  </p><p> (b) It is called "paradise" ( Luke 23:43 ;  2 co  12:4 ;  Revelation 2:7 ).  </p><p> (c) "The heavenly Jerusalem" ( Galatians 4: :  <span class="badLink">26</span> ;  Hebrews 12:22 ;  Revelation 3:12 ).  </p><p> (d) The "kingdom of heaven" ( Matthew 25:1 ;  James 2:5 ).  </p><p> (e) The "eternal kingdom" ( 2 Peter 1:11 ).  </p><p> (f) The "eternal inheritance" ( 1 Peter 1:4 ;  Hebrews 9:15 ).  </p><p> (g) The "better country" ( Hebrews 11:14 Hebrews 11:16 ).  </p><p> (h) The blessed are said to "sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob," and to be "in Abraham's bosom" ( Luke 16:22 ;  Matthew 8:11 ); to "reign with Christ" ( 2 Timothy 2:12 ); and to enjoy "rest" ( Hebrews 4:10 Hebrews 4:11 ).  </p><p> In heaven the blessedness of the righteous consists in the possession of "life everlasting," "an eternal weight of glory" ( 2 Corinthians 4:17 ), an exemption from all sufferings for ever, a deliverance from all evils ( 2 Corinthians 5:1 2 Corinthians 5:2 ) and from the society of the wicked ( 2 Timothy 4:18 ), bliss without termination, the "fulness of joy" for ever ( Luke 20:36 ;  2 co  Luke 4:16 Luke 4:18 ;  1 Peter 1:4 ;  5:10 ;  1 John 3:2 ). The believer's heaven is not only a state of everlasting blessedness, but also a "place", a place "prepared" for them ( John 14:2 ).  </p> </li>
Heber	<p>passing over. </p><li> Son of Beriah and grandson of Asher ( Genesis 46:17 ;  1 Chronicles 7:31 1 Chronicles 7:32 ).  </li><li> The Kenite ( Judges 4:11 Judges 4:17 ;  5:24 ), a descendant of Hobab. His wife Jael received Sisera (q.v.) into her tent and then killed him.  </li><li> 1 Chronicles 4:18 .  </li><li> A Benjamite ( 1 Chronicles 8:17 ).  </li><li> A Gadite ( 5:13 ). (See EBER .)  </li>
Hebrew	<p>a name applied to the Israelites in Scripture only by one who is a foreigner ( Genesis 39:14 Genesis 39:17 ;  41:12 , etc.), or by the Israelites when they speak of themselves to foreigners ( 40:15 ;  Exodus 1:19 ), or when spoken of an contrasted with other peoples ( Genesis 43:32 ;  Exodus 1:3 Exodus 1:7 Exodus 1:15 ;  Deuteronomy 15:12 ). In the New Testament there is the same contrast between Hebrews and foreigners ( Acts 6:1 ;  Philippians 3:5 ).  </p><p> Derivation. </p><li> The name is derived, according to some, from Eber ( Genesis 10:24 ), the ancestor of Abraham. The Hebrews are "sons of Eber" ( 10:21 ).  </li><li> Others trace the name of a Hebrew root-word signifying "to pass over," and hence regard it as meaning "the man who passed over," viz., the Euphrates; or to the Hebrew word meaning "the region" or "country beyond," viz., the land of Chaldea. This latter view is preferred. It is the more probable origin of the designation given to Abraham coming among the Canaanites as a man from beyond the Euphrates ( Genesis 14:13 ).  </li><li> A third derivation of the word has been suggested, viz., that it is from the Hebrew word <i> 'abhar</i> , "to pass over," whence <i> 'ebher</i> , in the sense of a "sojourner" or "passer through" as distinct from a "settler" in the land, and thus applies to the condition of Abraham ( Hebrews 11:13 ).   </li>
Hebrew language	<p>the language of the Hebrew nation, and that in which the Old Testament is written, with the exception of a few portions in Chaldee. In the Old Testament it is only spoken of as "Jewish" ( 2 Kings 18:26 2 Kings 18:28 ;  Isaiah 36:11 Isaiah 36:13 ;  2 Chr  32:18 ). This name is first used by the Jews in times subsequent to the close of the Old Testament.  </p><p> It is one of the class of languages called Semitic, because they were chiefly spoken among the descendants of Shem. </p><p> When Abraham entered Canaan it is obvious that he found the language of its inhabitants closely allied to his own. ( Isaiah 19:18 ) calls it "the language of Canaan." Whether this language, as seen in the earliest books of the Old Testament, was the very dialect which Abraham brought with him into Canaan, or whether it was the common tongue of the Canaanitish nations which he only adopted, is uncertain; probably the latter opinion is the correct one. For the thousand years between Moses and the Babylonian exile the Hebrew language underwent little or no modification. It preserves all through a remarkable uniformity of structure. From the first it appears in its full maturity of development. But through intercourse with Damascus, Assyria, and Babylon, from the time of David, and more particularly from the period of the Exile, it comes under the influence of the Aramaic idiom, and this is seen in the writings which date from this period. It was never spoken in its purity by the Jews after their return from Babylon. They now spoke Hebrew with a large admixture of Aramaic or Chaldee, which latterly became the predominant element in the national language.  </p><p> The Hebrew of the Old Testament has only about six thousand words, all derived from about five hundred roots. Hence the same word has sometimes a great variety of meanings. So long as it was a living language, and for ages after, only the consonants of the words were written. This also has been a source of difficulty in interpreting certain words, for the meaning varies according to the vowels which may be supplied. The Hebrew is one of the oldest languages of which we have any knowledge. It is essentially identical with the Phoenician language. (See MOABITE STONE .) The Semitic languages, to which class the Hebrew and Phoenician belonged, were spoken over a very wide area: in Babylonia, Mesopotamia, Syria, Palestine and Arabia, in all the countries from the Mediterranean to the borders of Assyria, and from the mountains of Armenia to the Indian Ocean. The rounded form of the letters, as seen in the Moabite stone, was probably that in which the ancient Hebrew was written down to the time of the Exile, when the present square or Chaldean form was adopted. </p>
Ibhar	<p>chosen, one of David's sons ( 1 Chronicles 3:6 ;  2 Sam  5:15 ).  </p>
Ibleam	<p>people-waster, a city assigned to Manasseh ( Joshua 17:11 ), from which the Israelites, however, could not expel the Canaanites ( Judges 1:27 ). It is also called Bileam ( 1 Chronicles 6:70 ). It was probably the modern Jelamah, a village 2 1/2 miles north of Jenin.  </p>
Ibzan	<p>illustrious, the tenth judge of Israel ( Judges 12:8-10 ). He ruled seven years.  </p>
Ice	<p>frequently mentioned ( Job 6:16 ;  38:29 ;  Psalms 147:17 , etc.). (See CRYSTAL .) </p>
Ichabod	<p>When the tidings of the disastrous defeat of the Israelites in the battle against the Philistines near to Mizpeh were carried to Shiloh, the wife of Phinehas "was near to be delivered. And when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed" ( 1 Samuel 4:19-22 ). In her great distress she regarded not "the women that stood by her," but named the child that was born "Ichabod" i.e., no glory, saying, "The glory is departed from Isreal;" and with that word on her lips she expired.  </p>
Iconium	<p>the capital of ancient Lycaonia. It was first visited by Paul and Barnabas from Antioch-in-Pisidia during the apostle's first missionary journey ( Acts 13:50 Acts 13:51 ). Here they were persecuted by the Jews, and being driven from the city, they fled to Lystra. They afterwards returned to Iconium, and encouraged the church which had been founded there ( Acts 14:21 Acts 14:22 ). It was probably again visited by Paul during his third missionary journey along with Silas ( 18:23 ). It is the modern Konieh, at the foot of Mount Taurus, about 120 miles inland from the Mediterranean.  </p>
Idalah	<p>snares(?), a city near the west border of Zebulun ( Joshua 19:15 ). It has been identified with the modern Jeida, in the valley of Kishon.  </p>
Iddo	<p></p><li> Timely ( 1 Chronicles 6:21 ). A Gershonite Levite.  </li><li> Lovely. The son of Zechariah ( 1 Chronicles 27:21 ), the ruler of Manasseh in David's time.  </li><li> Timely. The father of Ahinadab, who was one of Solomon's purveyors ( 1 Kings 4:14 ).  </li><li> Lovely. A prophet of Judah who wrote the history of Rehoboam and Abijah ( 2 Chronicles 12:15 ). He has been identified with Oded ( 2 Chronicles 15:1 ).  </li><li> Lovely. The father of Berachiah, and grandfather of the prophet Zechariah ( Zechariah 1:1 Zechariah 1:7 ). He returned from Babylon ( Nehemiah 12:4 ).   </li>
Idol	<p></p><li> Heb. aven, "nothingness;" "vanity" ( Isaiah 66:3 ;  41:29 ;  Deuteronomy 32:21 ;  1 Kings 16:13 ;  Psalms 31:6 ;  Jeremiah 8:19 , etc.).  </li><li> 'Elil, "a thing of naught" ( Psalms 97:7 ;  Isaiah 19:3 ); a word of contempt, used of the gods of Noph ( Ezekiel 30:13 ).  </li><li> 'Emah, "terror," in allusion to the hideous form of idols ( Jeremiah 50:38 ).  </li><li> Miphletzeth, "a fright;" "horror" ( 1 Kings 15:13 ;  2 Chr.  15:16 ).  </li><li> Bosheth, "shame;" "shameful thing" ( Jeremiah 11:13 ;  Hosea 9:10 ); as characterizing the obscenity of the worship of Baal.  </li><li> Gillulim, also a word of contempt, "dung;" "refuse" ( Ezekiel 16:36 ;  20:8 ;  Deuteronomy 29:17 , marg.).  </li><li> Shikkuts, "filth;" "impurity" ( Ezekiel 37:23 ;  Nahum 3:6 ).  </li><li> Semel, "likeness;" "a carved image" ( Deuteronomy 4:16 ).  </li><li> Tselem, "a shadow" ( Daniel 3:1 ;  1 Samuel 6:5 ), as distinguished from the "likeness," or the exact counterpart.  </li><li> Temunah, "similitude" ( Deuteronomy 4:12-19 ). Here Moses forbids the several forms of Gentile idolatry.  </li><li> 'Atsab, "a figure;" from the root "to fashion," "to labour;" denoting that idols are the result of man's labour ( Isaiah 48:5 ;  Psalms 139:24 , "wicked way;" literally, as some translate, "way of an idol").  </li><li> Tsir, "a form;" "shape" ( Isaiah 45:16 ).  </li><li> Matztzebah, a "statue" set up ( Jeremiah 43:13 ); a memorial stone like that erected by Jacob ( Genesis 28:18 ;  31:45 ;  Genesis 35:14 Genesis 35:20 ), by ( Joshua 4:9 ), and by Samuel ( 1 Samuel 7:12 ). It is the name given to the statues of Baal ( 2 Kings 3:2 ;  10:27 ).  </li><li> Hammanim, "sun-images." Hamman is a synonym of Baal, the sun-god of the Phoenicians ( 2 Chronicles 34:4 2 Chronicles 34:7 ;  2 Chronicles 14:3 2 Chronicles 14:5 ;  Isaiah 17:8 ).  </li><li> Maskith, "device" ( Leviticus 26:1 ;  Numbers 33:52 ). In  Leviticus 26:1 , the words "image of stone" (A.V.) denote "a stone or cippus with the image of an idol, as Baal, Astarte, etc." In  Ezekiel 8:12 , "chambers of imagery" (maskith), are "chambers of which the walls are painted with the figures of idols;" Compare ver. 10,11.  </li><li> Pesel, "a graven" or "carved image" ( Isaiah 44:10-20 ). It denotes also a figure cast in metal ( Deuteronomy 7:25 ;  27:15 ;  Isaiah 40:19 ;  44:10 ).  </li><li> Massekah, "a molten image" ( Deuteronomy 9:12 ;  Judges 17:3 Judges 17:4 ).  </li><li> Teraphim, pl., "images," family gods (penates) worshipped by Abram's kindred ( Joshua 24:14 ). Put by Michal in David's bed ( Judges 17:5 ;  Judges 18:14 Judges 18:17 Judges 18:18 Judges 18:20 ;  1 Samuel 19:13 ).  <p> "Nothing can be more instructive and significant than this multiplicity and variety of words designating the instruments and inventions of idolatry." </p> </li>
Idolatry	<p>image-worship or divine honour paid to any created object. Paul describes the origin of idolatry in  Romans 1:21-25 : men forsook God, and sank into ignorance and moral corruption ( 1:28 ).  </p><p> The forms of idolatry are, </p><li> Fetishism, or the worship of trees, rivers, hills, stones, etc.  </li><li> Nature worship, the worship of the sun, moon, and stars, as the supposed powers of nature.  </li><li> Hero worship, the worship of deceased ancestors, or of heroes.  <p> In Scripture, idolatry is regarded as of heathen origin, and as being imported among the Hebrews through contact with heathen nations. The first allusion to idolatry is in the account of Rachel stealing her father's teraphim ( Genesis 31:19 ), which were the relics of the worship of other gods by Laban's progenitors "on the other side of the river in old time" ( Joshua 24:2 ). During their long residence in Egypt the Hebrews fell into idolatry, and it was long before they were delivered from it ( Joshua 24:14 ;  Ezekiel 20:7 ). Many a token of God's displeasure fell upon them because of this sin.  </p><p> The idolatry learned in Egypt was probably rooted out from among the people during the forty years' wanderings; but when the Jews entered Palestine, they came into contact with the monuments and associations of the idolatry of the old Canaanitish races, and showed a constant tendency to depart from the living God and follow the idolatrous practices of those heathen nations. It was their great national sin, which was only effectually rebuked by the Babylonian exile. That exile finally purified the Jews of all idolatrous tendencies. </p><p> The first and second commandments are directed against idolatry of every form. Individuals and communities were equally amenable to the rigorous code. The individual offender was devoted to destruction ( Exodus 22:20 ). His nearest relatives were not only bound to denounce him and deliver him up to punishment ( <span class="badLink">Deuteronomy 13:20-10</span> ), but their hands were to strike the first blow when, on the evidence of two witnesses at least, he was stoned ( Deuteronomy 17:2-7 ). To attempt to seduce others to false worship was a crime of equal enormity ( 13:6-10 ). An idolatrous nation shared the same fate. No facts are more strongly declared in the Old Testament than that the extermination of the Canaanites was the punishment of their idolatry ( Exodus 34:15 Exodus 34:16 ;  Deuteronomy 7 ;  12:29-31 ;  20:17 ), and that the calamities of the Israelites were due to the same cause ( Jeremiah 2:17 ). "A city guilty of idolatry was looked upon as a cancer in the state; it was considered to be in rebellion, and treated according to the laws of war. Its inhabitants and all their cattle were put to death." Jehovah was the theocratic King of Israel, the civil Head of the commonwealth, and therefore to an Israelite idolatry was a state offence ( 1 Samuel 15:23 ), high treason. On taking possession of the land, the Jews were commanded to destroy all traces of every kind of the existing idolatry of the Canaanites ( Exodus 23:24 Exodus 23:32 ;  34:13 ;  Deuteronomy 7:5 Deuteronomy 7:25 ;  12:1-3 ).  </p><p> In the New Testament the term idolatry is used to designate covetousness ( Matthew 6:24 ;  Luke 16:13 ;  Colossians 3:5 ;  Ephesians 5:5 ).  </p> </li>
Idumaea	<p>the Greek form of Edom ( Isaiah 34:5 Isaiah 34:6 ;  Ezekiel 35:15 ;  36:5 , but in RSV "Edom"). (See EDOM).  </p>
Igal	<p>avengers. </p><li> Numbers 13:7 , one of the spies of the tribe of Issachar. </li><li> Son of Nathan of Zobah, and one of David's warriors ( 2 Samuel 23:36 ). </li><li> 1 Chronicles 3:22 .   </li>
Iim	<p>ruins. </p><li> A city in the south of Judah ( Joshua 15:29 ).  </li><li> One of the stations of the Israelites in the wilderness ( Numbers 33:45 ).   </li>
Ije-abarim	<p>ruins of Abarim, the forty-seventh station of the Israelites in the wilderness, "in the border of Moab" ( Numbers 33:44 ).  </p>
Ijon	<p>a ruin, a city of Naphtali, captured by Ben-hadad of Syria at the instance of Asa ( 1 Kings 15:20 ), and afterwards by Tiglath-pileser of Assyria ( 2 Kings 15:29 ) in the reign of Pekah; now el-Khiam.  </p>
Ilai	<p>an Ahohite, one of David's chief warriors ( 1 Chronicles 11:29 ); called also Zalmon ( 2 Samuel 23:28 ).  </p>
Illyricum	<p>a country to the north-west of Macedonia, on the eastern shores of the Adriatic, now almost wholly comprehended in Dalmatia, a name formerly given to the southern part of Illyricum ( 2 Timothy 4:10 ). It was traversed by Paul in his third missionary journey ( Romans 15:19 ). It was the farthest district he had reached in preaching the gospel of Christ. This reference to Illyricum is in harmony with  Acts 20:2 , inasmuch as the apostle's journey over the parts of Macedonia would bring him to the borders of Illyricum.  </p>
Imagery	<p>only in the phrase "chambers of his imagery" ( Ezekiel 8:12 ). (See CHAMBER .) </p>
Imla	<p>replenisher, the father of Micaiah the prophet ( 2 Chronicles 18:7 2 Chronicles 18:8 ).  </p>
Immanuel	<p>God with us. In the Old Testament it occurs only in  Isaiah 7:14  and  8:8 . Most Christian interpreters have regarded these words as directly and exclusively a prophecy of our Saviour, an interpretation borne out by the words of the evangelist ( Matthew 1:23 ).  </p>
Immer	<p>talkative. </p><li> The head of the sixteenth priestly order ( 1 Chronicles 24:14 ). </li><li> Jeremiah 20:1 . </li><li> Ezra 2:37 ;  Nehemiah 7:40 . </li><li> Ezra 2:59 ;  Nehemiah 7:61 . </li><li> The father of Zadok ( Nehemiah 3:29 ).   </li>
Immortality	<p>perpetuity of existence. The doctrine of immortality is taught in the Old Testament. It is plainly implied in the writings of Moses ( Genesis 5:22 Genesis 5:24 ;  25:8 ;  37:35 ;  47:9 ;  49:29 , Compare  Hebrews 11:13-16 ;  Exodus 3:6 , Compare  Matthew 22:23 ). It is more clearly and fully taught in the later books ( Isaiah 14:9 ;  Psalms 17:15 ;  49:15 ;  73:24 ). It was thus a doctrine obviously well known to the Jews.  </p><p> With the full revelation of the gospel this doctrine was "brought to light" ( 2 Timothy 1:10 ;  1 Corinthians 15 ;  2 co  5:1-6 ;  1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 ).  </p>
Imputation	<p>is used to designate any action or word or thing as reckoned to a person. Thus in doctrinal language (1) the sin of Adam is imputed to all his descendants, i.e., it is reckoned as theirs, and they are dealt with therefore as guilty; (2) the righteousness of Christ is imputed to them that believe in him, or so attributed to them as to be considered their own; and (3) our sins are imputed to Christ, i.e., he assumed our "law-place," undertook to answer the demands of justice for our sins. In all these cases the nature of imputation is the same ( Romans 5:12-19 ; Compare  Philemon 1:18 Philemon 1:19 ).  </p>
Incarnation	<p>that act of grace whereby Christ took our human nature into union with his Divine Person, became man. Christ is both God and man. Human attributes and actions are predicated of him, and he of whom they are predicated is God. A Divine Person was united to a human nature ( Acts 20:28 ;  Romans 8:32 ;  1 Corinthians 2:8 ;  Hebrews 2:11-14 ;  1 Timothy 3:16 ;  Galatians 4:4 , etc.). The union is hypostatical, i.e., is personal; the two natures are not mixed or confounded, and it is perpetual.  </p>
Incense	<p>a fragrant composition prepared by the "art of the apothecary." It consisted of four ingredients "beaten small" ( Exodus 30:34-36 ). That which was not thus prepared was called "strange incense" ( 30:9 ). It was offered along with every meat-offering; and besides was daily offered on the golden altar in the holy place, and on the great day of atonement was burnt by the high priest in the holy of holies ( Exodus 30:7 Exodus 30:8 ). It was the symbol of prayer ( Psalms 141:1 Psalms 141:2 ;  Revelation 5:8 ;  Revelation 8:3 Revelation 8:4 ).  </p>
India	<p>occurs only in  Esther 1:1  and  8:9 , where the extent of the dominion of the Persian king is described. The country so designated here is not the peninsula of Hindustan, but the country surrounding the Indus, the Punjab. The people and the products of India were well known to the Jews, who seem to have carried on an active trade with that country ( Ezekiel 27:15 Ezekiel 27:24 ).  </p>
Inkhorn	<p>The Hebrew word so rendered means simply a round vessel or cup for containing ink, which was generally worn by writers in the girdle ( Ezekiel 9:2 Ezekiel 9:3 Ezekiel 9:11 ). The word "inkhorn" was used by the translators, because in former times in this country horns were used for containing ink.  </p>
Inn	<p>in the modern sense, unknown in the East. The khans or caravanserais, which correspond to the European inn, are not alluded to in the Old Testament. The "inn" mentioned in  Exodus 4:24  was just the halting-place of the caravan. In later times khans were erected for the accommodation of travellers. In  Luke 2:7  the word there so rendered denotes a place for loosing the beasts of their burdens. It is rendered "guest-chamber" in  Mark 14:14  and  Luke 22:11 . In  Luke 10:34  the word so rendered is different. That inn had an "inn-keeper," who attended to the wants of travellers.  </p>
Inspiration	<p>that extraordinary or supernatural divine influence vouchsafed to those who wrote the Holy Scriptures, rendering their writings infallible. "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" (RSV, "Every scripture inspired of God"),  2 Timothy 3:16 . This is true of all the "sacred writings," not in the sense of their being works of genius or of supernatural insight, but as "theopneustic," i.e., "breathed into by God" in such a sense that the writers were supernaturally guided to express exactly what God intended them to express as a revelation of his mind and will. The testimony of the sacred writers themselves abundantly demonstrates this truth; and if they are infallible as teachers of doctrine, then the doctrine of plenary inspiration must be accepted. There are no errors in the Bible as it came from God, none have been proved to exist. Difficulties and phenomena we cannot explain are not errors. All these books of the Old and New Testaments are inspired. We do not say that they contain, but that they are, the Word of God. The gift of inspiration rendered the writers the organs of God, for the infallible communication of his mind and will, in the very manner and words in which it was originally given.  </p><p> As to the nature of inspiration we have no information. This only we know, it rendered the writers infallible. They were all equally inspired, and are all equally infallible. The inspiration of the sacred writers did not change their characters. They retained all their individual peculiarities as thinkers or writers. (See BIBLE; WORD OF GOD .) </p>
Intercession of Christ	<p>Christ's priestly office consists of these two parts, (1) the offering up of himself as a sacrifice, and (2) making continual intercession for us.  </p><p> When on earth he made intercession for his people ( Luke 23:34 ;  John 17:20 ;  Hebrews 5:7 ); but now he exercises this function of his priesthood in heaven, where he is said to appear in the presence of God for us ( Hebrews 9:12 Hebrews 9:24 ).  </p><p> His advocacy with the Father for his people rests on the basis of his own all-perfect sacrifice. Thus he pleads for and obtains the fulfilment of all the promises of the everlasting covenant ( 1 John 2:1 ;  John 17:24 ;  Hebrews 7:25 ). He can be "touched with the feeling of our infirmities," and is both a merciful and a faithful high priest ( Hebrews 2:17 Hebrews 2:18 ;  Hebrews 4:15 Hebrews 4:16 ). This intercession is an essential part of his mediatorial work. Through him we have "access" to the Father ( John 14:6 ;  Ephesians 2:18 ;  3:12 ). "The communion of his people with the Father will ever be sustained through him as mediatorial Priest" ( Psalms 110:4 ;  Revelation 7:17 ).  </p>
Intercession of the Spirit	<p>( Romans 8:26 Romans 8:27 ;  John 14:26 ). "Christ is a royal Priest ( Zechariah 6:13 ). From the same throne, as King, he dispenses his Spirit to all the objects of his care, while as Priest he intercedes for them. The Spirit acts for him, taking only of his things. They both act with one consent, Christ as principal, the Spirit as his agent. Christ intercedes for us, without us, as our advocate in heaven, according to the provisions of the everlasting covenant. The Holy Spirit works upon our minds and hearts, enlightening and quickening, and thus determining our desires 'according to the will of God,' as our advocate within us. The work of the one is complementary to that of the other, and together they form a complete whole.", Hodge's Outlines of Theology.  </p>
Iphedeiah	<p>set free by Jehovah, a chief of the tribe of Benjamin ( 1 Chronicles 8:25 ).  </p>
Ira	<p>citizen; wakeful. </p><li> A Tekoite, one of David's thirty warriors ( 2 Samuel 23:26 ).  </li><li> An Ithrite, also one of David's heroes ( 2 Samuel 23:38 ).  </li><li> A Jairite and priest, a royal chaplain ( 2 Samuel 20:26 ) or confidential adviser (Compare  2 Samuel 8:18 ;  1 Chronicles 18:17 ).   </li>
Jaakan	<p>he twists, one of the sons of Ezer, the son of Seir the Horite ( 1 Chronicles 1:42 ).  </p>
Jaakobah	<p>heel-catcher, a form of the name Jacob, one of the descendants of Simeon ( 1 Chronicles 4:36 ).  </p>
Jaala	<p>a wild she-goat, one of the Nethinim, whose descendants returned from the Captivity ( Nehemiah 7:58 ).  </p>
Jaalam	<p>concealer, the second of Esau's three sons by Aholibamah ( Genesis 36:5 Genesis 36:14 ).  </p>
Jaanai	<p>mourner, one of the chief Gadites ( 1 Chronicles 5:12 ).  </p>
Jaare-oregim	<p>forests of the weavers, a Bethlehemite ( 2 Samuel 21:19 ), and the father of Elhanan, who slew Goliath. In  1 Chronicles 20:5  called JAIR.  </p>
Jaasau	<p>fabricator, an Israelite who renounced his Gentile wife after the Return ( Ezra 10:37 ).  </p>
Jaasiel	<p>made by God, one of David's body-guard, the son of Abner ( 1 Chronicles 27:21 ), called Jasiel in  1 Chronicles 11:47 .  </p>
Jaaz-aniah	<p>heard by Jehovah. </p><li> The son of Jeremiah, and one of the chief Rechabites ( Jeremiah 35:3 ).  </li><li> The son of Shaphan ( Ezekiel 8:11 ).  </li><li> The son of Azur, one of the twenty-five men seen by ( Ezekiel 11:1 ) at the east gate of the temple.  </li><li> A Maachathite ( 2 Kings 25:23 ;  Jeremiah 40:8 ;  42:1 ). He is also called Azariah ( Jeremiah 43:2 ).   </li>
Jaazer	<p>he (God) helps, a city of the Amorites on the east of Jordan, and assigned, with neighbouring places in Gilead, to Gad ( Numbers 32:1 Numbers 32:35 ;  Joshua 13:25 ). It was allotted to the Merarite Levites ( 21:39 ). In David's time it was occupied by the Hebronites, i.e., the descendants of Kohath ( 1 Chronicles 26:31 ). It is mentioned in the "burdens" proclaimed over Moab ( Isaiah 16:8 Isaiah 16:9 ;  Jeremiah 48:32 ). Its site is marked by the modern ruin called Sar or Seir, about 10 miles west of Amman, and 12 from Heshbon. "The vineyards that once covered the hill-sides are gone; and the wild Bedawin from the eastern desert make cultivation of any kind impossible."  </p>
Jaaziah	<p>comforted by Jehovah, a descendant of Merari the Levite ( 1 Chronicles 24:26 1 Chronicles 24:27 ).  </p>
Jaaziel	<p>comforted by God, a Levitical musician ( 1 Chronicles 15:18 ).  </p>
Jabal	<p>a stream, a descendant of Cain, and brother of Jubal; "the father of such as dwell in tents and have cattle" ( Genesis 4:20 ). This description indicates that he led a wandering life.  </p>
Jabbok	<p>a pouring out, or a wrestling, one of the streams on the east of Jordan, into which it falls about midway between the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea, or about 45 miles below the Sea of Galilee. It rises on the eastern side of the mountains of Gilead, and runs a course of about 65 miles in a wild and deep ravine. It was the boundary between the territory of the Ammonites and that of Og, king of Bashan ( Joshua 12:1-5 ;  Numbers 21:24 ); also between the tribe of Reuben and the half tribe of Manasseh ( 21:24 ;  Deuteronomy 3:16 ). In its course westward across the plains it passes more than once underground. "The scenery along its banks is probably the most picturesque in Palestine; and the ruins of town and village and fortress which stud the surrounding mountain-side render the country as interesting as it is beautiful." This river is now called the Zerka, or blue river.  </p>
Jabesh	<p>dry. </p><li> For Jabesh-Gilead ( 1 Samuel 11:3 1 Samuel 11:9 1 Samuel 11:10 ).  </li><li> The father of Shallum ( 2 Kings 15:10 2 Kings 15:13 2 Kings 15:14 ), who usurped the throne of Israel on the death of Zachariah.   </li>
Jabesh-Gilead	<p>a town on the east of Jordan, on the top of one of the green hills of Gilead, within the limits of the half tribe of Manasseh, and in full view of Beth-shan. It is first mentioned in connection with the vengeance taken on its inhabitants because they had refused to come up to Mizpeh to take part with Israel against the tribe of Benjamin ( Judges 21:8-14 ). After the battles at Gibeah, that tribe was almost extinguished, only six hundred men remaining. An expedition went against Jabesh-Gilead, the whole of whose inhabitants were put to the sword, except four hundred maidens, whom they brought as prisoners and sent to "proclaim peace" to the Benjamites who had fled to the crag Rimmon. These captives were given to them as wives, that the tribe might be saved from extinction (Judg. 21).  </p><p> This city was afterwards taken by Nahash, king of the Ammonites, but was delivered by Saul, the newly-elected king of Israel. In gratitude for this deliverance, forty years after this, the men of Jabesh-Gilead took down the bodies of Saul and of his three sons from the walls of Beth-shan, and after burning them, buried the bones under a tree near the city ( 1 Samuel 31:11-13 ). David thanked them for this act of piety ( 2 Samuel 2:4-6 ), and afterwards transferred the remains to the royal sepulchre ( 21:14 ). It is identified with the ruins of ed-Deir, about 6 miles south of Pella, on the north of the Wady Yabis.  </p>
Jabez	<p>affiction. </p><li> A descendant of Judah, of whom it is recorded that "God granted him that which he requested" ( 1 Chronicles 4:9 1 Chronicles 4:10 ).  </li><li> A place inhabited by several families of the scribes ( 1 Chronicles 2:55 ).   </li>
Jabin	<p>discerner; the wise. </p><li> A king of Hazor, at the time of the entrance of Israel into Canaan ( Joshua 11:1-14 ), whose overthrow and that of the northern chief with whom he had entered into a confederacy against Joshua was the crowning act in the conquest of the land ( 11:21-23 ; comp  14:6-15 ). This great battle, fought at Lake Merom, was the last of Joshua's battles of which we have any record. Here for the first time the Israelites encountered the iron chariots and horses of the Canaanites.  </li><li> Another king of Hazor, called "the king of Canaan," who overpowered the Israelites of the north one hundred and sixty years after Joshua's death, and for twenty years held them in painful subjection. The whole population were paralyzed with fear, and gave way to hopeless despondency ( Judges 5:6-11 ), till Deborah and Barak aroused the national spirit, and gathering together ten thousand men, gained a great and decisive victory over Jabin in the plain of Esdraelon ( Judges 4:10-16 ; Compare  Psalms 83:9 ). This was the first great victory Israel had gained since the days of Joshua. They never needed to fight another battle with the Canaanites ( Judges 5:31 ).   </li>
Jabneel	<p>built by God. </p><li> A town in the north boundary of Judah ( Joshua 15:11 ), called afterwards by the Greeks Jamnia, the modern Yebna, 11 miles south of Jaffa. After the fall of Jerusalem (A.D. 70), it became one of the most populous cities of Judea, and the seat of a celebrated school.  </li><li> A town on the border of Naphtali ( Joshua 19:33 ). Its later name was Kefr Yemmah, "the village by the sea," on the south shore of Lake Merom.   </li>
Jabneh	<p>building, ( 2 Chronicles 26:6 ), identical with Jabneel ( Joshua 15:11 ).  </p>
Jachan	<p>mourner, one of the chief Gadite "brothers" in Bashan ( 1 Chronicles 5:13 ).  </p>
Jachin	<p>firm. </p><li> The fourth son of Simeon ( Genesis 46:10 ), called also Jarib ( 1 Chronicles 4:24 ).  </li><li> The head of one of the courses (the twenty-first) of priests ( 1 Chronicles 24:17 ).  </li><li> One of the priests who returned from the Exile ( 1 Chronicles 9:10 ).   </li>
Jachin and Boaz	<p>the names of two brazen columns set up in Solomon's temple ( 1 Kings 7:15-22 ). Each was eighteen cubits high and twelve in circumference ( Jeremiah 52:21 Jeremiah 52:23 ;  1 Kings 7:17-21 ). They had doubtless a symbolical import.  </p>
Jacinth	<p>properly a flower of a reddish blue or deep purple (hyacinth), and hence a precious stone of that colour ( Revelation 21:20 ). It has been supposed to designate the same stone as the ligure (Heb. leshem) mentioned in  Exodus 28:19  as the first stone of the third row in the high priest's breast-plate. In  Revelation 9:17  the word is simply descriptive of colour.  </p>
Jacob	<p>one who follows on another's heels; supplanter, ( Genesis 25:26 ;  27:36 ;  Hosea 12:2-4 ), the second born of the twin sons of Isaac by Rebekah. He was born probably at Lahai-roi, when his father was fifty-nine and Abraham one hundred and fifty-nine years old. Like his father, he was of a quiet and gentle disposition, and when he grew up followed the life of a shepherd, while his brother Esau became an enterprising hunter. His dealing with Esau, however, showed much mean selfishness and cunning ( Genesis 25:29-34 ).  </p><p> When Isaac was about 160 years of age, Jacob and his mother conspired to deceive the aged patriarch ( Genesis 27 ), with the view of procuring the transfer of the birthright to himself. The birthright secured to him who possessed it (1) superior rank in his family ( Genesis 49:3 ); (2) a double portion of the paternal inheritance ( Deuteronomy 21:17 ); (3) the priestly office in the family ( Numbers 8:17-19 ); and (4) the promise of the See d in which all nations of the earth were to be blessed ( Genesis 22:18 ).  </p><p> Soon after his acquisition of his father's blessing ( Genesis 27 ), Jacob became conscious of his guilt; and afraid of the anger of Esau, at the suggestion of Rebekah Isaac sent him away to Haran, 400 miles or more, to find a wife among his cousins, the family of Laban, the Syrian (28). There he met with Rachel (29). Laban would not consent to give him his daughter in marriage till he had served seven years; but to Jacob these years "seemed but a few days, for the love he had to her." But when the seven years were expired, Laban craftily deceived Jacob, and gave him his daughter Leah. Other seven years of service had to be completed probably before he obtained the beloved Rachel. But "life-long sorrow, disgrace, and trials, in the retributive providence of God, followed as a consequence of this double union."  </p><p> At the close of the fourteen years of service, Jacob desired to return to his parents, but at the entreaty of Laban he tarried yet six years with him, tending his flocks ( 31:41 ). He then set out with his family and property "to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan" ( Genesis 31 ). Laban was angry when he heard that Jacob had set out on his journey, and pursued after him, overtaking him in seven days. The meeting was of a painful kind. After much recrimination and reproach directed against Jacob, Laban is at length pacified, and taking an affectionate farewell of his daughters, returns to his home in Padanaram. And now all connection of the Israelites with Mesopotamia is at an end.  </p><p> Soon after parting with Laban he is met by a company of angels, as if to greet him on his return and welcome him back to the Land of Promise ( Genesis 32:1 Genesis 32:2 ). He called the name of the place Mahanaim, i.e., "the double camp," probably his own camp and that of the angels. The vision of angels was the counterpart of that he had formerly seen at Bethel, when, twenty years before, the weary, solitary traveller, on his way to Padan-aram, saw the angels of God ascending and descending on the ladder whose top reached to heaven ( 28:12 ).  </p><p> He now hears with dismay of the approach of his brother Esau with a band of 400 men to meet him. In great agony of mind he prepares for the worst. He feels that he must now depend only on God, and he betakes himself to him in earnest prayer, and sends on before him a munificent present to Esau, "a present to my lord Esau from thy servant Jacob." Jacob's family were then transported across the Jabbok; but he himself remained behind, spending the night in communion with God. While thus engaged, there appeared one in the form of a man who wrestled with him. In this mysterious contest Jacob prevailed, and as a memorial of it his name was changed to Israel (wrestler with God); and the place where this occured he called Peniel, "for", said he, "I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved" ( 32:25-31 ).  </p><p> After this anxious night, Jacob went on his way, halting, mysteriously weakened by the conflict, but strong in the assurance of the divine favour. Esau came forth and met him; but his spirit of revenge was appeased, and the brothers met as friends, and during the remainder of their lives they maintained friendly relations. After a brief sojourn at Succoth, Jacob moved forward and pitched his tent near Shechem (q.v.),  33:18 ; but at length, under divine directions, he moved to Bethel, where he made an altar unto God ( Genesis 35:6 Genesis 35:7 ), and where God appeared to him and renewed the Abrahamic covenant. While journeying from Bethel to Ephrath (the Canaanitish name of Bethlehem), Rachel died in giving birth to her second son Benjamin ( 35:16-20 ), fifteen or sixteen years after the birth of Joseph. He then reached the old family residence at Mamre, to wait on the dying bed of his father Isaac. The complete reconciliation between Esau and Jacob was shown by their uniting in the burial of the patriarch ( 35:27-29 ).  </p><p> Jacob was soon after this deeply grieved by the loss of his beloved son Joseph through the jealousy of his brothers ( 37:33 ). Then follows the story of the famine, and the successive goings down into Egypt to buy corn (42), which led to the discovery of the long-lost Joseph, and the patriarch's going down with all his household, numbering about seventy souls ( Exodus 1:5 ;  Deuteronomy 10:22 ;  Acts 7:14 ), to sojourn in the land of Goshen. Here Jacob, "after being strangely tossed about on a very rough ocean, found at last a tranquil harbour, where all the best affections of his nature were gently exercised and largely unfolded" ( Genesis 48 ). At length the end of his checkered course draws nigh, and he summons his sons to his bedside that he may bless them. Among his last words he repeats the story of Rachel's death, although forty years had passed away since that event took place, as tenderly as if it had happened only yesterday; and when "he had made an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost" ( 49:33 ). His body was embalmed and carried with great pomp into the land of Canaan, and buried beside his wife Leah in the cave of Machpelah, according to his dying charge. There, probably, his embalmed body remains to this day ( 50:1-13 ). (See HEBRON .) </p><p> The history of Jacob is referred to by the prophets ( Hosea 12:3 Hosea 12:4 Hosea 12:12 ) and ( Malachi 1:2 ). In  Micah 1:5  the name is a poetic synonym for Israel, the kingdom of the ten tribes. There are, besides the mention of his name along with those of the other patriarchs, distinct references to events of his life in Paul's epistles ( Romans 9:11-13 ;  Hebrews 12:16 ;  11:21 ). See references to his vision at Bethel and his possession of land at Shechem in  John 1:51 ;  John 4:5 John 4:12 ; also to the famine which was the occasion of his going down into Egypt in  Acts 7:12  (See LUZ;  BETHEL .) </p>
Jacobs Well	<p>( John 4:5 John 4:6 ). This is one of the few sites in Palestine about which there is no dispute. It was dug by Jacob, and hence its name, in the "parcel of ground" which he purchased from the sons of Hamor ( Genesis 33:19 ). It still exists, but although after copious rains it contains a little water, it is now usually quite dry. It is at the entrance to the valley between Ebal and Gerizim, about 2 miles south-east of Shechem. It is about 9 feet in diameter and about 75 feet in depth, though in ancient times it was no doubt much deeper, probably twice as deep. The digging of such a well must have been a very laborious and costly undertaking.  </p><p> "Unfortunately, the well of Jacob has not escaped that misplaced religious veneration which cannot be satisfied with leaving the object of it as it is, but must build over it a shrine to protect and make it sacred. A series of buildings of various styles, and of different ages, have cumbered the ground, choked up the well, and disfigured the natural beauty and simplicity of the spot. At present the rubbish in the well has been cleared out; but there is still a domed structure over it, and you gaze down the shaft cut in the living rock and see at a depth of 70 feet the surface of the water glimmering with a pale blue light in the darkness, while you notice how the limestone blocks that form its curb have been worn smooth, or else furrowed by the ropes of centuries" (Hugh Macmillan).  </p><p> At the entrance of the enclosure round the well is planted in the ground one of the wooden poles that hold the telegraph wires between Jerusalem and Haifa. </p>
Jaddua	<p>known. </p><li> One of the chiefs who subscribed the covenant ( Nehemiah 10:21 ).  </li><li> The last high priest mentioned in the Old Testament ( Nehemiah 12:11 Nehemiah 12:22 ), sons of Jonathan.   </li>
Jadon	<p>judge, a Meronothite who assisted in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem ( Nehemiah 3:7 ).  </p>
Jael	<p>mountain-goat, the wife of Heber the Kenite ( Judges 4:17-22 ). When the Canaanites were defeated by Barak, Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, fled and sought refuge with the friendly tribe of Heber, beneath the oaks of Zaanaim. As he drew near, Jael invited him to enter her tent. He did so, and as he lay wearied on the floor he fell into a deep sleep. She then took in her left hand one of the great wooden pins ("nail") which fastened down the cords of the tent, and in her right hand the mallet, or "hammer," used for driving it into the ground, and stealthily approaching her sleeping guest, with one well-directed blow drove the nail through his temples into the earth ( Judges 5:27 ). She then led Barak, who was in pursuit, into her tent, and boastfully showed him what she had done. (See SISERA;  DEBORAH .) </p>
Jagur	<p>place of sojourn, a city on the southern border of Judah ( Joshua 15:21 ).  </p>
Jah	<p>a contraction for Jehovah ( Psalms 68:4 ).  </p>
Jahath	<p>union. </p><li> A son of Shimei, and grandson of Gershom ( 1 Chronicles 23:10 ).  </li><li> One of the sons of Shelomoth, of the family of Kohath ( 1 Chronicles 24:22 ).  </li><li> A Levite of the family of Merari, one of the overseers of the repairs of the temple under Josiah ( 2 Chronicles 34:12 ).   </li>
Jahaz	<p>trodden down (called also Jahaza,  Joshua 13:18 ; Jahazah,  21:36 ; Jahzah,  1 Chronicles 6:78 ), a town where Sihon was defeated, in the borders of Moab and in the land of the Ammonites beyond Jordan, and north of the river Arnon ( Numbers 21:23 ;  Deuteronomy 2:32 ). It was situated in the tribe of Reuben, and was assigned to the Merarite Levites ( Joshua 13:18 ;  21:36 ). Here was fought the decisive battle in which Sihon (q.v.) was completely routed, and his territory (the modern Belka) came into the possession of Israel. This town is mentioned in the denunciations of the prophets against Moab ( Isaiah 15:4 ;  Jeremiah 48:34 ).  </p>
Jahaziel	<p>beheld by God. </p><li> The third son of Hebron ( 1 Chronicles 23:19 ).  </li><li> A Benjamite chief who joined David at Ziklag ( 1 Chronicles 12:4 ).  </li><li> A priest who accompanied the removal of the ark to Jerusalem ( 1 Chronicles 16:6 ).  </li><li> The son of Zechariah, a Levite of the family of Asaph ( 2 Chronicles 20:14-17 ). He encouraged Jehoshaphat against the Moabites and Ammonites.   </li>
Jahdai	<p>grasper, a descendant of Caleb, of the family of Hezron ( 1 Chronicles 2:47 ).  </p>
Jahzeel	<p>allotted by God, the first of the sons of Naphtali ( Genesis 46:24 ).  </p>
Jahzerah	<p>returner, the son of Meshullam, and father of Adiel ( 1 Chronicles 9:12 ).  </p>
Jailer	<p>(of Philippi),  Acts 16:23 . The conversion of the Roman jailer, a man belonging to a class "insensible as a rule and hardened by habit, and also disposed to despise the Jews, who were the bearers of the message of the gospel," is one of those cases which illustrate its universality and power.  </p>
Jair	<p>enlightener. </p><li> The son of Segub. He was brought up with his mother in Gilead, where he had possessions ( 1 Chronicles 2:22 ). He distinguished himself in an expedition against Bashan, and settled in the part of Argob on the borders of Gilead. The small towns taken by him there are called Havoth-jair, i.e., "Jair's villages" ( Numbers 32:41 ;  Deuteronomy 3:14 ;  Joshua 13:30 ).  </li><li> The eighth judge of Israel, which he ruled for twenty-two years. His opulence is described in  Judges 10:3-5 . He had thirty sons, each riding on "ass colts." They had possession of thirty of the sixty cities ( 1 Kings 4:13 ;  1 Chronicles 2:23 ) which formed the ancient Havoth-jair.  </li><li> A Benjamite, the father of Mordecai, Esther's uncle ( Esther 2:5 ).  </li><li> The father of Elhanan, who slew Lahmi, the brother of Goliath ( 1 Chronicles 20:5 ).   </li>
Jairus	<p>a ruler of the synagogue at Capernaum, whose only daughter Jesus restored to life ( Mark 5:22 ;  Luke 8:41 ). Entering into the chamber of death, accompanied by Peter and James and John and the father and mother of the maiden, he went forward to the bed whereon the corpse lay, and said, Talitha cumi, i.e., "Maid, arise," and immediately the spirit of the maiden came to her again, and she arose straightway; and "at once to strengthen that life which had come back to her, and to prove that she was indeed no ghost, but had returned to the realities of a mortal existence, he commanded to give her something to eat" ( Mark 5:43 ).  </p>
Jakeh	<p>pious, the father of Agur ( Proverbs 30:1 ). Nothing is known of him.  </p>
Jakim	<p>establisher. </p><li> Chief of the twelfth priestly order ( 1 Chronicles 24:12 ).  </li><li> A Benjamite ( 1 Chronicles 8:19 ).  </li><li> Margin in  Matthew 1:11  means Jehoiakim.   </li>
Jalon	<p>lodger, the last of the four sons of Ezra, of the tribe of Judah ( 1 Chronicles 4:17 ).  </p>
Jambres	<p>one of those who opposed Moses in Egypt ( 2 Timothy 3:8 ). (See JANNES .) </p>
James	<p></p><li> The son of Zebedee and Salome; an elder brother of John the apostle. He was one of the twelve. He was by trade a fisherman, in partnership with Peter ( Matthew 20:20 ;  27:56 ). With John and Peter he was present at the transfiguration ( Matthew 17:1 ;  Mark 9:2 ), at the raising of Jairus's daughter ( Mark 5:37-43 ), and in the garden with our Lord ( 14:33 ). Because, probably, of their boldness and energy, he and John were called Boanerges, i.e., "sons of thunder." He was the first martyr among the apostles, having been beheaded by King Herod Agrippa ( Acts 12:1 Acts 12:2 ), A.D. 44. (Compare  Matthew 4:21 ;  20:20-23 ).  </li><li> The son of Alphaeus, or Cleopas, "the brother" or near kinsman or cousin of our Lord ( Galatians 1:18 Galatians 1:19 ), called James "the Less," or "the Little," probably because he was of low stature. He is mentioned along with the other apostles ( Matthew 10:3 ;  Mark 3:18 ;  Luke 6:15 ). He had a separate interview with our Lord after his resurrection ( 1 Corinthians 15:7 ), and is mentioned as one of the apostles of the circumcision ( Acts 1:13 ). He appears to have occupied the position of head of the Church at Jerusalem, where he presided at the council held to consider the case of the Gentiles ( Acts 12:17 ;  15:13-29 :  21:18-24 ). This James was the author of the epistle which bears his name.   </li>
James, Epistle of	<p></p><li> Author of, was James the Less, the Lord's brother, one of the twelve apostles. He was one of the three pillars of the Church ( Galatians 2:9 ).  </li><li> It was addressed to the Jews of the dispersion, "the twelve tribes scattered abroad."  </li><li> The place and time of the writing of the epistle were Jerusalem, where James was residing, and, from internal evidence, the period between Paul's two imprisonments at Rome, probably about A.D. 62.  </li><li> The object of the writer was to enforce the practical duties of the Christian life. "The Jewish vices against which he warns them are, formalism, which made the service of God consist in washings and outward ceremonies, whereas he reminds them ( 1:27 ) that it consists rather in active love and purity; fanaticism, which, under the cloak of religious zeal, was tearing Jerusalem in pieces ( 1:20 ); fatalism, which threw its sins on God ( 1:13 ); meanness, which crouched before the rich ( 2:2 ); falsehood, which had made words and oaths play-things ( 3:2-12 ); partisanship ( 3:14 ); evil speaking ( 4:11 ); boasting ( 4:16 ); oppression ( 5:4 ). The great lesson which he teaches them as Christians is patience, patience in trial ( 1:2 ), patience in good works ( 1:22-25 ), patience under provocation ( 3:17 ), patience under oppression ( 5:7 ), patience under persecution ( 5:10 ); and the ground of their patience is that the coming of the Lord draweth nigh, which is to right all wrong ( 5:8 )."  <p> "Justification by works," which James contends for, is justification before man, the justification of our profession of faith by a consistent life. Paul contends for the doctrine of "justification by faith;" but that is justification before God, a being regarded and accepted as just by virtue of the righteousness of Christ, which is received by faith. </p> </li>
Jannes	<p>one of the Egyptians who "withstood Moses" ( 2 Timothy 3:8 ).  </p>
Janoah	<p>or Jano'hah, rest. </p><li> A town on the north-eastern border of Ephraim, in the Jordan valley ( Joshua 16:6 Joshua 16:7 ). Identified with the modern Yanun, 8 miles south-east of Nablus.  </li><li> A town of Northern Palestine, within the boundaries of Naphtali. It was taken by the king of Assyria ( 2 Kings 15:29 ).   </li>
Janum	<p>slumber, a town in the mountains of Judah ( Joshua 15:53 ).  </p>
Japheth	<p>wide spreading: "God shall enlarge Japheth" (Heb. Yaphat Elohim le-Yephet,  Genesis 9:27 . Some, however, derive the name from <i> yaphah</i> , "to be beautiful;" hence white), one of the sons of Noah, mentioned last in order ( Genesis 5:32 ;  6:10 ;  7:13 ), perhaps first by birth ( 10:21 ; comp  9:24 ). He and his wife were two of the eight saved in the ark ( 1 Peter 3:20 ). He was the progenitor of many tribes inhabiting the east of Europe and the north of Asia ( Genesis 10:2-5 ). An act of filial piety ( 9:20-27 ) was the occasion of Noah's prophecy of the extension of his posterity.  </p><p> After the Flood the earth was re-peopled by the descendants of Noah, "the sons of Japheth" ( Genesis 10:2 ), "the sons of Ham" (6), and "the sons of Shem" (22). It is important to notice that modern ethnological science, reasoning from a careful analysis of facts, has arrived at the conclusion that there is a three-fold division of the human family, corresponding in a remarkable way with the great ethnological chapter of the book of Genesis (10). The three great races thus distinguished are called the Semitic, Aryan, and Turanian (Allophylian). "Setting aside the cases where the ethnic names employed are of doubtful application, it cannot reasonably be questioned that the author [of  Genesis 10 ] has in his account of the sons of Japheth classed together the Cymry or Celts (Gomer), the Medes (Madai), and the Ionians or Greeks (Javan), thereby anticipating what has become known in modern times as the 'Indo-European Theory,' or the essential unity of the Aryan (Asiatic) race with the principal races of Europe, indicated by the Celts and the Ionians. Nor can it be doubted that he has thrown together under the one head of 'children of Shem' the Assyrians (Asshur), the Syrians (Aram), the Hebrews (Eber), and the Joktanian Arabs (Joktan), four of the principal races which modern ethnology recognizes under the heading of 'Semitic.' Again, under the heading of 'sons of Ham,' the author has arranged 'Cush', i.e., the Ethiopians; 'Mizraim,' the people of Egypt; 'Sheba and Dedan,' or certain of the Southern Arabs; and 'Nimrod,' or the ancient people of Babylon, four races between which the latest linguistic researches have established a close affinity" (Rawlinson's Hist. Illustrations).  </p>
Japhia	<p>splendid. </p><li> The king of Lachish, who joined in the confederacy against Joshua ( Joshua 10:3 ), and was defeated and slain. In one of the Amarna tablets he speaks of himself as king of Gezer. Called also Horam ( Joshua 10:33 ).  </li><li> One of the sons of David ( 2 Samuel 5:15 ), born in Jerusalem.  </li><li> A town in the southern boundary of Zebulum ( Joshua 19:12 ); now Yafa, 2 miles south-west of Nazareth.   </li>
Japho	<p>beauty, a sea-port in Dan ( Joshua 19:46 ); called Joppa (q.v.) in  2 Chronicles 2:16 ;  Ezra 3:7 ;  Jonah 1:3 ; and in New Testament.  </p>
Jared	<p>descent. </p><li> The fourth antediluvian patriarch in descent from Seth ( Genesis 5:15-20 ;  Luke 3:37 ), the father of Enoch; called Jered in  1 Chronicles 1:2 .  </li><li> A son of Ezra probably ( 1 Chronicles 4:18 ).   </li>
Jarib	<p>an adversary. </p><li> A son of Simeon ( 1 Chronicles 4:24 ).  </li><li> One of the chiefs sent by Ezra to bring up the priests to Jerusalem ( Ezra 8:16 ).  </li><li> Ezra 10:18 .   </li>
Jarmuth	<p>height. </p><li> A town in the plain of Judah ( Joshua 15:35 ), originally the residence of one of the Canaanitish kings ( Joshua 10:3 Joshua 10:5 Joshua 10:23 ). It has been identified with the modern Yarmuk, a village about 7 miles north-east of Beit-Jibrin.  </li><li> A Levitical city of the tribe of Issachar ( Joshua 21:29 ), supposed by some to be the Ramah of Samuel ( 1 Samuel 19:22 ).   </li>
Jashen	<p>sleeping, called also Hashem ( 1 Chronicles 11:34 ); a person, several of whose sons were in David's body-guard ( 2 Samuel 23:32 ).  </p>
Jasher	<p>upright. "The Book of Jasher," rendered in the LXX. "the Book of the Upright One," by the Vulgate "the Book of Just Ones," was probably a kind of national sacred song-book, a collection of songs in praise of the heroes of Israel, a "book of golden deeds," a national anthology. We have only two specimens from the book, (1) the words of Joshua which he spake to the Lord at the crisis of the battle of Beth-horon ( Joshua 10:12 Joshua 10:13 ); and (2) "the Song of the Bow," that beautiful and touching mournful elegy which David composed on the occasion of the death of Saul and Jonathan ( 2 Samuel 1:18-27 ).  </p>
Jashobeam	<p>dweller among the people; or to whom the people turn, the Hachmonite ( 1 Chronicles 11:11 ), one of David's chief heroes who joined him at Ziklag ( 12:6 ). He was the first of the three who broke through the host of the Philistines to fetch water to David from the well of Bethlehem ( 2 Samuel 23:13-17 ). He is also called Adino the Eznite (8).  </p>
Jashub	<p>returner. </p><li> The third of Issachar's four sons ( 1 Chronicles 7:1 ); called also Job ( Genesis 46:13 ).  </li><li> Ezra 10:29 .   </li>
Jason	<p>he that will cure, the host of Paul and Silas in Thessalonica. The Jews assaulted his house in order to seize Paul, but failing to find him, they dragged Jason before the ruler of the city ( Acts 17:5-9 ). He was apparently one of the kinsmen of Paul ( Romans 16:21 ), and accompanied him from Thessalonica to Corinth.  </p>
Jasper	<p>(Heb. yashpheh, "glittering"), a gem of various colours, one of the twelve inserted in the high priest's breast-plate ( Exodus 28:20 ). It is named in the building of the New Jerusalem ( Revelation 21:18 Revelation 21:19 ). It was "most precious," "clear as crystal" ( 21:11 ). It was emblematic of the glory of God ( 4:3 ).  </p>
Jattir	<p>pre-eminent, a city in the mountains of Judah ( Joshua 15:48 ;  21:14 ).  </p>
Javan	<p></p><li> The fourth "son" of Japheth ( Genesis 10:2 ), whose descendants settled in Greece, i.e., Ionia, which bears the name of Javan in Hebrew. Alexander the Great is called the "king of Javan" (rendered "Grecia,"  Daniel 8:21 ;  10:20 ; comp  11:2 ;  Zechariah 9:13 ). This word was universally used by the nations of the East as the generic name of the Greek race.  </li><li> A town or district of Arabia Felix, from which the Syrians obtained iron, cassia, and calamus ( Ezekiel 27:19 ).   </li>
Javelin	<p></p><li> Heb. hanith, a lance, from its flexibility ( 1 Samuel 18:10 1 Samuel 18:11 ;  1 Samuel 19:9 1 Samuel 19:10 ;  20:33 ).  </li><li> Heb. romah, a lance for heavy-armed troops, so called from its piercing ( Numbers 25:7 ). (See ARMS .)  </li>
Jaw-bone	<p>of an ass afforded Samson a weapon for the great slaughter of the Philistines (Judg. 15.15), in which he slew a thousand men. In verse 19 the Authorized Version reads, "God clave a hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water thereout." This is a mis-translation of the words. The rendering should be as in the Revised Version, "God clave the hollow place that is in Lehi," etc., Lehi (q.v.) being the name of the hill where this conflict was waged, possibly so called because it was in shape like a jaw-bone.  </p>
Jealousy	<p>suspicion of a wife's purity, one of the strongest passions ( Numbers 5:14 ;  Proverbs 6:34 ; Cant  8:6 ); also an intense interest for another's honour or prosperity ( Psalms 79:5 ;  1 Corinthians 10:22 ;  Zechariah 1:14 ).  </p>
Jealousy offering	<p>the name of the offering the husband was to bring when he charged his wife with adultery ( Numbers 5:11-15 ).  </p>
Jealousy, Image of	<p>an idolatrous object, seen in vision by Ezekiel ( Ezekiel 8:3 Ezekiel 8:5 ), which stood in the priests' or inner court of the temple. Probably identical with the statue of Astarte ( 2 Kings 21:7 ).  </p>
Jealousy, Waters of	<p>water which the suspected wife was required to drink, so that the result might prove her guilt or innocence ( Numbers 5:12-17 Numbers 5:27 ). We have no record of this form of trial having been actually resorted to.  </p>
Jearim	<p>forests, a mountain on the border of Judah ( Joshua 15:10 ).  </p>
Jebus	<p>trodden hard, or fastness, or "the waterless hill", the name of the Canaanitish city which stood on Mount Zion ( Joshua 15:8 ;  Joshua 18:16 Joshua 18:28 ). It is identified with Jerusalem (q.v.) in Judg.  19:10 , and with the castle or city of David ( 1 Chronicles 11:4 1 Chronicles 11:5 ). It was a place of great natural strength, and its capture was one of David's most brilliant achievements ( 2 Samuel 5:8 ).  </p>
Jebusites	<p>the name of the original inhabitants of Jebus, mentioned frequently among the seven nations doomed to destruction ( Genesis 10:16 ;  15:21 ;  Exodus 3:8 Exodus 3:17 ;  13:5 , etc.). At the time of the arrival of the Israelites in Palestine they were ruled by Adonizedek ( Joshua 10:1 Joshua 10:23 ). They were defeated by Joshua, and their king was slain; but they were not entirely driven out of Jebus till the time of David, who made it the capital of his kingdom instead of Hebron. The site on which the temple was afterwards built belonged to Araunah, a Jebusite, from whom it was purchased by David, who refused to accept it as a free gift ( 2 Samuel 24:16-25 ;  1 Chronicles 21:24 1 Chronicles 21:25 ).  </p>
Jecoliah	<p>able through Jehovah, the wife of King Amaziah, and mother of King Uzziah ( 2 Chronicles 26:3 ).  </p>
Jedaiah	<p></p><li> Invoker of Jehovah. The son of Shimri, a chief Simeonite ( 1 Chronicles 4:37 ).  </li><li> One of those who repaired the walls of Jerusalem after the return from Babylon ( Nehemiah 3:10 ).  </li><li> Knowing Jehovah. The chief of one of the courses of the priests ( 1 Chronicles 24:7 ).  </li><li> A priest in Jerusalem after the Exile ( 1 Chronicles 9:10 ).   </li>
Jediael	<p>known by God. </p><li> One of the sons of Benjamin, whose descendants numbered 17,200 warriors ( 1 Chronicles 7:6 1 Chronicles 7:10 1 Chronicles 7:11 ).  </li><li> A Shimrite, one of David's bodyguard ( 1 Chronicles 11:45 ). Probably same as in  12:20 .  </li><li> A Korhite of the family of Ebiasaph, and one of the gate-keepers to the temple ( 1 Chronicles 26:2 ).   </li>
Jedidiah	<p>beloved by Jehovah, the name which, by the mouth of Nathan, the Lord gave to Solomon at his birth as a token of the divine favour ( 2 Samuel 12:25 ).  </p>
Jeduthun	<p>lauder; praising, a Levite of the family of Merari, and one of the three masters of music appointed by David ( 1 Chronicles 16:41 1 Chronicles 16:42 ;  25:1-6 ). He is called in  2 Chronicles 35:15  "the king's seer." His descendants are mentioned as singers and players on instruments ( Nehemiah 11:17 ). He was probably the same as Ethan ( 1 Chronicles 15:17 1 Chronicles 15:19 ). In the superscriptions to  Psalms 3962 ,62, and 77, the words "upon Jeduthun" probably denote a musical instrument; or they may denote the style or tune invented or introduced by Jeduthun, or that the psalm was to be sung by his choir.  </p>
Jegar-sahadutha	<p>pile of testimony, the Aramaic or Syriac name which Laban gave to the pile of stones erected as a memorial of the covenant between him and Jacob ( Genesis 31:47 ), who, however, called it in Hebrew by an equivalent name, Galeed (q.v.).  </p>
Jehaleleel	<p>praiser of God. </p><li> A descendant of Judah ( 1 Chronicles 4:16 ).  </li><li> A Levite of the family of Merari ( 2 Chronicles 29:12 ).   </li>
Jehdeiah	<p>rejoicer in Jehovah. </p><li> One of the Levitical attendants at the temple, a descendant of Shubael ( 1 Chronicles 24:20 ).  </li><li> A Meronothite, herdsman of the asses under David and Solomon ( 1 Chronicles 27:30 ).   </li>
Jehiel	<p>God's living one. </p><li> The father of Gibeon ( 1 Chronicles 9:35 ).  </li><li> One of David's guard ( 1 Chronicles 11:44 ).  </li><li> One of the Levites "of the second degree," appointed to conduct the music on the occasion of the ark's being removed to Jerusalem ( 1 Chronicles 15:18 1 Chronicles 15:20 ).  </li><li> A Hachmonite, a tutor in the family of David toward the close of his reign ( 1 Chronicles 27:32 ).  </li><li> The second of Jehoshaphat's six sons ( 2 Chronicles 21:2 ).  </li><li> One of the Levites of the family of Heman who assisted Hezekiah in his work of reformation ( 2 Chronicles 29:14 ).  </li><li> A "prince" and "ruler of the house of God" who contributed liberally to the renewal of the temple sacrifices under Josiah ( 2 Chronicles 35:8 ).  </li><li> The father of Obadiah ( Ezra 8:9 ).  </li><li> One of the "sons" of Elam ( Ezra 10:26 ).  </li><li> Ezra 10:21 .   </li>
Jehizkiah	<p>Jehovah strengthens, one of the chiefs of Ephraim ( 2 Chronicles 28:12 ).  </p>
Jehoaddan	<p>Jehovah his ornament, the wife of King Jehoash, and mother of King Amaziah ( 2 Kings 14:2 ).  </p>
Jehoahaz	<p>Jehovah his sustainer, or he whom Jehovah holdeth. </p><li> The youngest son of Jehoram, king of Judah ( 2 Chronicles 21:17 ;  2 Chronicles 22:1 2 Chronicles 22:6 2 Chronicles 22:8 2 Chronicles 22:9 ); usually Ahaziah (q.v.).  </li><li> The son and successor of Jehu, king of Israel ( 2 Kings 10:35 ). He reigned seventeen years, and followed the evil ways of the house of Jeroboam. The Syrians, under Hazael and Benhadad, prevailed over him, but were at length driven out of the land by his son Jehoash ( 2 Kings 13:1-9 2 Kings 13:25 ).  </li><li> Josiah's third son, usually called Shallum ( 1 Chronicles 3:15 ). He succeeded his father on the throne, and reigned over Judah for three months ( 2 Kings 23:31 2 Kings 23:34 ). He fell into the idolatrous ways of his predecessors ( 23:32 ), was deposed by Pharaoh-Necho from the throne, and carried away prisoner into Egypt, where he died in captivity ( 2 Kings 23:33 2 Kings 23:34 ;  Jeremiah 22:10-12 ;  2 Chr  36:1-4 ).   </li>
Jehoash	<p>Jehovah-given. </p><li> The son of King Ahaziah. While yet an infant, he was saved from the general massacre of the family by his aunt Jehosheba, and was apparently the only surviving descendant of Solomon ( 2 Chronicles 21:4 2 Chronicles 21:17 ). His uncle, the high priest Jehoiada, brought him forth to public notice when he was eight years of age, and crowned and anointed him king of Judah with the usual ceremonies. Athaliah was taken by surprise when she heard the shout of the people, "Long live the king;" and when she appeared in the temple, Jehoiada commanded her to be led forth to death ( 2 Kings 11:13-20 ). While the high priest lived, Jehoash favoured the worship of God and observed the law; but on his death he fell away into evil courses, and the land was defiled with idolatry. Zechariah, the son and successor of the high priest, was put to death. These evil deeds brought down on the land the judgement of God, and it was oppressed by the Syrian invaders. He is one of the three kings omitted by ( Matthew 1:8 ) in the genealogy of Christ, the other two being Ahaziah and Amaziah. He was buried in the city of David ( 2 Kings 12:21 ). (See JOASH [4].)  </li><li> The son and successor of Jehoahaz, king of Israel ( 2 Kings 14:1 ; comp  12:1 ;  13:10 ). When he ascended the throne the kingdom was suffering from the invasion of the Syrians. Hazael "was cutting Israel short." He tolerated the worship of the golden calves, yet seems to have manifested a character of sincere devotion to the God of his fathers. He held the prophet Elisha in honour, and wept by his bedside when he was dying, addressing him in the words Elisha himself had used when Elijah was carried up into heaven: "O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof." He was afterwards involved in war with Amaziah, the king of Judah ( 2 Chronicles 25:23-24 ), whom he utterly defeated at Beth-shemesh, on the borders of Dan and Philistia, and advancing on Jerusalem, broke down a portion of the wall, and carried away the treasures of the temple and the palace. He soon after died (B.C. 825), and was buried in Samaria ( 2 Kings 14:1-17 2 Kings 14:19 2 Kings 14:20 ). He was succeeded by his son. (See JOASH [5.].)   </li>
Jehohanan	<p>Jehovah-granted, Jeroboam II. </p><li> A Korhite, the head of one of the divisions of the temple porters ( 1 Chronicles 26:3 ).  </li><li> One of Jehoshaphat's "captains" ( 2 Chronicles 17:15 ).  </li><li> The father of Azariah ( 2 Chronicles 28:12 ).  </li><li> The son of Tobiah, an enemy of the Jews ( Nehemiah 6:18 ).  </li><li> Nehemiah 12:42 .  </li><li> Nehemiah 12:13 .   </li>
Jehoiachin	<p>succeeded his father Jehoiakin (B.C. 599) when only eight years of age, and reigned for one hundred days ( 2 Chronicles 36:9 ). He is also called Jeconiah ( Jeremiah 24:1 ;  27:20 , etc.), and Coniah ( 22:24 ;  37:1 ). He was succeeded by his uncle, Mattaniah = Zedekiah (q.v.). He was the last direct heir to the Jewish crown. He was carried captive to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar, along with the flower of the nobility, all the leading men in Jerusalem, and a great body of the general population, some thirteen thousand in all ( 2 Kings 24:12-16 ;  Jeremiah 52:28 ). After an imprisonment of thirty-seven years ( Jeremiah 52:31 Jeremiah 52:33 ), he was liberated by Evil-merodach, and permitted to occupy a place in the king's household and sit at his table, receiving "every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life" ( 52:32-34 ).  </p>
Jehoiada	<p>Jehovah-known. </p><li> The father of Benaiah, who was one of David's chief warriors ( 2 Samuel 8:18 ;  20:23 ).  </li><li> The high priest at the time of Athaliah's usurpation of the throne of Judah. He married Jehosheba, or Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram ( 2 Chronicles 22:11 ), and took an active part along with his wife in the preservation and training of Jehoash when Athaliah slew all the royal family of Judah.  <p> The plans he adopted in replacing Jehoash on the throne of his ancestors are described in  2 Kings 11:2 ;  12:2 ;  2 Chr  22:11 ;  23:24 . He was among the foremost of the benefactors of the kingdom, and at his death was buried in the city of David among the kings of Judah ( 2 Chronicles 24:15 2 Chronicles 24:16 ). He is said to have been one hundred and thirty years old.  </p> </li>
Jehoiakim	<p>he whom Jehovah has set up, the second son of Josiah, and eighteenth king of Judah, which he ruled over for eleven years (B.C. 610-599). His original name was Eliakim (q.v.).  </p><p> On the death of his father his younger brother Jehoahaz (=Shallum,  Jeremiah 22:11 ), who favoured the Chaldeans against the Egyptians, was made king by the people; but the king of Egypt, Pharaoh-necho, invaded the land and deposed Jehoahaz ( 2 Kings 23:33 2 Kings 23:34 ;  Jeremiah 22:10-12 ), setting Eliakim on the throne in his stead, and changing his name to Jehoiakim.  </p><p> After this the king of Egypt took no part in Jewish politics, having been defeated by the Chaldeans at Carchemish ( 2 Kings 24:7 ;  Jeremiah 46:2 ). Palestine was now invaded and conquered by Nebuchadnezzar. Jehoiakim was taken prisoner and carried captive to Babylon ( 2 Chronicles 36:6 2 Chronicles 36:7 ). It was at this time that Daniel also and his three companions were taken captive to Babylon ( Daniel 1:1 Daniel 1:2 ).  </p><p> Nebuchadnezzar reinstated Jehoiakim on his throne, but treated him as a vassal king. In the year after this, Jeremiah caused his prophecies to be read by Baruch in the court of the temple. Jehoiakim, hearing of this, had them also read in the royal palace before himself. The words displeased him, and taking the roll from the hands of Baruch he cut it in pieces and threw it into the fire ( Jeremiah 36:23 ). During his disastrous reign there was a return to the old idolatry and corruption of the days of Manasseh.  </p><p> After three years of subjection to Babylon, Jehoiakim withheld his tribute and threw off the yoke ( 2 Kings 24:1 ), hoping to make himself independent. Nebuchadnezzar sent bands of Chaldeans, Syrians, and Ammonites ( 2 Kings 24:2 ) to chastise his rebellious vassal. They cruelly harassed the whole country (Compare  Jeremiah 49:1-6 ). The king came to a violent death, and his body having been thrown over the wall of Jerusalem, to convince the beseieging army that he was dead, after having been dragged away, was buried beyond the gates of Jerusalem "with the burial of an ass," B.C. 599 ( Jeremiah 22:18 Jeremiah 22:19 ;  36:30 ). Nebuchadnezzar placed his son Jehoiachin on the throne, wishing still to retain the kingdom of Judah as tributary to him.  </p>
Jehoiarib	<p>Jehovah defends, a priest at Jerusalem, head of one of the sacerdotal courses ( 1 Chronicles 9:10 ;  24:7 ). His "course" went up from Babylon after the Exile ( Ezra 2:36-39 ;  Nehemiah 7:39-42 ).  </p>
Jehonadab	<p>Jehovah is liberal; or, whom Jehovah impels. </p><li> A son of Shimeah, and nephew of David. It was he who gave the fatal wicked advice to Amnon, the heir to the throne ( 2 Samuel 13:3-6 ). He was very "subtil," but unprincipled.  </li><li> A son of Rechab, the founder of a tribe who bound themselves by a vow to abstain from wine ( Jeremiah 35:6-19 ). There were different settlements of Rechabites ( Judges 1:16 ;  4:11 ;  1 Chronicles 2:55 ). (See RECHABITE .) His interview and alliance with Jehu are mentioned in  2 Kings 10:15-23 . He went with Jehu in his chariot to Samaria.   </li>
Jehonathan	<p>whom Jehovah gave. </p><li> One of the stewards of David's store-houses ( 1 Chronicles 27:25 ).  </li><li> A Levite who taught the law to the people of Judah ( 2 Chronicles 17:8 ).  </li><li> Nehemiah 12:18 .   </li>
Jehoram	<p>Jehovah-exalted. </p><li> Son of Toi, king of Hamath, sent by his father to congratulate David on the occasion of his victory over Hadadezer ( 2 Samuel 8:10 ).  </li><li> A Levite of the family of Gershom ( 1 Chronicles 26:25 ).  </li><li> A priest sent by Jehoshaphat to instructruct the people in Judah ( 2 Chronicles 17:8 ).  </li><li> The son of Ahab and Jezebel, and successor to his brother Ahaziah on the throne of Israel. He reigned twelve years, B.C. 896-884 ( 2 Kings 1:17 ;  3:1 ). His first work was to reduce to subjection the Moabites, who had asserted their independence in the reign of his brother. Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, assisted Jehoram in this effort. He was further helped by his ally the king of Edom. Elisha went forth with the confederated army ( 2 Kings 3:1-19 ), and at the solicitation of Jehoshaphat encouraged the army with the assurance from the Lord of a speedy victory. The Moabites under Mesha their king were utterly routed and their cities destroyed. At Kir-haraseth Mesha made a final stand. The Israelites refrained from pressing their victory further, and returned to their own land.  <p> Elisha afterwards again befriended Jehoram when a war broke out between the Syrians and Israel, and in a remarkable way brought that war to a bloodless close ( 2 Kings 6:23 ). But Jehoram, becoming confident in his own power, sank into idolatry, and brought upon himself and his land another Syrian invasion, which led to great suffering and distress in Samaria ( 2 Kings 6:24-33 ). By a remarkable providential interposition the city was saved from utter destruction, and the Syrians were put to flight ( 2 Kings 7:6-15 ).  </p><p> Jehoram was wounded in a battle with the Syrians at Ramah, and obliged to return to Jezreel ( 2 Kings 8:29 ;  2 Kings 9:14 2 Kings 9:15 ), and soon after the army proclaimed their leader Jehu king of Israel, and revolted from their allegiance to Jehoram ( 2 Kings 9 ). Jehoram was pierced by an arrow from Jehu's bow on the piece of ground at Jezreel which Ahab had taken from Naboth, and there he died ( 2 Kings 9:21-29 ).  </p></li><li> The eldest son and successor of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah. He reigned eight years (B.C. 892-885) alone as king of Judah, having been previously for some years associated with his father ( 2 Chronicles 21:5 2 Chronicles 21:20 ;  2 Kings  8:16 ). His wife was Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel. His daughter Jehosheba was married to the high priest Jehoiada. He sank into gross idolatry, and brought upon himself and his kingdom the anger of Jehovah. The Edomites revolted from under his yoke, and the Philistines and the Arabians and Cushites invaded the land, and carried away great spoil, along with Jehoram's wives and all his children, except Ahaziah. He died a painful death from a fearful malady, and was refused a place in the sepulchre of the kings ( 2 Kings 8:16-24 ;  2 Chr.  21 ).   </li>
Jehoshaphat	<p>Jehovah-judged. </p><li> One of David's body-guard ( 1 Chronicles 11:43 ).  </li><li> One of the priests who accompanied the removal of the ark to Jerusalem ( 1 Chronicles 15:24 ).  </li><li> Son of Ahilud, "recorder" or annalist under David and Solomon ( 2 Samuel 8:16 ), a state officer of high rank, chancellor or vizier of the kingdom.  </li><li> Solomon's purveyor in Issachar ( 1 Kings 4:17 ).  </li><li> The son and successor of Asa, king of Judah. After fortifying his kingdom against Israel ( 2 Chronicles 17:1 2 Chronicles 17:2 ), he set himself to cleanse the land of idolatry ( 1 Kings 22:43 ). In the third year of his reign he sent out priests and Levites over the land to instruct the people in the law ( 2 Chronicles 17:7-9 ). He enjoyed a great measure of peace and prosperity, the blessing of God resting on the people "in their basket and their store."  <p> The great mistake of his reign was his entering into an alliance with Ahab, the king of Israel, which involved him in much disgrace, and brought disaster on his kingdom ( 1 Kings 22:1-33 ). Escaping from the bloody battle of Ramoth-gilead, the prophet Jehu ( 2 Chronicles 19:1-3 ) reproached him for the course he had been pursuing, whereupon he entered with rigour on his former course of opposition to all idolatry, and of deepening interest in the worship of God and in the righteous government of the people ( 2 Chronicles 19:4-11 ).  </p><p> Again he entered into an alliance with Ahaziah, the king of Israel, for the purpose of carrying on maritime commerce with Ophir. But the fleet that was then equipped at Ezion-gaber was speedily wrecked. A new fleet was fitted out without the co-operation of the king of Israel, and although it was successful, the trade was not prosecuted ( 2 Chronicles 20:35-37 ;  1 Kings 22:48-49 ).  </p><p> He subsequently joined Jehoram, king of Israel, in a war against the Moabites, who were under tribute to Israel. This war was successful. The Moabites were subdued; but the dreadful act of Mesha in offering his own son a sacrifice on the walls of Kir-haresheth in the sight of the armies of Israel filled him with horror, and he withdrew and returned to his own land ( 2 Kings 3:4-27 ).  </p><p> The last most notable event of his reign was that recorded in  2 Chronicles 20 . The Moabites formed a great and powerful confederacy with the surrounding nations, and came against Jehoshaphat. The allied forces were encamped at Engedi. The king and his people were filled with alarm, and betook themselves to God in prayer. The king prayed in the court of the temple, "O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us." Amid the silence that followed, the voice of Jahaziel the Levite was heard announcing that on the morrow all this great host would be overthrown. So it was, for they quarrelled among themselves, and slew one another, leaving to the people of Judah only to gather the rich spoils of the slain. This was recognized as a great deliverance wrought for them by God (B.C. 890). Soon after this Jehoshaphat died, after a reign of twenty-five years, being sixty years of age, and was succeeded by his son Jehoram ( 1 Kings 22:50 ). He had this testimony, that "he sought the Lord with all his heart" ( 2 Chronicles 22:9 ). The kingdom of Judah was never more prosperous than under his reign.  </p></li><li> The son of Nimshi, and father of Jehu, king of Israel ( 2 Kings 9:2 2 Kings 9:14 ).   </li>
Jehoshaphat, Valley of	<p>mentioned in Scripture only in  Joel 3:2 Joel 3:12 . This is the name given in modern times to the valley between Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives, and the Kidron flows through it. Here Jehoshaphat overthrew the confederated enemies of Israel ( Psalms 83:6-8 ); and in this valley also God was to overthrow the Tyrians, Zidonians, etc. ( Joel 3:4 Joel 3:19 ), with an utter overthrow. This has been fulfilled; but Joel speaks of the final conflict, when God would destroy all Jerusalem's enemies, of whom Tyre and Zidon, etc., were types. The "valley of Jehoshaphat" may therefore be simply regarded as a general term for the theatre of God's final judgments on the enemies of Israel.  </p><p> This valley has from ancient times been used by the Jews as a burial-ground. It is all over paved with flat stones as tombstones, bearing on them Hebrew inscriptions. </p>
Jehosheba	<p>Jehovah-swearing, the daughter of Jehoram, the king of Israel. She is called Jehoshabeath in  2 Chronicles 22:11 . She was the only princess of the royal house who was married to a high priest, Jehoiada ( 2 Chronicles 22:11 ).  </p>
Jehovah	<p>the special and significant name (not merely an appellative title such as Lord [adonai]) by which God revealed himself to the ancient Hebrews ( Exodus 6:2 Exodus 6:3 ). This name, the Tetragrammaton of the Greeks, was held by the later Jews to be so sacred that it was never pronounced except by the high priest on the great Day of Atonement, when he entered into the most holy place. Whenever this name occurred in the sacred books they pronounced it, as they still do, "Adonai" (i.e., Lord), thus using another word in its stead. The Massorets gave to it the vowel-points appropriate to this word. This Jewish practice was founded on a false interpretation of  Leviticus 24:16 . The meaning of the word appears from  Exodus 3:14  to be "the unchanging, eternal, self-existent God," the "I am that I am," a convenant-keeping God. (Compare  Malachi 3:6 ;  Hosea 12:5 ;  Revelation 1:4 Revelation 1:8 .)  </p><p> The Hebrew name "Jehovah" is generally translated in the Authorized Version (and the Revised Version has not departed from this rule) by the word LORD printed in small capitals, to distinguish it from the rendering of the Hebrew <i> Adonai</i> and the Greek <i> Kurios</i> , which are also rendered Lord, but printed in the usual type. The Hebrew word is translated "Jehovah" only in  Exodus 6:3 ;  Psalms 83:18 ;  Isaiah 12:2 ;  26:4 , and in the compound names mentioned below.  </p><p> It is worthy of notice that this name is never used in the LXX., the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Apocrypha, or in the New Testament. It is found, however, on the "Moabite stone" (q.v.), and consequently it must have been in the days of Mesba so commonly pronounced by the Hebrews as to be familiar to their heathen neighbours. </p>
Jehovah-jireh	<p>Jehovah will see; i.e., will provide, the name given by Abraham to the scene of his offering up the ram which was caught in the thicket on Mount Moriah. The expression used in  Genesis 22:14 , "in the mount of the Lord it shall be seen," has been regarded as equivalent to the saying, "Man's extremity is God's opportunity."  </p>
Jehovah-nissi	<p>Jehovah my banner, the title given by Moses to the altar which he erected on the hill on the top of which he stood with uplifted hands while Israel prevailed over their enemies the Amalekites ( Exodus 17:15 ).  </p>
Jehovah-shalom	<p>Jehovah send peace, the name which Gideon gave to the altar he erected on the spot at Ophrah where the angel appeared to him ( Judges 6:24 ).  </p>
Jehovah-shammah	<p>Jehovah is there, the symbolical title given by Ezekiel to Jerusalem, which was seen by him in vision ( Ezekiel 48:35 ). It was a type of the gospel Church.  </p>
Jehovah-tsidkenu	<p>Jehovah our rightousness, rendered in the Authorized Version, "The LORD our righteousness," a title given to the Messiah ( Jeremiah 23:6 , marg.), and also to Jerusalem ( 33:16 , marg.).  </p>
Jehozabad	<p>Jehovah-given. </p><li> The son of Obed-edom ( 1 Chronicles 26:4 ), one of the Levite porters.  </li><li> The son of Shomer, one of the two conspirators who put king Jehoash to death in Millo in Jerusalem ( 2 Kings 12:21 ).  </li><li> 2 Chronicles 17:18 .   </li>
Jehozadak	<p>Jehovah-justified, the son of the high priest Seraiah at the time of the Babylonian exile ( 1 Chronicles 6:14 1 Chronicles 6:15 ). He was carried into captivity by Nebuchadnezzar, and probably died in Babylon. He was the father of Jeshua, or Joshua, who returned with Zerubbabel.  </p>
Jehu	<p>Jehovah is he. </p><li> The son of Obed, and father of Azariah ( 1 Chronicles 2:38 ).  </li><li> One of the Benjamite slingers that joined David at Ziklag ( 1 Chronicles 12:3 ).  </li><li> The son of Hanani, a prophet of Judah ( 1 Kings 16:1 1 Kings 16:7 ;  2 Chr  19:2 ;  20:34 ), who pronounced the sentence of God against Baasha, the king of Israel.  </li><li> King of Israel, the son of Jehoshaphat ( 2 Kings 9:2 ), and grandson of Nimshi. The story of his exaltation to the throne is deeply interesting. During the progress of a war against the Syrians, who were becoming more and more troublesome to Israel, in a battle at Ramoth-gilead Jehoram, the king of Israel, had been wounded; and leaving his army there, had returned to Jezreel, whither his ally, Ahaziah, king of Judah, had also gone on a visit of sympathy with him ( 2 Kings 8:28 2 Kings 8:29 ). The commanders, being left in charge of the conduct of the war, met in council; and while engaged in their deliberations, a messenger from Elisha appeared in the camp, and taking Jehu from the council, led him into a secret chamber, and there anointed him king over Israel, and immediately retired and disappeared ( 2 Kings 9:5 2 Kings 9:6 ). On being interrogated by his companions as to the object of this mysterious visitor, he informed them of what had been done, when immediately, with the utmost enthusiasm, they blew their trumpets and proclaimed him king ( 2 Kings 9:11-14 ). He then with a chosen band set forth with all speed to Jezreel, where, with his own hand, he slew Jehoram, shooting him through the heart with an arrow ( 9:24 ). The king of Judah, when trying to escape, was fatally wounded by one of Jehu's soldiers at Beth-gan. On entering the city, Jehu commanded the eunchs of the royal palace to cast down Jezebel into the street, where her mangled body was trodden under foot by the horses. Jehu was now master of Jezreel, whence he communicated with the persons in authority in Samaria the capital, commanding them to appear before him on the morrow with the heads of all the royal princes of Samaria. Accordingly on the morrow seventy heads were piled up in two heaps at his gate. At "the shearing-house" ( 2 Kings 10:12-14 ) other forty-two connected with the house of Ahab were put to death ( 2 Kings 10:14 ). As Jehu rode on toward Samaria, he met Jehonadab (q.v.), whom he took into his chariot, and they entered the capital together. By a cunning stratagem he cut off all the worshippers of Baal found in Samaria ( 2 Kings 10:19-25 ), and destroyed the temple of the idol ( 2 Kings 10:27 ).  <p> Notwithstanding all this apparent zeal for the worship of Jehovah, Jehu yet tolerated the worship of the golden calves at Dan and Bethel. For this the divine displeasure rested upon him, and his kingdom suffered disaster in war with the Syrians ( 2 Kings 10:29-33 ). He died after a reign of twenty-eight years (B.C. 884-856), and was buried in Samaria ( 10:34-36 ). "He was one of those decisive, terrible, and ambitious, yet prudent, calculating, and passionless men whom God from time to time raises up to change the fate of empires and execute his judgments on the earth." He was the first Jewish king who came in contact with the Assyrian power in the time of Shalmaneser II.  </p> </li>
Jehucal	<p>able, the son of Shelemiah. He is also called Jucal ( Jeremiah 38:1 ). He was one of the two persons whom Zedekiah sent to request the prophet Jeremiah to pray for the kingdom ( Jeremiah 37:3 ) during the time of its final siege by Nebuchadnezzar. He was accompanied by Zephaniah (q.v.).  </p>
Jehudi	<p>a Jew, son of Nethaniah. He was sent by the princes to invite Baruch to read Jeremiah's roll to them ( Jeremiah 36:14 Jeremiah 36:21 ).  </p>
Jeiel	<p>snatched away by God. </p><li> A descendant of Benjamin ( 1 Chronicles 9:35 ;  8:29 ).  </li><li> One of the Levites who took part in praising God on the removal of the ark to Jerusalem ( 1 Chronicles 16:5 ).  </li><li> 2 Chronicles 29:13 . A Levite of the sons of Asaph.  </li><li> 2 Chronicles 26:11 . A scribe.  </li><li> 1 Chronicles 5:7 . A Reubenite chief.  </li><li> One of the chief Levites, who made an offering for the restoration of the Passover by Josiah ( 2 Chronicles 35:9 ).  </li><li> Ezra 8:13 .  </li><li> Ezra 10:43 .   </li>
Jemima	<p>dove, the eldest of Job's three daughters born after his time of trial ( Job 42:14 ).  </p>
Jephthah	<p>whom God sets free, or the breaker through, a "mighty man of valour" who delivered Israel from the oppression of the Ammonites ( Judges 11:1-33 ), and judged Israel six years ( 12:7 ). He has been described as "a wild, daring, Gilead mountaineer, a sort of warrior Elijah." After forty-five years of comparative quiet Israel again apostatized, and in "process of time the children of Ammon made war against Israel" ( 11:5 ). In their distress the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob, to which he had fled when driven out wrongfully by his brothers from his father's inheritance (2), and the people made him their head and captain. The "elders of Gilead" in their extremity summoned him to their aid, and he at once undertook the conduct of the war against Ammon. Twice he sent an embassy to the king of Ammon, but in vain. War was inevitable. The people obeyed his summons, and "the spirit of the Lord came upon him." Before engaging in war he vowed that if successful he would offer as a "burnt-offering" whatever would come out of the door of his house first to meet him on his return. The defeat of the Ammonites was complete. "He smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards [Heb. 'Abel Keramim], with a very great slaughter" ( Judges 11:33 ). The men of Ephraim regarded themselves as insulted in not having been called by Jephthah to go with him to war against Ammon. This led to a war between the men of Gilead and Ephraim ( 12:4 ), in which many of the Ephraimites perished. (See SHIBBOLETH .) "Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead" (7).  </p>
Jephthahs vow	<p>( Judges 11:30 Judges 11:31 ). After a crushing defeat of the Ammonites, Jephthah returned to his own house, and the first to welcome him was his own daughter. This was a terrible blow to the victor, and in his despair he cried out, "Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low...I have opened my mouth unto the Lord, and cannot go back." With singular nobleness of spirit she answered, "Do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth." She only asked two months to bewail her maidenhood with her companions upon the mountains. She utters no reproach against her father's rashness, and is content to yield her life since her father has returned a conqueror. But was it so? Did Jephthah offer up his daughter as a "burnt-offering"? This question has been much debated, and there are many able commentators who argue that such a sacrifice was actually offered. We are constrained, however, by a consideration of Jephthah's known piety as a true worshipper of Jehovah, his evident acquaintance with the law of Moses, to which such sacrifices were abhorrent ( Leviticus 18:21 ;  20:2-5 ;  Deuteronomy 12:31 ), and the place he holds in the roll of the heroes of the faith in the Epistle to the ( Hebrews 11:32 ), to conclude that she was only doomed to a life of perpetual celibacy.  </p>
Jephunneh	<p>nimble, or a beholder. </p><li> The father of Caleb, who was Joshua's companion in exploring Canaan ( Numbers 13:6 ), a Kenezite ( Joshua 14:14 ). </li><li> One of the descendants of Asher ( 1 Chronicles 7:38 ).   </li>
Jerahmeel	<p>loving God. </p><li> The son of Hezron, the brother of Caleb ( 1 Chronicles 2:9 1 Chronicles 2:25 1 Chronicles 2:26 , etc.).  </li><li> The son of Kish, a Levite ( 1 Chronicles 24:29 ).  </li><li> Son of Hammelech ( Jeremiah 36:26 ).   </li>
Jeremiah	<p>raised up or appointed by Jehovah. </p><li> A Gadite who joined David in the wilderness ( 1 Chronicles 12:10 ).  </li><li> A Gadite warrior ( 1 Chronicles 12:13 ).  </li><li> A Benjamite slinger who joined David at Ziklag ( 1 Chronicles 12:4 ).  </li><li> One of the chiefs of the tribe of Manasseh on the east of Jordan ( 1 Chronicles 5:24 ).  </li><li> The father of Hamutal ( 2 Kings 23:31 ), the wife of Josiah.  </li><li> One of the "greater prophets" of the Old Testament, son of Hilkiah (q.v.), a priest of Anathoth ( Jeremiah 1:1 ;  32:6 ). He was called to the prophetical office when still young ( 1:6 ), in the thirteenth year of Josiah (B.C. 628). He left his native place, and went to reside in Jerusalem, where he greatly assisted Josiah in his work of reformation ( 2 Kings 23:1-25 ). The death of this pious king was bewailed by the prophet as a national calamity ( 2 Chronicles 35:25 ).  <p> During the three years of the reign of Jehoahaz we find no reference to Jeremiah, but in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the enmity of the people against him broke out in bitter persecution, and he was placed apparently under restraint ( Jeremiah 36:5 ). In the fourth year of Jehoiakim he was commanded to write the predictions given to him, and to read them to the people on the fast-day. This was done by Baruch his servant in his stead, and produced much public excitement. The roll was read to the king. In his recklessness he seized the roll, and cut it to pieces, and cast it into the fire, and ordered both Baruch and Jeremiah to be apprehended. Jeremiah procured another roll, and wrote in it the words of the roll the king had destroyed, and "many like words" besides ( Jeremiah 36:32 ).  </p><p> He remained in Jerusalem, uttering from time to time his words of warning, but without effect. He was there when Nebuchadnezzar besieged the city ( Jeremiah 37:4 Jeremiah 37:5 ), B.C. 589. The rumour of the approach of the Egyptians to aid the Jews in this crisis induced the Chaldeans to withdraw and return to their own land. This, however, was only for a time. The prophet, in answer to his prayer, received a message from God announcing that the Chaldeans would come again and take the city, and burn it with fire ( Jeremiah 37:7 Jeremiah 37:8 ). The princes, in their anger at such a message by Jeremiah, cast him into prison ( (37:15-38:13). ). He was still in confinement when the city was taken (B.C. 588). The Chaldeans released him, and showed him great kindness, allowing him to choose the place of his residence. He accordingly went to Mizpah with Gedaliah, who had been made governor of Judea. Johanan succeeded Gedaliah, and refusing to listen to Jeremiah's counsels, went down into Egypt, taking Jeremiah and Baruch with him ( Jeremiah 43:6 ). There probably the prophet spent the remainder of his life, in vain seeking still to turn the people to the Lord, from whom they had so long revolted (44). He lived till the reign of Evil-Merodach, son of Nebuchadnezzar, and must have been about ninety years of age at his death. We have no authentic record of his death. He may have died at Tahpanhes, or, according to a tradition, may have gone to Babylon with the army of Nebuchadnezzar; but of this there is nothing certain.  </p> </li>
Jeremiah, Book of	<p>consists of twenty-three separate and independent sections, arranged in five books. I. The introduction, ch. 1. II. Reproofs of the sins of the Jews, consisting of seven sections, </p><li> ch. 2; </li><li> ch. 3-6; </li><li> ch. 7-10; </li><li> ch. 11-13; </li><li> ch.  14-17:18; ; </li><li> ch 17:19-ch. 20; </li><li> ch. 21-24.

IV. Two sections picturing the hopes of better times, </li><li> ch. 30,31; </li><li> ch. 32,33; to which is added an historical appendix in three sections, </li><li> ch.  34:1-7 ; </li><li> ch  34:8-22 ; </li><li> ch. 35. V. The conclusion, in two sections, </li><li> ch. 36; </li><li> ch. 45.  <p> In Egypt, after an interval, Jeremiah is supposed to have added three sections, viz., ch. 37-39; 40-43; and 44.  </p><p> The principal Messianic prophecies are found in  23:1-8 ;  31:31-40 ; and  33:14-26 .  </p><p> Jeremiah's prophecies are noted for the frequent repetitions found in them of the same words and phrases and imagery. They cover the period of about 30 years. They are not recorded in the order of time. When and under what circumstances this book assumed its present form we know not.  </p><p> The LXX. Version of this book is, in its arrangement and in other particulars, singularly at variance with the original. The LXX. omits  10:6-8 ;  27:19-22 ;  29:16-20 ;  33:14-26 ;  39:4-13 ;  Jeremiah 52:2 Jeremiah 52:3 Jeremiah 52:15 Jeremiah 52:28-30 , etc. About 2,700 words in all of the original are omitted. These omissions, etc., are capricious and arbitrary, and render the version unreliable.  </p> </li>
Kabzeel	<p>gathering of God, a city in the extreme south of Judah, near to Idumaea ( Joshua 15:21 ), the birthplace of Benaiah, one of David's chief warriors ( 2 Samuel 23:20 ;  1 Chronicles 11:22 ). It was called also Jekabzeel ( Nehemiah 11:25 ), after the Captivity.  </p>
Kadesh	<p>holy, or Kadesh-Barnea, sacred desert of wandering, a place on the south-eastern border of Palestine, about 165 miles from Horeb. It lay in the "wilderness" or "desert of Zin" ( Genesis 14:7 ;  Numbers 13:3-26 ;  14:29-33 ;  20:1 ;  27:14 ), on the border of Edom ( 20:16 ). From this place, in compliance with the desire of the people, Moses sent forth "twelve spies" to spy the land. After examining it in all its districts, the spies brought back an evil report, Joshua and Caleb alone giving a good report of the land ( 13:18-31 ). Influenced by the discouraging report, the people abandoned all hope of entering into the Promised Land. They remained a considerable time at Kadesh. (See HORMAH;  KORAH .) Because of their unbelief, they were condemned by God to wander for thirty-eight years in the wilderness. They took their journey from Kadesh into the deserts of Paran, "by way of the Red Sea" ( Deuteronomy 2:1 ). (One theory is that during these thirty-eight years they remained in and about Kadesh.)  </p><p> At the end of these years of wanderings, the tribes were a second time gathered together at Kadesh. During their stay here at this time Miriam died and was buried. Here the people murmured for want of water, as their forefathers had done formerly at Rephidim; and Moses, irritated by their chidings, "with his rod smote the rock twice," instead of "speaking to the rock before their eyes," as the Lord had commanded him (Compare  Numbers 27:14 ;  Deuteronomy 9:23 ;  Psalms 106:32 Psalms 106:33 ). Because of this act of his, in which Aaron too was involved, neither of them was to be permitted to set foot within the Promised Land ( Numbers 20:12 Numbers 20:24 ). The king of Edom would not permit them to pass on through his territory, and therefore they commenced an eastward march, and "came unto Mount Hor" ( 20:22 ).  </p><p> This place has been identified with 'Ain el-Kadeis, about 12 miles east-south-east of Beersheba. (See SPIES .) </p>
Kadesh	<p>the sacred city of the Hittites, on the left bank of the Orontes, about 4 miles south of the Lake of Homs. It is identified with the great mound Tell Neby Mendeh, some 50 to 100 feet high, and 400 yards long. On the ruins of the temple of Karnak, in Egypt, has been found an inscription recording the capture of this city by Rameses II. (See PHARAOH .) Here the sculptor "has chiselled in deep work on the stone, with a bold execution of the several parts, the procession of the warriors, the battle before Kadesh, the storming of the fortress, the overthrow of the enemy, and the camp life of the Egyptians." (See HITTITES .) </p>
Kadmiel	<p>before God; i.e., his servant, one of the Levites who returned with Zerubbabel from the Captivity ( Nehemiah 9:4 ;  10:9 ;  12:8 ).  </p>
Kadmonites	<p>Orientals, the name of a Canaanitish tribe which inhabited the north-eastern part of Palestine in the time of Abraham ( Genesis 15:19 ). Probably they were identical with the "children of the east," who inhabited the country between Palestine and the Euphrates.  </p>
Kanah	<p>reedy; brook of reeds. </p><li> A stream forming the boundary between Ephraim and Manasseh, from the Mediterranean eastward to Tappuah ( Joshua 16:8 ). It has been identified with the sedgy streams that constitute the Wady Talaik, which enters the sea between Joppa and Caesarea. Others identify it with the river' Aujeh.  </li><li> A town in the north of Asher ( Joshua 19:28 ). It has been identified with 'Ain-Kana, a village on the brow of a valley some 7 miles south-east of Tyre. About a mile north of this place are many colossal ruins strown about. And in the side of a neighbouring ravine are figures of men, women, and children cut in the face of the rock. These are supposed to be of Phoenician origin.   </li>
Kareah	<p>bald, the father of Johanan and Jonathan, who for a time were loyal to Gedaliah, the Babylonian governor of Jerusalem ( Jeremiah 40:8 Jeremiah 40:13 Jeremiah 40:15 Jeremiah 40:16 ).  </p>
Karkaa	<p>a floor; bottom, a place between Adar and Azmon, about midway between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea ( Joshua 15:3 ).  </p>
Karkor	<p>foundation, a place in the open desert wastes on the east of Jordan ( Judges 8:10 ), not far beyond Succoth and Penuel, to the south. Here Gideon overtook and routed a fugitive band of Midianites under Zeba and Zalmunna, whom he took captive.  </p>
Kartah	<p>city, a town in the tribe of Zebulun assigned to the Levites of the family of Merari ( Joshua 21:34 ). It is identical with Kattath ( 19:15 ), and perhaps also with Kitron ( Judges 1:30 ).  </p>
Kartan	<p>double city, a town of Naphali, assigned to the Gershonite Levites, and one of the cities of refuge ( Joshua 21:32 ). It was probably near the north-western shore of the Sea of Tiberias, identical with the ruined village el-Katanah.  </p>
Kattath	<p>( Joshua 19:15 ), a town of Asher, has been identified with Kana el Jelil. (See CANA .) </p>
Kedar	<p>dark-skinned, the second son of Ishmael ( Genesis 25:13 ).  </p><p> It is the name for the nomadic tribes of Arabs, the Bedouins generally ( Isaiah 21:16 ;  42:11 ;  60:7 ;  Jeremiah 2:10 ;  Ezekiel 27:21 ), who dwelt in the north-west of Arabia. They lived in black hair-tents (Cant  1:5 ). To "dwell in the tents of Kedar" was to be cut off from the worship of the true God ( Psalms 120:5 ). The Kedarites suffered at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar ( Jeremiah 49:28 Jeremiah 49:29 ).  </p>
Kedemah	<p>eastward, the last-named of the sons of Ishmael ( Genesis 25:15 ).  </p>
Kedemoth	<p>beginnings; easternmost, a city of Reuben, assigned to the Levites of the family of Merari ( Joshua 13:18 ). It lay not far north-east of Dibon-gad, east of the Dead Sea.  </p>
Kedesh	<p>sanctuary. </p><li> A place in the extreme south of Judah ( Joshua 15:23 ). Probably the same as Kadesh-barnea (q.v.).  </li><li> A city of Issachar ( 1 Chronicles 6:72 ). Possibly Tell Abu Kadeis, near Lejjun.  </li><li> A "fenced city" of Naphtali, one of the cities of refuge ( Joshua 19:37 ;  Judges 4:6 ). It was assigned to the Gershonite Levites ( Joshua 21:32 ). It was originally a Canaanite royal city ( Joshua 12:22 ), and was the residence of Barak ( Judges 4:6 ); and here he and Deborah assembled the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali before the commencement of the conflict with Sisera in the plain of Esdraelon, "for Jehovah among the mighty" (9,10). In the reign of Pekah it was taken by Tiglath-Pileser ( 2 Kings 15:29 ). It was situated near the "plain" (rather "the oak") of Zaanaim, and has been identified with the modern Kedes, on the hills fully four miles north-west of Lake El Huleh.  <p> It has been supposed by some that the Kedesh of the narrative, where Barak assembled his troops, was not the place in Upper Galilee so named, which was 30 miles distant from the plain of Esdraelon, but Kedish, on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, 12 miles from Tabor.  </p> </li>
Kedron	<p>the valley, now quite narrow, between the Mount of Olives and Mount Moriah. The upper part of it is called the Valley of Jehoshaphat. The LXX., in  1 Kings 15:13 , translate "of the cedar." The word means "black," and may refer to the colour of the water or the gloom of the ravine, or the black green of the cedars which grew there.  John 18:1 , "Cedron," only here in New Testament. (See KIDRON .) </p>
Kehelathah	<p>assembly, one of the stations of the Israelites in the desert ( Numbers 33:22 Numbers 33:23 ).  </p>
Keilah	<p>citadel, a city in the lowlands of Judah ( Joshua 15:44 ). David rescued it from the attack of the Philistines ( 1 Samuel 23:1-8 ); but the inhabitants proving unfaithful to him, in that they sought to deliver him up to Saul (13), he and his men "departed from Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go." They fled to the hill Hareth, about 3 miles to the east, and thence through Hebron to Ziph (q.v.). "And David was in the wilderness of Ziph, in a wood" ( 1 Samuel 23:15 ). Here Jonathan sought him out, "and strengthened his hand in God." This was the last interview between David and Jonathan ( 23:16-18 ). It is the modern Khurbet Kila. Others identify it with Khuweilfeh, between Beit Jibrin (Eleutheropolis) and Beersheba, mentioned in the Amarna tablets.  </p>
Kelita	<p>dwarf, a Levite who assisted Ezra in expounding the law to the people ( Nehemiah 8:7 ;  10:10 ).  </p>
Kemuel	<p>helper of God, or assembly of God. </p><li> The third son of Nahor ( Genesis 22:21 ).  </li><li> Son of Shiphtan, appointed on behalf of the tribe of Ephraim to partition the land of Canaan ( Numbers 34:24 ).  </li><li> A Levite ( 1 Chronicles 27:17 ).   </li>
Kenath	<p>possession, a city of Gilead. It was captured by Nobah, who called it by his own name ( Numbers 32:42 ). It has been identified with Kunawat, on the slopes of Jebel Hauran (Mount Bashan), 60 miles east from the south end of the Sea of Galilee.  </p>
Kenaz	<p>hunter. </p><li> One of the sons of Eliphaz, the son of Esau. He became the chief of an Edomitish tribe ( Genesis 36:11 Genesis 36:15 Genesis 36:42 ).  </li><li> Caleb's younger brother, and father of Othniel ( Joshua 15:17 ), whose family was of importance in Israel down to the time of David ( 1 Chronicles 27:15 ). Some think that Othniel (Judg.  1:13 ), and not Kenaz, was Caleb's brother.  </li><li> Caleb's grandson ( 1 Chronicles 4:15 ).   </li>
Kenites	<p>smiths, the name of a tribe inhabiting the desert lying between southern Palestine and the mountains of Sinai. Jethro was of this tribe ( Judges 1:16 ). He is called a "Midianite" ( Numbers 10:29 ), and hence it is concluded that the Midianites and the Kenites were the same tribe. They were wandering smiths, "the gipsies and travelling tinkers of the old Oriental world. They formed an important guild in an age when the art of metallurgy was confined to a few" (Sayce's Races, etc.). They showed kindness to Israel in their journey through the wilderness. They accompanied them in their march as far as Jericho ( Judges 1:16 ), and then returned to their old haunts among the Amalekites, in the desert to the south of Judah. They sustained afterwards friendly relations with the Israelites when settled in Canaan ( Judges 4:11 Judges 4:17-21 ;  1 Samuel 27:10 ;  30:29 ). The Rechabites belonged to this tribe ( 1 Chronicles 2:55 ) and in the days of ( Jeremiah 35:7-10 ) are referred to as following their nomad habits. Saul bade them depart from the Amalekites ( 1 Samuel 15:6 ) when, in obedience to the divine commission, he was about to "smite Amalek." And his reason is, "for ye showed kindness to all the children of Israel when they came up out of Egypt." Thus "God is not unrighteous to forget the kindnesses shown to his people; but they shall be remembered another day, at the farthest in the great day, and recompensed in the resurrection of the just" (M. Henry's Commentary). They are mentioned for the last time in Scripture in  1 Samuel 27:10 ; comp  30:20 .  </p>
Kenizzite	<p></p><li> The name of a tribe referred to in the covenant God made with Abraham ( Genesis 15:19 ). They are not mentioned among the original inhabitants of Canaan ( Exodus 3:8 ;  Joshua 3:10 ), and probably they inhabited some part of Arabia, in the confines of Syria.  </li><li> A designation given to Caleb (RSV,  Numbers 32:12 ; A.V., Kenezite).   </li>
Kerchief	<p>mentioned only  Ezekiel 13:18 Ezekiel 13:21 , as an article of apparel or ornament applied to the head of the idolatrous women of Israel. The precise meaning of the word is uncertain. It appears to have been a long loose shawl, such as Oriental women wrap themselves in ( Ruth 3:15 ;  Isaiah 3:22 ). Some think that it was a long veil or head-dress, denoting by its form the position of those who wore it.  </p>
Keren-happuch	<p>horn of the face-paint = cosmetic-box, the name of Job's third daughter ( Job 42:14 ), born after prosperity had returned to him.  </p>
Kerioth	<p>cities. </p><li> A town in the south of Judah ( Joshua 15:25 ). Judas the traitor was probably a native of this place, and hence his name Iscariot. It has been identified with the ruins of el-Kureitein, about 10 miles south of Hebron. (See HAZOR [4]).  </li><li> A city of Moab ( Jeremiah 48:24 Jeremiah 48:41 ), called Kirioth ( Amos 2:2 ).   </li>
Kesitah	<p>( Genesis 33:19 , RSV, marg., a Hebrew word, rendered, A.V., pl. "pieces of money," marg., "lambs;"  Joshua 24:32 , "pieces of silver;"  Job 42:11 , "piece of money"). The kesitah was probably a piece of money of a particular weight, cast in the form of a lamb. The monuments of Egypt show that such weights were used. (See PIECES .) </p>
Kettle	<p>a large pot for cooking. The same Hebrew word (dud, "boiling") is rendered also "pot" ( Psalms 81:6 ), "caldron" ( 2 Chronicles 35:13 ), "basket" ( Jeremiah 24:2 ). It was used for preparing the peace-offerings ( 1 Samuel 2:13 1 Samuel 2:14 ).  </p>
Keturah	<p>incense, the wife of Abraham, whom he married probably after Sarah's death ( Genesis 25:1-6 ), by whom he had six sons, whom he sent away into the east country. Her nationality is unknown. She is styled "Abraham's concubine" ( 1 Chronicles 1:32 ). Through the offshoots of the Keturah line Abraham became the "father of many nations."  </p>
Key	<p>frequently mentioned in Scripture. It is called in Hebrew <i> maphteah</i> , i.e., the opener ( Judges 3:25 ); and in the Greek New Testament <i> kleis</i> , from its use in shutting ( Matthew 16:19 ;  Luke 11:52 ;  Revelation 1:18 , etc.). Figures of ancient Egyptian keys are frequently found on the monuments, also of Assyrian locks and keys of wood, and of a large size (Compare  Isaiah 22:22 ).  </p><p> The word is used figuratively of power or authority or office ( Isaiah 22:22 ;  Revelation 3:7 ;  Revelation 1:8 ; comp  9:1 ;  20:1 ; Compare also  Matthew 16:19 ;  18:18 ). The "key of knowledge" ( Luke 11:52 ; Compare  Matthew 23:13 ) is the means of attaining the knowledge regarding the kingdom of God. The "power of the keys" is a phrase in general use to denote the extent of ecclesiastical authority.  </p>
Kezia	<p>cassia, the name of Job's second daughter ( 42:14 ), born after prosperity had returned to him.  </p>
Keziz	<p>abrupt; cut off, a city of the tribe of Benjamin ( Joshua 18:21 ).  </p>
Kibroth-hattaavah	<p>the graves of the longing or of lust, one of the stations of the Israelites in the wilderness. It was probably in the Wady Murrah, and has been identified with the Erweis el-Ebeirig, where the remains of an ancient encampment have been found, about 30 miles north-east of Sinai, and exactly a day's journey from 'Ain Hudherah.  </p><p> "Here began the troubles of the journey. First, complaints broke out among the people, probably at the heat, the toil, and the privations of the march; and then God at once punished them by lightning, which fell on the hinder part of the camp, and killed many persons, but ceased at the intercession of Moses ( Numbers 11:1 Numbers 11:2 ). Then a disgust fell on the multitude at having nothing to eat but the manna day after day, no change, no flesh, no fish, no high-flavoured vegetables, no luscious fruits...The people loathed the 'light food,' and cried out to Moses, 'Give us flesh, give us flesh, that we may eat.'" In this emergency Moses, in despair, cried unto God. An answer came. God sent "a prodigious flight of quails, on which the people satiated their gluttonous appetite for a full month. Then punishment fell on them: they loathed the food which they had desired; it bred disease in them; the divine anger aggravated the disease into a plague, and a heavy mortality was the consequence. The dead were buried without the camp; and in memory of man's sin and of the divine wrath this name, Kibroth-hattaavah, the Graves of Lust, was given to the place of their sepulchre" ( Numbers 11:34 Numbers 11:35 ;  Numbers 33:16 Numbers 33:17 ;  Deuteronomy 9:22 ; Compare  Psalms 78:30 Psalms 78:31 )., Rawlinson's Moses, p. 175. From this encampment they journeyed in a north-eastern direction to Hazeroth.  </p>
Kibzaim	<p>two heaps, a city of Ephraim, assigned to the Kohathite Levites, and appointed as a city of refuge ( Joshua 21: :  22 ). It is also called Jokmeam ( 1 Chronicles 6:68 ).  </p>
Kid	<p>the young of the goat. It was much used for food ( Genesis 27:9 ;  38:17 ;  Judges 6:19 ;  14:6 ). The Mosaic law forbade to dress a kid in the milk of its dam, a law which is thrice repeated ( Exodus 23:19 ;  34:26 ;  Deuteronomy 14:21 ). Among the various reasons assigned for this law, that appears to be the most satisfactory which regards it as "a protest against cruelty and outraging the order of nature." A kid cooked in its mother's milk is "a gross, unwholesome dish, and calculated to kindle animal and ferocious passions, and on this account Moses may have forbidden it. Besides, it is even yet associated with immoderate feasting; and originally, I suspect," says Dr. Thomson (Land and the Book), "was connected with idolatrous sacrifices."  </p>
Kidron	<p>= Kedron = Cedron, turbid, the winter torrent which flows through the Valley of Jehoshaphat, on the eastern side of Jerusalem, between the city and the Mount of Olives. This valley is known in Scripture only by the name "the brook Kidron." David crossed this brook bare-foot and weeping, when fleeing from Absalom ( 2 Samuel 15:23 2 Samuel 15:30 ), and it was frequently crossed by our Lord in his journeyings to and fro ( John 18:1 ). Here Asa burned the obscene idols of his mother ( 1 Kings 15:13 ), and here Athaliah was executed ( 2 Kings 11:16 ). It afterwards became the receptacle for all manner of impurities ( 2 Chronicles 29:16 ;  30:14 ); and in the time of Josiah this valley was the common cemetery of the city ( 2 Kings 23:6 ; Compare  Jeremiah 26:23 ).  </p><p> Through this mountain ravine no water runs, except after heavy rains in the mountains round about Jerusalem. Its length from its head to en-Rogel is 2 3/4 miles. Its precipitous, rocky banks are filled with ancient tombs, especially the left bank opposite the temple area. The greatest desire of the Jews is to be buried there, from the idea that the Kidron is the "valley of Jehoshaphat" mentioned in  Joel 3:2 .  </p><p> Below en-Rogel the Kidron has no historical or sacred interest. It runs in a winding course through the wilderness of Judea to the north-western shore of the Dead Sea. Its whole length, in a straight line, is only some 20 miles, but in this space its descent is about 3,912 feet. (See KEDRON .) </p><p> Recent excavations have brought to light the fact that the old bed of the Kidron is about 40 feet lower than its present bed, and about 70 feet nearer the sanctuary wall.  </p>
Kinah	<p>an elegy, a city in the extreme south of Judah ( Joshua 15:22 ). It was probably not far from the Dead Sea, in the Wady Fikreh.  </p>
Laban	<p>white. </p><li> The son of Bethuel, who was the son of Nahor, Abraham's brother. He lived at Haran in Mesopotamia. His sister Rebekah was Isaac's wife ( Genesis 24 ). Jacob, one of the sons of this marriage, fled to the house of Laban, whose daughters Leah and Rachel (ch. 29) he eventually married. (See JACOB .) </li><li> A city in the Arabian desert in the route of the Israelites ( Deuteronomy 1:1 ), probably identical with Libnah ( Numbers 33:20 ).   </li>
Lachish	<p>impregnable, a royal Canaanitish city in the Shephelah, or maritime plain of Palestine ( Joshua 10:3 Joshua 10:5 ;  12:11 ). It was taken and destroyed by the Israelites ( Joshua 10:31-33 ). It afterwards became, under Rehoboam, one of the strongest fortresses of Judah ( 2 Chronicles 10:9 ). It was assaulted and probably taken by Sennacherib ( 2 Kings 18:14 2 Kings 18:17 ;  19:8 ;  Isaiah 36:2 ). An account of this siege is given on some slabs found in the chambers of the palace of Koyunjik, and now in the British Museum. The inscription has been deciphered as follows:, "Sennacherib, the mighty king, king of the country of Assyria, sitting on the throne of judgment before the city of Lachish: I gave permission for its slaughter." (See NINEVEH .) </p><p> Lachish has been identified with Tell-el-Hesy, where a cuneiform tablet has been found, containing a letter supposed to be from Amenophis at Amarna in reply to one of the Amarna tablets sent by Zimrida from Lachish. This letter is from the chief of Atim (=Etam,  1 Chronicles 4:32 ) to the chief of Lachish, in which the writer expresses great alarm at the approach of marauders from the Hebron hills. "They have entered the land," he says, "to lay waste...strong is he who has come down. He lays waste." This letter shows that "the communication by tablets in cuneiform script was not only usual in writing to Egypt, but in the internal correspondence of the country. The letter, though not so important in some ways as the Moabite stone and the Siloam text, is one of the most valuable discoveries ever made in Palestine" (Conder's Tell Amarna Tablets, p. 134).  </p><p> Excavations at Lachish are still going on, and among other discoveries is that of an iron blast-furnace, with slag and ashes, which is supposed to have existed B.C. 1500. If the theories of experts are correct, the use of the hot-air blast instead of cold air (an improvement in iron manufacture patented by Neilson in 1828) was known fifteen hundred years before Christ. (See FURNACE .) </p>
Ladder	<p>occurs only once, in the account of Jacob's vision ( Genesis 28:12 ).  </p>
Laish	<p>a lion. </p><li> A city of the Sidonians, in the extreme north of Palestine ( Judges 18:7 Judges 18:14 ); called also Leshem ( Joshua 19:47 ) and Dan ( Judges 18:7 Judges 18:29 ;  Jeremiah 8:16 ). It lay near the sources of the Jordan, about 4 miles from Paneas. The restless and warlike tribe of Dan (q.v.), looking out for larger possessions, invaded this country and took Laish with its territory. It is identified with the ruin Tell-el-Kady, "the mound of the judge," to the north of the Waters of Merom ( Joshua 11:5 ).  </li><li> A place mentioned in  Isaiah 10:30 . It has been supposed to be the modern el-Isawiyeh, about a mile north-east of Jerusalem.  </li><li> The father of Phalti ( 1 Samuel 25:44 ).   </li>
Lama	<p>( Matthew 27:46 ), a Hebrew word meaning why, quoted from  Psalms 22:1 .  </p>
Lamb	<p></p><li> Heb. kebes, a male lamb from the first to the third year. Offered daily at the morning and the evening sacrifice ( Exodus 29:38-42 ), on the Sabbath day ( Numbers 28:9 ), at the feast of the New Moon ( 28:11 ), of Trumpets ( 29:2 ), of Tabernacles (13-40), of Pentecost ( Leviticus 23:18-20 ), and of the Passover ( Exodus 12:5 ), and on many other occasions ( 1 Chronicles 29:21 ;  2 Chr  29:21 ;  Leviticus 9:3 ;  14:10-25 ).  </li><li> Heb. taleh, a young sucking lamb ( 1 Samuel 7:9 ;  Isaiah 65:25 ). In the symbolical language of Scripture the lamb is the type of meekness and innocence ( Isaiah 11:6 ;  65:25 ;  Luke 10:3 ;  John 21:15 ).  <p> The lamb was a symbol of Christ ( Genesis 4:4 ;  Exodus 12:3 ;  29:38 ;  Isaiah 16:1 ;  53:7 ;  John 1:36 ;  Revelation 13:8 ).  </p><p> Christ is called the Lamb of God ( John 1:29 John 1:36 ), as the great sacrifice of which the former sacrifices were only types ( Numbers 6:12 ;  Leviticus 14:12-17 ;  Isaiah 53:7 ;  1 Corinthians 5:7 ).  </p> </li>
Lamech	<p>the strikerdown; the wild man. </p><li> The fifth in descent from Cain. He was the first to violate the primeval ordinance of marriage ( Genesis 4:18-24 ). His address to his two wives, Adah and Zillah ( Genesis 4:23 Genesis 4:24 ), is the only extant example of antediluvian poetry. It has been called "Lamech's sword-song." He was "rude and ruffianly," fearing neither God nor man. With him the curtain falls on the race of Cain. We know nothing of his descendants.  </li><li> The seventh in descent from Seth, being the only son of Methuselah. Noah was the oldest of his several sons ( Genesis 5:25-31 ;  Luke 3:36 ).   </li>
Lamentation	<p>(Heb. qinah), an elegy or dirge. The first example of this form of poetry is the lament of David over Saul and Jonathan ( 2 Samuel 1:17-27 ). It was a frequent accompaniment of mourning ( Amos 8:10 ). In 2Sam 3:33,34is recorded David's lament over Abner. Prophecy sometimes took the form of a lament when it predicted calamity ( Ezekiel 27:2 Ezekiel 27:32 ;  28:12 ;  Ezekiel 32:2 Ezekiel 32:16 ).  </p>
Lamentations, Book of	<p>called in the Hebrew canon <i> 'Ekhah</i> , meaning "How," being the formula for the commencement of a song of wailing. It is the first word of the book (see  2 Samuel 1:19-27 ). The LXX. adopted the name rendered "Lamentations" (Gr. threnoi = Heb. qinoth) now in common use, to denote the character of the book, in which the prophet mourns over the desolations brought on the city and the holy land by Chaldeans. In the Hebrew Bible it is placed among the Khethubim. (See BIBLE .) </p><p> As to its authorship, there is no room for hesitancy in following the LXX. and the Targum in ascribing it to Jeremiah. The spirit, tone, language, and subject-matter are in accord with the testimony of tradition in assigning it to him. According to tradition, he retired after the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar to a cavern outside the Damascus gate, where he wrote this book. That cavern is still pointed out. "In the face of a rocky hill, on the western side of the city, the local belief has placed 'the grotto of Jeremiah.' There, in that fixed attitude of grief which Michael Angelo has immortalized, the prophet may well be supposed to have mourned the fall of his country" (Stanley, Jewish Church). </p><p> The book consists of five separate poems. In chapter 1 the prophet dwells on the manifold miseries oppressed by which the city sits as a solitary widow weeping sorely. In chapter 2 these miseries are described in connection with the national sins that had caused them. Chapter 3 speaks of hope for the people of God. The chastisement would only be for their good; a better day would dawn for them. Chapter 4 laments the ruin and desolation that had come upon the city and temple, but traces it only to the people's sins. Chapter 5 is a prayer that Zion's reproach may be taken away in the repentance and recovery of the people.  </p><p> The first four poems (chapters) are acrostics, like some of the Psalms (25,34,37,119), i.e., each verse begins with a letter of the Hebrew alphabet taken in order. The first, second, and fourth have each twenty-two verses, the number of the letters in the Hebrew alphabet. The third has sixty-six verses, in which each three successive verses begin with the same letter. The fifth is not acrostic.  </p><p> Speaking of the "Wailing-place (q.v.) of the Jews" at Jerusalem, a portion of the old wall of the temple of Solomon, Schaff says: "There the Jews assemble every Friday afternoon to bewail the downfall of the holy city, kissing the stone wall and watering it with their tears. They repeat from their well-worn Hebrew Bibles and prayer-books the Lamentations of Jeremiah and suitable Psalms." </p>
Lamp	<p></p><li> That part of the candle-sticks of the tabernacle and the temple which bore the light ( Exodus 25:37 ;  1 Kings 7:49 ;  2 Chr.  4:20 ;  13:11 ;  Zechariah 4:2 ). Their form is not described. Olive oil was generally burned in them ( Exodus 27:20 ).  </li><li> A torch carried by the soliders of Gideon ( Judges 7:16 Judges 7:20 ). (RSV, "torches.")  </li><li> Domestic lamps (A.V., "candles") were in common use among the Hebrews ( Matthew 5:15 ;  Mark 4:21 , etc.).  </li><li> Lamps or torches were used in connection with marriage ceremonies ( Matthew 25:1 ).  <p> This word is also frequently metaphorically used to denote life, welfare, guidance, etc. ( 2 Samuel 21:17 ;  Psalms 119:105 ;  Proverbs 6:23 ;  13:9 ).  </p> </li>
Landmark	<p>a boundary line indicated by a stone, stake, etc. ( Deuteronomy 19:14 ;  27:17 ;  Proverbs 22:28 ;  23:10 ;  Job 24:2 ). Landmarks could not be removed without incurring the severe displeasure of God.  </p>
Laodicea	<p>The city of this name mentioned in Scripture lay on the confines of Phrygia and Lydia, about 40 miles east of Ephesus ( Revelation 3:14 ), on the banks of the Lycus. It was originally called Diospolis and then Rhoas, but afterwards Laodicea, from Laodice, the wife of Antiochus II., king of Syria, who rebuilt it. It was one of the most important and flourishing cities of Asia Minor. At a very early period it became one of the chief seats of Christianity ( Colossians 2:1 ;  4:15 ;  Revelation 1:11 , etc.). It is now a deserted place, called by the Turks Eski-hissar or "old castle."  </p>
Laodicea, Epistle from	<p>( Colossians 4:16 ), was probably the Epistle to the Ephesians, as designed for general circulation. It would reach the Colossians by way of Laodicea.  </p>
Lapidoth	<p>torches. Deborah is called "the wife of Lapidoth" ( Judges 4:4 ). Some have rendered the expression "a woman of a fiery spirit," under the supposition that Lapidoth is not a proper name, a woman of a torch-like spirit.  </p>
Lapping	<p>of water like a dog, i.e., by putting the hand filled with water to the mouth. The dog drinks by shaping the end of his long thin tongue into the form of a spoon, thus rapidly lifting up water, which he throws into his mouth. The three hundred men that went with Gideon thus employed their hands and lapped the water out of their hands ( Judges 7:7 ).  </p>
Lapwing	<p>the name of an unclean bird, mentioned only in  Leviticus 11:19  and  Deuteronomy 14:18 . The Hebrew name of this bird, <i> dukiphath</i> , has been generally regarded as denoting the hoope (Upupa epops), an onomatopoetic word derived from the cry of the bird, which resembles the word "hoop;" a bird not uncommon in Palestine. Others identify it with the English peewit. </p>
Lasaea	<p>a city in the island of Crete ( Acts 27:8 ). Its ruins are still found near Cape Leonda, about 5 miles east of "Fair Havens."  </p>
Lasha	<p>fissure, a place apparently east of the Dead Sea ( Genesis 10:19 ). It was afterwards known as Callirhoe, a place famous for its hot springs.  </p>
Latchet	<p>a thong ( Acts 22:25 ), cord, or strap fastening the sandal on the foot ( Isaiah 5:27 ;  Mark 1:7 ;  Luke 3:16 ).  </p>
Latin	<p>the vernacular language of the ancient Romans ( John 19:20 ).  </p>
Lattice	<p></p><li> Heb. 'eshnabh, a latticed opening through which the cool breeze passes ( Judges 5:28 ). The flat roofs of the houses were sometimes enclosed with a parapet of lattice-work on wooden frames, to screen the women of the house from the gaze of the neighbourhood.  </li><li> Heb. harakim, the network or lattice of a window (Cant.  2:9 ).  </li><li> Heb. sebakhah, the latticed balustrade before a window or balcony ( 2 Kings 1:2 ). The lattice window is frequently used in Eastern countries.   </li>
Laver	<p>(Heb. kiyor), a "basin" for boiling in, a "pan" for cooking ( 1 Samuel 2:14 ), a "fire-pan" or hearth ( Zechariah 12:6 ), the sacred wash-bowl of the tabernacle and temple ( Exodus 30:18 Exodus 30:28 ;  31:9 ;  35:16 ;  38:8 ;  39:39 ;  Exodus 40:7 Exodus 40:11 Exodus 40:30 , etc.), a basin for the water used by the priests in their ablutions.  </p><p> That which was originally used in the tabernacle was of brass (rather copper; Heb. nihsheth), made from the metal mirrors the women brought out of Egypt ( Exodus 38:8 ). It contained water wherewith the priests washed their hands and feet when they entered the tabernacle ( 40:32 ). It stood in the court between the altar and the door of the tabernacle ( Exodus 30:19 Exodus 30:21 ).  </p><p> In the temple there were ten lavers used for the sacrifices, and the molten sea for the ablutions of the priests ( 2 Chronicles 4:6 ). The position and uses of these are described  1 Kings 7:23-39 ;  2 Chr  4:6 . The "molten sea" was made of copper, taken from Tibhath and Chun, cities of Hadarezer, king of Zobah ( 1 Chronicles 18:8 ;  1 Kings 7:23-26 ).  </p><p> No lavers are mentioned in the second temple. </p>
Law	<p>a rule of action. </p><li> The Law of Nature is the will of God as to human conduct, founded on the moral difference of things, and discoverable by natural light ( Romans 1:20 ;  Romans 2:14 Romans 2:15 ). This law binds all men at all times. It is generally designated by the term conscience, or the capacity of being influenced by the moral relations of things.  </li><li> The Ceremonial Law prescribes under the Old Testament the rites and ceremonies of worship. This law was obligatory only till Christ, of whom these rites were typical, had finished his work ( Hebrews 7:9 Hebrews 7:11 ;  10:1 ;  Ephesians 2:16 ). It was fulfilled rather than abrogated by the gospel.  </li><li> The Judicial Law, the law which directed the civil policy of the Hebrew nation.  </li><li> The Moral Law is the revealed will of God as to human conduct, binding on all men to the end of time. It was promulgated at Sinai. It is perfect ( Psalms 19:7 ), perpetual ( Matthew 5:17 Matthew 5:18 ), holy ( Romans 7:12 ), good, spiritual (14), and exceeding broad ( Psalms 119:96 ). Although binding on all, we are not under it as a covenant of works ( Galatians 3:17 ). (See COMMANDMENTS .) </li><li> Positive Laws are precepts founded only on the will of God. They are right because God commands them.  </li><li> Moral positive laws are commanded by God because they are right.   </li>
Law of Moses	<p>is the whole body of the Mosaic legislation ( 1 Kings 2:3 ;  2 Kings  <span class="badLink">23:25</span> ;  Ezra 3:2 ). It is called by way of eminence simply "the Law" (Heb. Torah,  Deuteronomy 1:5 ;  Deuteronomy 4:8 Deuteronomy 4:44 ;  Deuteronomy 17:18 Deuteronomy 17:19 ;  Deuteronomy 27:3 Deuteronomy 27:8 ). As a written code it is called the "book of the law of Moses" ( 2 Kings 14:6 ;  Isaiah 8:20 ), the "book of the law of God" ( Joshua 24:26 ).  </p><p> The great leading principle of the Mosaic law is that it is essentially theocratic; i.e., it refers at once to the commandment of God as the foundation of all human duty. </p>
Lawyer	<p>among the Jews, was one versed in the laws of Moses, which he expounded in the schools and synagogues ( Matthew 22:35 ;  Luke 10:25 ). The functions of the "lawyer" and "scribe" were identical. (See DOCTOR .) </p>
Lazarus	<p>an abbreviation of Eleazar, whom God helps. </p><li> The brother of Mary and Martha of Bethany. He was raised from the dead after he had lain four days in the tomb ( John 11:1-44 ). This miracle so excited the wrath of the Jews that they sought to put both Jesus and Lazarus to death.  </li><li> A beggar named in the parable recorded  Luke 16:19-31 .   </li>
Leaf	<p>of a tree. The olive-leaf mentioned  Genesis 8:11 . The barren fig-tree had nothing but leaves ( Matthew 21:19 ;  Mark 11:13 ). The oak-leaf is mentioned  Isaiah 1:30 ;  6:13 . There are numerous allusions to leaves, their flourishing, their decay, and their restoration ( Leviticus 26:36 ;  Isaiah 34:4 ;  Jeremiah 8:13 ;  Daniel 4:12 Daniel 4:14 Daniel 4:21 ;  Mark 11:13 ;  13:28 ). The fresh leaf is a symbol of prosperity ( Psalms 1:3 ;  Jeremiah 17:8 ;  Ezekiel 47:12 ); the faded, of decay ( Job 13:25 ;  Isaiah 1:30 ;  64:6 ;  Jeremiah 8:13 ).  </p><p> Leaf of a door ( 1 Kings 6:34 ), the valve of a folding door.  </p><p> Leaf of a book ( Jeremiah 36:23 ), perhaps a fold of a roll.  </p>
League	<p>a treaty or confederacy. The Jews were forbidden to enter into an alliance of any kind (1) with the Canaanites ( Exodus 23:32 Exodus 23:33 ;  34:12-16 ); (2) with the Amalekites ( Exodus 17:8 Exodus 17:14 ;  Deuteronomy 25:17-19 ); (3) with the Moabites and Ammonites ( Deuteronomy 2:9 Deuteronomy 2:19 ). Treaties were permitted to be entered into with all other nations. Thus David maintained friendly intercourse with the kings of Tyre and Hamath, and Solomon with the kings of Tyre and Egypt.  </p>
Leah	<p>weary, the eldest daughter of Laban, and sister of Rachel ( Genesis 29:16 ). Jacob took her to wife through a deceit of her father ( Genesis 29:23 ). She was "tender-eyed" (17). She bore to Jacob six sons (32-35), also one daughter, Dinah ( 30:21 ). She accompanied Jacob into Canaan, and died there before the time of the going down into Egypt ( Genesis 31 ), and was buried in the cave of Machpelah ( 49:31 ).  </p>
Leannoth	<p>for answering; i.e., in singing, occurs in the title to  Psalms 88 . The title "Mahalath (q.v.) Leannoth" may be rendered "concerning sickness, to be sung" i.e., perhaps, to be sung in sickness.  </p>
Leasing	<p>( Psalms 4:2 ;  5:6 ) an Old English word meaning lies, or lying, as the Hebrew word <i> kazabh</i> is generally rendered. </p>
Leather	<p>a girdle of, worn by Elijah ( 2 Kings 1:8 ) and John the Baptist ( Matthew 3:4 ). Leather was employed both for clothing ( Numbers 31:20 ;  Hebrews 11:37 ) and for writing upon. The trade of a tanner is mentioned ( Acts 9:43 ;  Acts 10:6 Acts 10:32 ). It was probably learned in Egypt.  </p>
Leaven	<p></p><li> Heb. seor ( Exodus 12:15 Exodus 12:19 ;  13:7 ;  Leviticus 2:11 ), the remnant of dough from the preceding baking which had fermented and become acid.  </li><li> Heb. hamets, properly "ferment." In  Numbers 6:3 , "vinegar of wine" is more correctly "fermented wine." In  Exodus 13:7 , the proper rendering would be, "Unfermented things [Heb. matstsoth] shall be consumed during the seven days; and there shall not be seen with thee fermented things [hamets], and there shall not be seen with thee leavened mass [seor] in all thy borders." The chemical definition of ferment or yeast is "a substance in a state of putrefaction, the atoms of which are in a continual motion."  <p> The use of leaven was strictly forbidden in all offerings made to the Lord by fire ( Leviticus 2:11 ;  7:12 ;  8:2 ;  Numbers 6:15 ). Its secretly penetrating and diffusive power is referred to in  1 Corinthians 5:6 . In this respect it is used to illustrate the growth of the kingdom of heaven both in the individual heart and in the world ( Matthew 13:33 ). It is a figure also of corruptness and of perverseness of heart and life ( Matthew 16:6 Matthew 16:11 ;  Mark 8:15 ;  1 Corinthians 5:7 1 Corinthians 5:8 ).  </p> </li>
Lebanon	<p>white, "the white mountain of Syria," is the loftiest and most celebrated mountain range in Syria. It is a branch running southward from the Caucasus, and at its lower end forking into two parallel ranges, the eastern or Anti-Lebanon, and the western or Lebanon proper. They enclose a long valley ( Joshua 11:17 ) of from 5 to 8 miles in width, called by Roman writers Coele-Syria, now called el-Buka'a, "the valley," a prolongation of the valley of the Jordan.  </p><p> Lebanon proper, Jebel es-Sharki, commences at its southern extremity in the gorge of the Leontes, the ancient Litany, and extends north-east, parallel to the Mediterranean coast, as far as the river Eleutherus, at the plain of Emesa, "the entering of Hamath" ( Numbers 34:8 ;  1 Kings 8:65 ), in all about 90 geographical miles in extent. The average height of this range is from 6,000 to 8,000 feet; the peak of Jebel Mukhmel is about 10,200 feet, and the Sannin about 9,000. The highest peaks are covered with perpetual snow and ice. In the recesses of the range wild beasts as of old still abound ( 2 Kings 14:9 ; Cant  4:8 ). The scenes of the Lebanon are remarkable for their grandeur and beauty, and supplied the sacred writers with many expressive similes ( Psalms 29:5 Psalms 29:6 ;  72:16 ;  104:16-18 ; Cant  4:15 ;  Isaiah 2:13 ;  35:2 ;  60:13 ;  Hosea 14:5 ). It is famous for its cedars (Cant  5:15 ), its wines ( Hosea 14:7 ), and its cool waters ( Jeremiah 18:14 ). The ancient inhabitants were Giblites and Hivites ( Joshua 13:5 ;  Judges 3:3 ). It was part of the Phoenician kingdom ( 1 Kings 5:2-6 ).  </p><p> The eastern range, or Anti-Lebanon, or "Lebanon towards the sunrising," runs nearly parallel with the western from the plain of Emesa till it connects with the hills of Galilee in the south. The height of this range is about 5,000 feet. Its highest peak is Hermon (q.v.), from which a number of lesser ranges radiate.  </p><p> Lebanon is first mentioned in the description of the boundary of Palestine ( Deuteronomy 1:7 ;  11:24 ). It was assigned to Israel, but was never conquered ( Joshua 13:2-6 ;  Judges 3:1-3 ).  </p><p> The Lebanon range is now inhabited by a population of about 300,000 Christians, Maronites, and Druses, and is ruled by a Christian governor. The Anti-Lebanon is inhabited by Mohammedans, and is under a Turkish ruler.  </p>
Lebbaeus	<p>courageous, a surname of Judas (Jude), one of the twelve ( Matthew 10:3 ), called also Thaddaeus, not to be confounded with the Judas who was the brother of our Lord.  </p>
Lebonah	<p>frankincense, a town near Shiloh, on the north side of Bethel ( Judges 21:19 ). It has been identified with el-Lubban, to the south of Nablus.  </p>
Leek	<p>(Heb. hatsir; the Allium porrum), rendered "grass" in 1Kings  <span class="badLink">1 Kings 19:26</span> ,  Job 40:15 , etc.; "herb" in  Job 8:12 ; "hay" in  Proverbs 27:25 , and  Isaiah 15:6 ; "leeks" only in  Numbers 11:5 . This Hebrew word seems to denote in this last passage simply herbs, such as lettuce or savoury herbs cooked as kitchen vegetables, and not necessarily what are now called leeks. The leek was a favourite vegetable in Egypt, and is still largely cultivated there and in Palestine.  </p>
Lees	<p>(Heb. shemarim), from a word meaning to keep or preserve. It was applied to "lees" from the custom of allowing wine to stand on the lees that it might thereby be better preserved ( Isaiah 25:6 ). "Men settled on their lees" ( Zephaniah 1:12 ) are men "hardened or crusted." The image is derived from the crust formed at the bottom of wines long left undisturbed ( Jeremiah 48:11 ). The effect of wealthy undisturbed ease on the ungodly is hardening. They become stupidly secure (Compare  Psalms 55:19 ;  Amos 6:1 ). To drink the lees ( Psalms 75:8 ) denotes severe suffering.  </p>
Left hand	<p>among the Hebrews, denoted the north ( Job 23:9 ;  Genesis 14:15 ), the face of the person being supposed to be toward the east.  </p>
Left-handed	<p>( Judges 3:15 ;  20:16 ), one unable to use the right hand skilfully, and who therefore uses the left; and also one who uses the left as well as the right, ambidexter. Such a condition of the hands is due to physical causes. This quality was common apparently in the tribe of Benjamin.  </p>
Legion	<p>a regiment of the Roman army, the number of men composing which differed at different times. It originally consisted of three thousand men, but in the time of Christ consisted of six thousand, exclusive of horsemen, who were in number a tenth of the foot-men. The word is used ( Matthew 26:53 ;  Mark 5:9 ) to express simply a great multitude.  </p>
Lehi	<p>a jawbone, a place in the tribe of Judah where Samson achieved a victory over the Philistines ( Judges 15:9 Judges 15:14 Judges 15:16 ), slaying a thousand of them with the jawbone of an ass. The words in  15:19 , "a hollow place that was in the jaw" (A.V.), should be, as in Revised Version, "the hollow place that is in Lehi."  </p>
Lemuel	<p>dedicated to God, a king whom his mother instructed ( Proverbs 31:1-9 ). Nothing is certainly known concerning him. The rabbis identified him with Solomon.  </p>
Lentiles	<p>(Heb. 'adashim), a species of vetch ( Genesis 25:34 ;  2 Sam  23:11 ), common in Syria under the name addas. The red pottage made by Jacob was of lentils ( Genesis 25:29-34 ). They were among the provisions brought to David when he fled from Absalom ( 2 Samuel 17:28 ). It is the Ervum lens of Linnaeus, a leguminous plant which produces a fruit resembling a bean.  </p>
Leopard	<p>(Heb. namer, so called because spotted, Cant  4:8 ), was that great spotted feline which anciently infested the mountains of Syria, more appropriately called a panther (Felis pardus). Its fierceness ( Isaiah 11:6 ), its watching for its prey ( Jeremiah 5:6 ), its swiftness ( Habakkuk 1:8 ), and the spots of its skin ( Jeremiah 13:23 ), are noticed. This word is used symbolically ( Daniel 7:6 ;  Revelation 13:2 ).  </p>
Leprosy	<p>(Heb. tsara'ath, a "smiting," a "stroke," because the disease was regarded as a direct providential infliction). This name is from the Greek lepra, by which the Greek physicians designated the disease from its scaliness. We have the description of the disease, as well as the regulations connected with it, in  Leviticus 13 ;  14 ;  Numbers 12:10-15 , etc. There were reckoned six different circumstances under which it might develop itself, (1) without any apparent cause ( Leviticus 13:2-8 ); (2) its reappearance (9-17); (3) from an inflammation (18-28); (4) on the head or chin (29-37); (5) in white polished spots (38,39); (6) at the back or in the front of the head (40-44).  </p><p> Lepers were required to live outside the camp or city ( Numbers 5:1-4 ;  12:10-15 , etc.). This disease was regarded as an awful punishment from the Lord ( 2 Kings 5:7 ;  2 Chr  26:20 ). (See MIRIAM; GEHAZI;  UZZIAH .) </p><p> This disease "begins with specks on the eyelids and on the palms, gradually spreading over the body, bleaching the hair white wherever they appear, crusting the affected parts with white scales, and causing terrible sores and swellings. From the skin the disease eats inward to the bones, rotting the whole body piecemeal." "In Christ's day no leper could live in a walled town, though he might in an open village. But wherever he was he was required to have his outer garment rent as a sign of deep grief, to go bareheaded, and to cover his beard with his mantle, as if in lamentation at his own virtual death. He had further to warn passers-by to keep away from him, by calling out, 'Unclean! unclean!' nor could he speak to any one, or receive or return a salutation, since in the East this involves an embrace." </p><p> That the disease was not contagious is evident from the regulations regarding it ( Leviticus 13:12 Leviticus 13:13 Leviticus 13:36 ;  2 Kings  5:1 ). Leprosy was "the outward and visible sign of the innermost spiritual corruption; a meet emblem in its small beginnings, its gradual spread, its internal disfigurement, its dissolution little by little of the whole body, of that which corrupts, degrades, and defiles man's inner nature, and renders him unmeet to enter the presence of a pure and holy God" (Maclear's Handbook O.T). Our Lord cured lepers ( Matthew 8:2 Matthew 8:3 ;  Mark 1:40-42 ). This divine power so manifested illustrates his gracious dealings with men in curing the leprosy of the soul, the fatal taint of sin.  </p>
Letter	<p>in Rom 2:27,29means the outward form. The "oldness of the letter" ( 7:6 ) is a phrase which denotes the old way of literal outward obedience to the law as a system of mere external rules of conduct. In  2 Corinthians 3:6 , "the letter" means the Mosaic law as a written law. (See WRITING .) </p>
Leummim	<p>peoples; nations, the last mentioned of the three sons of Dedan, and head of an Arabian tribe ( Genesis 25:3 ).  </p>
Levi	<p>adhesion. </p><li> The third son of Jacob by Leah. The origin of the name is found in Leah's words ( Genesis 29:34 ), "This time will my husband be joined [Heb. yillaveh] unto me." He is mentioned as taking a prominent part in avenging his sister Dinah ( Genesis 34:25-31 ). He and his three sons went down with Jacob ( 46:11 ) into Egypt, where he died at the age of one hundred and thirty-seven years ( Exodus 6:16 ).  </li><li> The father of Matthat, and son of Simeon, of the ancestors of Christ ( Luke 3:29 ).  </li><li> Luke 3:24 .  </li><li> One of the apostles, the son of Alphaeus ( Mark 2:14 ;  Luke 5:27 Luke 5:29 ), called also Matthew ( Matthew 9:9 ).   </li>
Leviathan	<p>a transliterated Hebrew word (livyathan), meaning "twisted," "coiled." In  Job 3:8 , Revised Version, and marg. of Authorized Version, it denotes the dragon which, according to Eastern tradition, is an enemy of light; in  41:1  the crocodile is meant; in  Psalms 104:26  it "denotes any large animal that moves by writhing or wriggling the body, the whale, the monsters of the deep." This word is also used figuratively for a cruel enemy, as some think "the Egyptian host, crushed by the divine power, and cast on the shores of the Red Sea" ( Psalms 74:14 ). As used in  Isaiah 27:1 , "leviathan the piercing [RSV 'swift'] serpent, even leviathan that crooked [RSV marg. 'winding'] serpent," the word may probably denote the two empires, the Assyrian and the Babylonian.  </p>
Levirate Law	<p>from Latin levir, "a husband's brother," the name of an ancient custom ordained by Moses, by which, when an Israelite died without issue, his surviving brother was required to marry the widow, so as to continue his brother's family through the son that might be born of that marriage ( Genesis 38:8 ;  Deuteronomy 25:5-10 ; Compare  Ruth 3 ;  4:10 ). Its object was "to raise up seed to the departed brother."  </p>
Levite	<p>a descendant of the tribe of Levi ( Exodus 6:25 ;  Leviticus 25:32 ;  Numbers 35:2 ;  Joshua 21:3 Joshua 21:41 ). This name is, however, generally used as the title of that portion of the tribe which was set apart for the subordinate offices of the sanctuary service ( 1 Kings 8:4 ;  Ezra 2:70 ), as assistants to the priests.  </p><p> When the Israelites left Egypt, the ancient manner of worship was still observed by them, the eldest son of each house inheriting the priest's office. At Sinai the first change in this ancient practice was made. A hereditary priesthood in the family of Aaron was then instituted ( Exodus 28:1 ). But it was not till that terrible scene in connection with the sin of the golden calf that the tribe of Levi stood apart and began to occupy a distinct position ( Exodus 32 ). The religious primogeniture was then conferred on this tribe, which henceforth was devoted to the service of the sanctuary ( Numbers 3:11-13 ). They were selected for this purpose because of their zeal for the glory of God ( Exodus 32:26 ), and because, as the tribe to which Moses and Aaron belonged, they would naturally stand by the lawgiver in his work.  </p><p> The Levitical order consisted of all the descendants of Levi's three sons, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari; whilst Aaron, Amram's son (Amram, son of Kohat), and his issue constituted the priestly order. </p><p> The age and qualification for Levitical service are specified in  Numbers 4:3 Numbers 4:23 Numbers 4:30 Numbers 4:39 Numbers 4:43 Numbers 4:47 .  </p><p> They were not included among the armies of Israel ( Numbers 1:47 ;  2:33 ;  26:62 ), but were reckoned by themselves. They were the special guardians of the tabernacle ( Numbers 1:51 ;  18:22-24 ). The Gershonites pitched their tents on the west of the tabernacle ( 3:23 ), the Kohathites on the south ( 3:29 ), the Merarites on the north ( 3:35 ), and the priests on the east ( 3:38 ). It was their duty to move the tent and carry the parts of the sacred structure from place to place. They were given to Aaron and his sons the priests to wait upon them and do work for them at the sanctuary services ( Numbers 8:19 ;  18:2-6 ).  </p><p> As being wholly consecrated to the service of the Lord, they had no territorial possessions. Jehovah was their inheritance ( Numbers 18:20 ;  26:62 ;  Deuteronomy 10:9 ;  Deuteronomy 18:1 Deuteronomy 18:2 ), and for their support it was ordained that they should receive from the other tribes the tithes of the produce of the land. Forty-eight cities also were assigned to them, thirteen of which were for the priests "to dwell in", i.e., along with their other inhabitants. Along with their dwellings they had "suburbs", i.e., "commons", for their herds and flocks, and also fields and vineyards ( Numbers 35:2-5 ). Nine of these cities were in Judah, three in Naphtali, and four in each of the other tribes ( Joshua 21 ). Six of the Levitical cities were set apart as "cities of refuge" (q.v.). Thus the Levites were scattered among the tribes to keep alive among them the knowledge and service of God. (See PRIEST .) </p>
Leviticus	<p>the third book of the Pentateuch; so called in the Vulgate, after the LXX., because it treats chiefly of the Levitical service. </p><p> In the first section of the book (1-17), which exhibits the worship itself, there is, </p><li> A series of laws (1-7) regarding sacrifices, burnt-offerings, meat-offerings, and thank-offerings (1-3), sin-offerings and trespass-offerings (4; 5), followed by the law of the priestly duties in connection with the offering of sacrifices (6; 7). </li><li> An historical section (8-10), giving an account of the consecration of Aaron and his sons (8); Aaron's first offering for himself and the people (9); Nadab and Abihu's presumption in offering "strange fire before Jehovah," and their punishment (10). </li><li> Laws concerning purity, and the sacrifices and ordinances for putting away impurity (11-16). An interesting fact may be noted here. Canon Tristram, speaking of the remarkable discoveries regarding the flora and fauna of the Holy Land by the Palestine Exploration officers, makes the following statement:, "Take these two catalogues of the clean and unclean animals in the books of Leviticus [11] and Deuteronomy [14]. There are eleven in Deuteronomy which do not occur in Leviticus, and these are nearly all animals and birds which are not found in Egypt or the Holy Land, but which are numerous in the Arabian desert. They are not named in Leviticus a few weeks after the departure from Egypt; but after the people were thirty-nine years in the desert they are named, a strong proof that the list in Deuteronomy was written at the end of the journey, and the list in Leviticus at the beginning. It fixes the writing of that catalogue to one time and period only, viz., that when the children of Israel were familiar with the fauna and the flora of the desert" (Palest. Expl. Quart., Jan. 1887). </li><li> Laws marking the separation between Israel and the heathen (17-20). </li><li> Laws about the personal purity of the priests, and their eating of the holy things (20; 21); about the offerings of Israel, that they were to be without blemish ( 22:17-33 ); and about the due celebration of the great festivals (23; 25). </li><li> Then follow promises and warnings to the people regarding obedience to these commandments, closing with a section on vows.  <p> The various ordinances contained in this book were all delivered in the space of a month (Compare  Exodus 40:17 ;  Numbers 1:1 ), the first month of the second year after the Exodus. It is the third book of Moses.  </p><p> No book contains more of the very words of God. He is almost throughout the whole of it the direct speaker. This book is a prophecy of things to come, a shadow whereof the substance is Christ and his kingdom. The principles on which it is to be interpreted are laid down in the Epistle to the Hebrews. It contains in its complicated ceremonial the gospel of the grace of God. </p> </li>
Levy	<p>( 1 Kings 4:6 , RSV;  5:13 ), forced service. The service of tributaries was often thus exacted by kings. Solomon raised a "great levy" of 30,000 men, about two per cent. of the population, to work for him by courses on Lebanon. Adoram ( 12:18 ) presided over this forced labour service (Ger. Frohndienst; Fr. corvee).  </p>
Lewdness	<p>( Acts 18:14 ), villany or wickedness, not lewdness in the modern sense of the word. The word "lewd" is from the Saxon, and means properly "ignorant," "unlearned," and hence low, vicious ( Acts 17:5 ).  </p>
Libertine	<p>found only  Acts 6:9 , one who once had been a slave, but who had been set at liberty, or the child of such a person. In this case the name probably denotes those descendants of Jews who had been carried captives to Rome as prisoners of war by Pompey and other Roman generals in the Syrian wars, and had afterwards been liberated. In A.D. 19 these manumitted Jews were banished from Rome. Many of them found their way to Jerusalem, and there established a synagogue.  </p>
Libnah	<p>transparency; whiteness. </p><li> One of the stations of the Israelites in the wilderness ( Numbers 33:20 Numbers 33:21 ).  </li><li> One of the royal cities of the Canaanites taken by Joshua ( Joshua 10:29-32 ;  12:15 ). It became one of the Levitical towns in the tribe of Judah ( 21:13 ), and was strongly fortified. Sennacherib laid siege to it ( 2 Kings 19:8 ;  Isaiah 37:8 ). It was the native place of Hamutal, the queen of Josiah ( 2 Kings 23:31 ). It stood near Lachish, and has been identified with the modern Arak el-Menshiyeh.   </li>
Libni	<p>white, one of the two sons of Gershon, the son of Levi ( Exodus 6:17 ;  Numbers 3:18 Numbers 3:21 ). (See LAADAN (n/a).)  </p>
Maachah	<p>oppression, a small Syrian kingdom near Geshur, east of the Hauran, the district of Batanea ( Joshua 13:13 ;  2 Sam  Joshua 10:6 Joshua 10:8 ;  1 Chronicles 19:7 ).  </p><li> A daughter of Talmai, king of the old native population of Geshur. She became one of David's wives, and was the mother of Absalom ( 2 Samuel 3:3 ).  </li><li> The father of Hanan, who was one of David's body-guard ( 1 Chronicles 11:43 ).  </li><li> The daughter of Abishalom (called Absalom,  2 Chronicles 11:20-22 ), the third wife of Rehoboam, and mother of Abijam ( 1 Kings 15:2 ). She is called "Michaiah the daughter of Uriel," who was the husband of Absalom's daughter Tamar ( 2 Chronicles 13:2 ). Her son Abijah or Abijam was heir to the throne.  </li><li> The father of Achish, the king of Gath ( 1 Kings 2:39 ), called also Maoch ( 1 Samuel 27:2 ).   </li>
Maaleh-acrabbim	<p>ascent of the scorpions; i.e., "scorpion-hill", a pass on the south-eastern border of Palestine ( Numbers 34:4 ;  Joshua 15:3 ). It is identified with the pass of Sufah, entering Palestine from the great Wady el-Fikreh, south of the Dead Sea. (See AKRABBIM .) </p>
Maarath	<p>desolation, a place in the mountains of Judah ( Joshua 15:59 ), probably the modern village Beit Ummar, 6 miles north of Hebron.  </p>
Maaseiah	<p>the work of Jehovah. </p><li> One of the Levites whom David appointed as porter for the ark ( 1 Chronicles 15:18 1 Chronicles 15:20 ).  </li><li> One of the "captains of hundreds" associated with Jehoiada in restoring king Jehoash to the throne ( 2 Chronicles 23:1 ).  </li><li> The "king's son," probably one of the sons of king Ahaz, killed by Zichri in the invasion of Judah by Pekah, king of Israel ( 2 Chronicles 28:7 ).  </li><li> One who was sent by king Josiah to repair the temple ( 2 Chronicles 34:8 ). He was governor (Heb. sar, rendered elsewhere in the Authorized Version "prince," "chief captain," chief ruler") of Jerusalem.  </li><li> The father of the priest Zephaniah ( Jeremiah 21:1 ;  37:3 ).  </li><li> The father of the false prophet Zedekiah ( Jeremiah 29:21 ).  <p> Maase'iah, refuge is Jehovah, a priest, the father of Neriah ( Jeremiah 32:12 ;  51:59 ).  </p> </li>
Maasiai	<p>work of Jehovah, one of the priests resident at Jerusalem at the Captivity ( 1 Chronicles 9:12 ).  </p>
Maath	<p>small, a person named in our Lord's ancestry ( Luke 3:26 ).  </p>
Maaziah	<p>strength or consolation of Jehovah. </p><li> The head of the twenty-fourth priestly course ( 1 Chronicles 24:18 ) in David's reign.  </li><li> A priest ( Nehemiah 10:8 ).   </li>
Maccabees	<p>This word does not occur in Scripture. It was the name given to the leaders of the national party among the Jews who suffered in the persecution under Antiochus Epiphanes, who succeeded to the Syrian throne B.C. 175. It is supposed to have been derived from the Hebrew word (makkabah) meaning "hammer," as suggestive of the heroism and power of this Jewish family, who are, however, more properly called Asmoneans or Hasmonaeans, the origin of which is much disputed.  </p><p> After the expulsion of Antiochus Epiphanes from Egypt by the Romans, he gave vent to his indignation on the Jews, great numbers of whom he mercilessly put to death in Jerusalem. He oppressed them in every way, and tried to abolish altogether the Jewish worship. Mattathias, an aged priest, then residing at Modin, a city to the west of Jerusalem, became now the courageous leader of the national party; and having fled to the mountains, rallied round him a large band of men prepared to fight and die for their country and for their religion, which was now violently suppressed. In 1Macc  <span class="badLink">2:60</span>  is recorded his dying counsels to his sons with reference to the war they were now to carry on. His son Judas, "the Maccabee," succeeded him (B.C. 166) as the leader in directing the war of independence, which was carried on with great heroism on the part of the Jews, and was terminated in the defeat of the Syrians.  </p>
Maccabees, Books of the	<p>There were originally five books of the Maccabees. The first contains a history of the war of independence, commencing (B.C. 175) in a series of patriotic struggles against the tyranny of Antiochus Epiphanes, and terminating B.C. 135. It became part of the Vulgate Version of the Bible, and was thus retained among the Apocrypha.  </p><p> The second gives a history of the Maccabees' struggle from B.C. 176 to B.C. 161. Its object is to encourage and admonish the Jews to be faithful to the religion of their fathers.  </p><p> The third does not hold a place in the Apocrypha, but is read in the Greek Church. Its design is to comfort the Alexandrian Jews in their persecution. Its writer was evidently an Alexandrian Jew. </p><p> The fourth was found in the Library of Lyons, but was afterwards burned. The fifth contains a history of the Jews from B.C. 184 to B.C. 86. It is a compilation made by a Jew after the destruction of Jerusalem, from ancient memoirs, to which he had access. It need scarcely be added that none of these books has any divine authority.  </p>
Macedonia	<p>in New Testament times, was a Roman province lying north of Greece. It was governed by a propraetor with the title of proconsul. Paul was summoned by the vision of the "man of Macedonia" to preach the gospel there ( Acts 16:9 ). Frequent allusion is made to this event ( 18:5 ;  19:21 ;  Romans 15:26 ;  2 co.  1:16 ;  11:9 ; Phil  4:15 ). The history of Paul's first journey through Macedonia is given in detail in  Acts 16:10-17:15. . At the close of this journey he returned from Corinth to Syria. He again passed through this country ( 20:1-6 ), although the details of the route are not given. After many years he probably visited it for a third time (Phil  2:24 ;  1 Timothy 1:3 ). The first convert made by Paul in Europe was ( Acts 16:13-15 ) Lydia (q.v.), a "seller of purple," residing in Philippi, the chief city of the eastern division of Macedonia.  </p>
Machaerus	<p>the Black Fortress, was built by Herod the Great in the gorge of Callirhoe, one of the wadies 9 miles east of the Dead Sea, as a frontier rampart against Arab marauders. John the Baptist was probably cast into the prison connected with this castle by Herod Antipas, whom he had reproved for his adulterous marriage with Herodias. Here Herod "made a supper" on his birthday. He was at this time marching against Aretas, king of Perea, to whose daughter he had been married. During the revelry of the banquet held in the border fortress, to please Salome, who danced before him, he sent an executioner, who beheaded John, and "brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel" ( Mark 6:14-29 ). This castle stood "starkly bold and clear" 3,860 feet above the Dead Sea, and 2,546 above the Mediterranean. Its ruins, now called M'khaur, are still visible on the northern end of Jebel Attarus.  </p>
Machbanai	<p>clad with a mantle, or bond of the Lord, one of the Gadite heroes who joined David in the wilderness ( 1 Chronicles 12:13 ).  </p>
Machir	<p>sold. </p><li> Manasseh's oldest son ( Joshua 17:1 ), or probably his only son (see  1 Chronicles 7:14 1 Chronicles 7:15 ; Compare  Numbers 26:29-33 ;  Joshua 13:31 ). His descendants are referred to under the name of Machirites, being the offspring of Gilead ( Numbers 26:29 ). They settled in land taken from the Amorites ( Numbers 32:39 Numbers 32:40 ;  Deuteronomy 3:15 ) by a special enactment ( Numbers 36:1-3 ;  Joshua 17:3 Joshua 17:4 ). He is once mentioned as the representative of the tribe of Manasseh east of Jordan ( Judges 5:14 ).  </li><li> A descendant of the preceding, residing at Lo-debar, where he maintained Jonathan's son Mephibosheth till he was taken under the care of David ( 2 Samuel 9:4 ), and where he afterwards gave shelter to David himself when he was a fugitive ( 17:27 ).   </li>
Machpelah	<p>portion; double cave, the cave which Abraham bought, together with the field in which it stood, from Ephron the Hittite, for a family burying-place ( Genesis 23 ). It is one of those Bible localities about the identification of which there can be no doubt. It was on the slope of a hill on the east of Hebron, "before Mamre." Here were laid the bodies of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah ( Genesis 23:19 ;  25:9 ;  49:31 ;  50:13 ). Over the cave an ancient Christian church was erected, probably in the time of Justinian, the Roman emperor. This church has been converted into a Mohammedan mosque. The whole is surrounded by the el-Haram i.e., "the sacred enclosure," about 200 feet long, 115 broad, and of an average height of about 50. This building, from the immense size of some of its stones, and the manner in which they are fitted together, is supposed by some to have been erected in the days of David or of Solomon, while others ascribe it to the time of Herod. It is looked upon as the most ancient and finest relic of Jewish architecture.  </p><p> On the floor of the mosque are erected six large cenotaphs as monuments to the dead who are buried in the cave beneath. Between the cenotaphs of Isaac and Rebekah there is a circular opening in the floor into the cavern below, the cave of Machpelah. Here it may be that the body of Jacob, which was embalmed in Egypt, is still preserved (much older embalmed bodies have recently been found in the cave of Deir el-Bahari in Egypt, see PHARAOH), though those of the others there buried may have long ago mouldered into dust. The interior of the mosque was visited by the Prince of Wales in 1862 by a special favour of the Mohammedan authorities. An interesting account of this visit is given in Dean Stanley's Lectures on the Jewish Church. It was also visited in 1866 by the Marquis of Bute, and in 1869 by the late Emperor (Frederick) of Germany, then the Crown Prince of Prussia. In 1881 it was visited by the two sons of the Prince of Wales, accompanied by Sir C. Wilson and others. (See Palestine Quarterly Statement, October 1882).  </p>
Madai	<p>middle land, the third "son" of Japheth ( Genesis 10:2 ), the name by which the Medes are known on the Assyrian monuments.  </p>
Madmannah	<p>dunghill, the modern el-Minyay, 15 miles south-south-west of Gaza ( Joshua 15:31 ;  1 Chronicles 2:49 ), in the south of Judah. The Pal. Mem., however, suggest Umm Deimneh, 12 miles north-east of Beersheba, as the site.  </p>
Madmen	<p>ibid., a Moabite town threatened with the sword of the Babylonians ( Jeremiah 48:2 ).  </p>
Madmenah	<p>ibid., a town in Benjamin, not far from Jerusalem, towards the north ( Isaiah 10:31 ). The same Hebrew word occurs in  Isaiah 25:10 , where it is rendered "dunghill." This verse has, however, been interpreted as meaning "that Moab will be trodden down by Jehovah as teben [broken straw] is trodden to fragments on the threshing-floors of Madmenah."  </p>
Madness	<p>This word is used in its proper sense in  Deuteronomy 28:34 , John 10:20,  1 Corinthians 14:23 . It also denotes a reckless state of mind arising from various causes, as over-study (Eccl  1:17 ;  2:12 ), blind rage ( Luke 6:11 ), or a depraved temper (Eccl  7:25 ;  9:3 ;  2 Pet  2:16 ). David feigned madness ( 1 Samuel 21:13 ) at Gath because he "was sore afraid of Achish."  </p>
Madon	<p>strife, a Canaanitish city in the north of Palestine ( Joshua 11:1 ;  12:19 ), whose king was slain by Joshua; perhaps the ruin Madin, near Hattin, some 5 miles west of Tiberias.  </p>
Magdala	<p>a tower, a town in Galilee, mentioned only in  Matthew 15:39 . In the parallel passage in  Mark 8:10  this place is called Dalmanutha. It was the birthplace of Mary called the Magdalen, or Mary Magdalene. It was on the west shore of the Lake of Tiberias, and is now probably the small obscure village called el-Mejdel, about 3 miles north-west of Tiberias. In the Talmud this city is called "the city of colour," and a particular district of it was called "the tower of dyers." The indigo plant was much cultivated here.  </p>
Magdalene	<p>a surname derived from Magdala, the place of her nativity, given to one of the Marys of the Gospels to distinguish her from the other Marys ( Matthew 27:56 Matthew 27:61 ;  28:1 , etc.). A mistaken notion has prevailed that this Mary was a woman of bad character, that she was the woman who is emphatically called "a sinner" ( Luke 7:36-50 ). (See MARY .) </p>
Magic	<p>The Jews seem early to have consulted the teraphim (q.v.) for oracular answers ( Judges 18:5 Judges 18:6 ;  Zechariah 10:2 ). There is a remarkable illustration of this divining by teraphim in Ezek.  21:19-22 . We read also of the divining cup of Joseph ( Genesis 44:5 ). The magicians of Egypt are frequently referred to in the history of the Exodus. Magic was an inherent part of the ancient Egyptian religion, and entered largely into their daily life.  </p><p> All magical arts were distinctly prohibited under penalty of death in the Mosaic law. The Jews were commanded not to learn the "abomination" of the people of the Promised Land ( Leviticus 19:31 ;  Deuteronomy 18:9-14 ). The history of Saul's consulting the witch of Endor ( 1 Samuel 28:3-20 ) gives no warrant for attributing supernatural power to magicians. From the first the witch is here only a bystander. The practice of magic lingered among the people till after the Captivity, when they gradually abandoned it.  </p><p> It is not much referred to in the New Testament. The Magi mentioned in  Matthew 2:1-12  were not magicians in the ordinary sense of the word. They belonged to a religious caste, the followers of Zoroaster, the astrologers of the East. Simon, a magician, was found by Philip at Samaria ( Acts 8:9-24 ); and Paul and Barnabas encountered Elymas, a Jewish sorcerer, at Paphos ( 13:6-12 ). At Ephesus there was a great destruction of magical books ( Acts 19:18 Acts 19:19 ).  </p>
Magicians	<p>Heb. hartumim, ( Daniel 1:20 ) were sacred scribes who acted as interpreters of omens, or "revealers of secret things."  </p>
Magistrate	<p>a public civil officer invested with authority. The Hebrew shophetim, or judges, were magistrates having authority in the land ( Deuteronomy 1:16 Deuteronomy 1:17 ). In  Judges 18:7  the word "magistrate" (A.V.) is rendered in the Revised Version "possessing authority", i.e., having power to do them harm by invasion. In the time of ( Ezra 9:2 ) and ( Nehemiah 2:16 ;  4:14 ;  13:11 ) the Jewish magistrates were called <i> seganim</i> , properly meaning "nobles." In the New Testament the Greek word <i> archon</i> , rendered "magistrate" ( Luke 12:58 ;  Titus 3:1 ), means one first in power, and hence a prince, as in Matt  Matthew 2:6 Matthew 2:8 . This term is used of the Messiah, "Prince of the kings of the earth" ( Revelation 1:5 ). In  Acts 16:20 Acts 16:22 Acts 16:35 Acts 16:36 Acts 16:38 , the Greek term <i> strategos</i> , rendered "magistrate," properly signifies the leader of an army, a general, one having military authority. The <i> strategoi</i> were the duumviri, the two praetors appointed to preside over the administration of justice in the colonies of the Romans. They were attended by the sergeants (properly lictors or "rod bearers"). </p>
Magog	<p>region of Gog, the second of the "sons" of Japheth ( Genesis 10:2 ;  1 Chronicles 1:5 ). In ( Ezekiel 38:2 ;  39:6 ) it is the name of a nation, probably some Scythian or Tartar tribe descended from Japheth. They are described as skilled horsemen, and expert in the use of the bow. The Latin father Jerome says that this word denotes "Scythian nations, fierce and innumerable, who live beyond the Caucasus and the Lake Maeotis, and near the Caspian Sea, and spread out even onward to India." Perhaps the name "represents the Assyrian Mat Gugi, or 'country of Gugu,' the Gyges of the Greeks" (Sayce's Races, etc.).  </p>
Magor-missabib	<p>fear on every side, ( Jeremiah 20:3 ), a symbolical name given to the priest Pashur, expressive of the fate announced by the prophet as about to come upon him. Pashur was to be carried to Babylon, and there die.  </p>
Mahalaleel	<p>praise of God. </p><li> The son of Cainan, of the line of Seth ( Genesis 5:12-17 ); called Maleleel ( Luke 3:37 ).  </li><li> Nehemiah 11:4 , a descendant of Perez.   </li>
Mahalath	<p>a lute; lyre. </p><li> The daughter of Ishmael, and third wife of Esau ( Genesis 28:9 ); called also Bashemath ( Genesis 36:3 ).  </li><li> The daughter of Jerimoth, who was one of David's sons. She was one of Rehoboam's wives ( 2 Chronicles 11:18 ).   </li>
Mahalath Leannoth Maschil	<p>This word leannoth seems to point to some kind of instrument unknown ( Psalms 88 , title). The whole phrase has by others been rendered, "On the sickness of affliction: a lesson;" or, "Concerning afflictive sickness: a didactic psalm."  </p>
Mahalath Maschil	<p>in the title of  Psalms 53 , denoting that this was a didactic psalm, to be sung to the accompaniment of the lute or guitar. Others regard this word "mahalath" as the name simply of an old air to which the psalm was to be sung. Others, again, take the word as meaning "sickness," and regard it as alluding to the contents of the psalm.  </p>
Mahanaim	<p>two camps, a place near the Jabbok, beyond Jordan, where Jacob was met by the "angels of God," and where he divided his retinue into "two hosts" on his return from Padan-aram ( Genesis 32:2 ). This name was afterwards given to the town which was built at that place. It was the southern boundary of Bashan ( Joshua 13:26 Joshua 13:30 ), and became a city of the Levites ( 21:38 ). Here Saul's son Ishbosheth reigned ( 2 Samuel 2:8 2 Samuel 2:12 ), while David reigned at Hebron. Here also, after a troubled reign, Ishbosheth was murdered by two of his own bodyguard ( 2 Samuel 4:5-7 ), who brought his head to David at Hebron, but were, instead of being rewarded, put to death by him for their cold-blooded murder. Many years after this, when he fled from Jerusalem on the rebellion of his son Absalom, David made Mahanaim, where Barzillai entertained him, his headquarters, and here he mustered his forces which were led against the army that had gathered around Absalom. It was while sitting at the gate of this town that tidings of the great and decisive battle between the two hosts and of the death of his son Absalom reached him, when he gave way to the most violent grief ( 2 Samuel 17:24-27 ).  </p><p> The only other reference to Mahanaim is as a station of one of Solomon's purveyors ( 1 Kings 4:14 ). It has been identified with the modern Mukhumah, a ruin found in a depressed plain called el-Bukie'a, "the little vale," near Penuel, south of the Jabbok, and north-east of es-Salt.  </p>
Mahaneh-dan	<p> Judges 18:12  = "camp of Dan"  13:25  (RSV, "Mahaneh-dan"), a place behind (i.e., west of) Kirjath-jearim, where the six hundred Danites from Zorah and Eshtaol encamped on their way to capture the city of Laish, which they rebuilt and called "Dan, after the name of their father" ( 18:11-31 ). The Palestine Explorers point to a ruin called 'Erma, situated about 3 miles from the great corn valley on the east of Samson's home.  </p>
Mahath	<p>grasping. </p><li> A Kohathite Levite, father of Elkanah ( 1 Chronicles 6:35 ).  </li><li> Another Kohathite Levite, of the time of Hezekiah ( 2 Chronicles 29:12 ).   </li>
Mahazioth	<p>visions, a Kohathite Levite, chief of the twenty-third course of musicians ( 1 Chronicles 25:4 1 Chronicles 25:30 ).  </p>
Maher-shalal-hash-baz	<p>plunder speedeth; spoil hasteth, ( Isaiah 8:1-3 ; Compare  Zephaniah 1:14 ), a name Isaiah was commanded first to write in large characters on a tablet, and afterwards to give as a symbolical name to a son that was to be born to him ( Isaiah 8:1 Isaiah 8:3 ), as denoting the sudden attack on Damascus and Syria by the Assyrian army.  </p>
Mahlah	<p>disease, one of the five daughters of Zelophehad ( Numbers 27:1-11 ) who had their father's inheritance, the law of inheritance having been altered in their favour.  </p>
Mahlon	<p>sickly, the elder of Elimelech the Bethlehemite's two sons by Naomi. He married Ruth and died childless ( Ruth 1:2 Ruth 1:5 ;  Ruth 4:9 Ruth 4:10 ), in the land of Moab.  </p>
Mahol	<p>dance, the father of four sons ( 1 Kings 4:31 ) who were inferior in wisdom only to Solomon.  </p>
Mail, Coat of	<p>"a corselet of scales," a cuirass formed of pieces of metal overlapping each other, like fish-scales ( 1 Samuel 17:5 ); also (38) a corselet or garment thus encased.  </p>
Main-sail	<p>(Gr. artemon), answering to the modern "mizzen-sail," as some suppose. Others understand the "jib," near the prow, or the "fore-sail," as likely to be most useful in bringing a ship's head to the wind in the circumstances described ( Acts 27:40 ).  </p>
Makheloth	<p>assemblies, a station of the Israelites in the desert ( Numbers 33:25 Numbers 33:26 ).  </p>
Makkedah	<p>herdsman's place, one of the royal cities of the Canaanites ( Joshua 12:16 ), near which was a cave where the five kings who had confederated against Israel sought refuge ( 10:10-29 ). They were put to death by Joshua, who afterwards suspended their bodies upon five trees. It has been identified with the modern village called Sumeil, standing on a low hill about 7 miles to the north-west of Eleutheropolis (Beit Jibrin), where are ancient remains and a great cave. The Palestine Exploration surveyors have, however, identified it with el-Mughar, or "the caves," 3 miles from Jabneh and 2 1/2 southwest of Ekron, because, they say, "at this site only of all possible sites for Makkedah in the Palestine plain do caves still exist." (See ADONI-ZEDEC.)  </p>
Maktesh	<p>mortar, a place in or near Jerusalem inhabited by silver merchants ( Zephaniah 1:11 ). It has been conjectured that it was the "Phoenician quarter" of the city, where the traders of that nation resided, after the Oriental custom.  </p>
Malachi	<p>messenger or angel, the last of the minor prophets, and the writer of the last book of the Old Testament canon ( Malachi 4:4 Malachi 4:5 Malachi 4:6 ). Nothing is known of him beyond what is contained in his book of prophecies. Some have supposed that the name is simply a title descriptive of his character as a messenger of Jehovah, and not a proper name. There is reason, however, to conclude that Malachi was the ordinary name of the prophet.  </p><p> He was contemporary with Nehemiah (Compare  Malachi 2:8  with  Nehemiah 13:15 ;  Malachi 2:10-16  with  Nehemiah 13:23 ). No allusion is made to him by Ezra, and he does not mention the restoration of the temple, and hence it is inferred that he prophesied after Haggai and Zechariah, and when the temple services were still in existence ( Malachi 1:10 ;  Malachi 3:1 Malachi 3:10 ). It is probable that he delivered his prophecies about B.C. 420, after the second return of Nehemiah from Persia ( Nehemiah 13:6 ), or possibly before his return.  </p>
Malachi, Prophecies of	<p>The contents of the book are comprised in four chapters. In the Hebrew text the third and fourth chapters (of the A.V.) form but one. The whole consists of three sections, preceded by an introduction ( Malachi 1:1-5 ), in which the prophet reminds Israel of Jehovah's love to them. The first section ( (1:6-2:9) ) contains a stern rebuke addressed to the priests who had despised the name of Jehovah, and been leaders in a departure from his worship and from the covenant, and for their partiality in administering the law. In the second ( 2:9-16 ) the people are rebuked for their intermarriages with idolatrous heathen. In the third ( (2:17-4:6) ) he addresses the people as a whole, and warns them of the coming of the God of judgment, preceded by the advent of the Messiah.  </p><p> This book is frequently referred to in the New Testament ( Matthew 11:10 ;  17:12 ;  Mark 1:2 ;  Mark 9:11 Mark 9:12 ;  Luke 1:17 ;  Romans 9:13 ).  </p>
Malcam	<p>( 2 Samuel 12:30 , Heb., RSV, "their king;"  Jeremiah 49:1 Jeremiah 49:3 , RSV;  Zephaniah 1:5 ), the national idol of the Ammonites. When Rabbah was taken by David, the crown of this idol was among the spoils. The weight is said to have been "a talent of gold" (above 100 lbs.). The expression probably denotes its value rather than its weight. It was adorned with precious stones.  </p>
Malchiah	<p>Jehovah's king. </p><li> The head of the fifth division of the priests in the time of David ( 1 Chronicles 24:9 ).  </li><li> A priest, the father of Pashur ( 1 Chronicles 9:12 ;  Jeremiah 38:1 ).  </li><li> One of the priests appointed as musicians to celebrate the completion of the walls of Jerusalem ( Nehemiah 12:42 ).  </li><li> A priest who stood by Ezra when he "read in the book of the law of God" ( Nehemiah 8:4 ).  </li><li> Nehemiah 3:11 .  </li><li> Nehemiah 3:31 .  </li><li> Nehemiah 3:14 .   </li>
Malchi-shua	<p>king of help, one of the four sons of Saul ( 1 Chronicles 8:33 ). He perished along with his father in the battle of Gilboa ( 1 Samuel 31:2 ).  </p>
Malchus	<p>reigning, the personal servant or slave of the high priest Caiaphas. He is mentioned only by John. Peter cut off his right ear in the garden of Gethsemane ( John 18:10 ). But our Lord cured it with a touch ( Matthew 26:51 ;  Mark 14:47 ;  Luke 22:51 ). This was the last miracle of bodily cure wrought by our Lord. It is not mentioned by John.  </p>
Mallothi	<p>my fulness, a Kohathite Levite, one of the sons of Heman the Levite ( 1 Chronicles 25:4 ), and chief of the nineteenth division of the temple musicians (26).  </p>
Mallows	<p>occurs only in  Job 30:4  (RSV, "saltwort"). The word so rendered (malluah, from melah, "salt") most probably denotes the Atriplex halimus of Linnaeus, a species of sea purslane found on the shores of the Dead Sea, as also of the Mediterranean, and in salt marshes. It is a tall shrubby orach, growing to the height sometimes of 10 feet. Its buds and leaves, with those of other saline plants, are eaten by the poor in Palestine.  </p>
Malluch	<p>reigned over, or reigning. </p><li> A Levite of the family of Merari ( 1 Chronicles 6:44 ).  </li><li> A priest who returned from Babylon ( Nehemiah 12:2 ).  </li><li> Ezra 10:29 . </li><li> Ezra 10:32  </li>
Mammon	<p>a Chaldee or Syriac word meaning "wealth" or "riches" ( Luke 16:9-11 ); also, by personification, the god of riches ( Matthew 6:24 ;  Luke 16:9-11 ).  </p>
Mamre	<p>manliness. </p><li> An Amoritish chief in alliance with Abraham ( Genesis 14:13 Genesis 14:24 ).  </li><li> The name of the place in the neighbourhood of Hebron (q.v.) where Abraham dwelt ( Genesis 23:17 Genesis 23:19 ;  35:27 ); called also in Authorized Version ( 13:18 ) the "plain of Mamre," but in Revised Version more correctly "the oaks [marg., 'terebinths'] of Mamre." The name probably denotes the "oak grove" or the "wood of Mamre," thus designated after Abraham's ally.  <p> This "grove" must have been within sight of or "facing" Machpelah (q.v.). The site of Mamre has been identified with Ballatet Selta, i.e., "the oak of rest", where there is a tree called "Abraham's oak," about a mile and a half west of Hebron. Others identify it with er-Rameh, 2 miles north of Hebron.  </p> </li>
Man	<p></p><li> Heb. 'Adam, used as the proper name of the first man. The name is derived from a word meaning "to be red," and thus the first man was called Adam because he was formed from the red earth. It is also the generic name of the human race ( Genesis 1:26 Genesis 1:27 ;  5:2 ;  8:21 ;  Deuteronomy 8:3 ). Its equivalents are the Latin homo and the Greek anthropos ( Matthew 5:13 Matthew 5:16 ). It denotes also man in opposition to woman ( Genesis 3:12 ;  Matthew 19:10 ).  </li><li> Heb. 'ish, like the Latin vir and Greek aner, denotes properly a man in opposition to a woman ( 1 Samuel 17:33 ;  Matthew 14:21 ); a husband ( Genesis 3:16 ;  Hosea 2:16 ); man with reference to excellent mental qualities.  </li><li> Heb. 'enosh, man as mortal, transient, perishable ( 2 Chronicles 14:11 ;  Isaiah 8:1 ;  Job 15:14 ;  Psalms 8:4 ;  Psalms 9:19 Psalms 9:20 ;  103:15 ). It is applied to women ( Joshua 8:25 ).  </li><li> Heb. geber, man with reference to his strength, as distinguished from women ( Deuteronomy 22:5 ) and from children ( Exodus 12:37 ); a husband ( Proverbs 6:34 ).  </li><li> Heb. methim, men as mortal ( Isaiah 41:14 ), and as opposed to women and children ( Deuteronomy 3:6 ;  Job 11:3 ;  Isaiah 3:25 ).  <p> Man was created by the immediate hand of God, and is generically different from all other creatures ( Genesis 1:26 Genesis 1:27 ;  2:7 ). His complex nature is composed of two elements, two distinct substances, viz., body and soul ( Genesis 2:7 ; Eccl  12:7 ;  2 co  5:1-8 ).  </p><p> The words translated "spirit" and "soul," in  1 Thessalonians 5:23 ,  Hebrews 4:12 , are habitually used interchangeably ( Matthew 10:28 ;  16:26 ;  1 Peter 1:22 ). The "spirit" (Gr. pneuma) is the soul as rational; the "soul" (Gr. psuche) is the same, considered as the animating and vital principle of the body.  </p><p> Man was created in the likeness of God as to the perfection of his nature, in knowledge ( Colossians 3:10 ), righteousness, and holiness ( Ephesians 4:24 ), and as having dominion over all the inferior creatures ( Genesis 1:28 ). He had in his original state God's law written on his heart, and had power to obey it, and yet was capable of disobeying, being left to the freedom of his own will. He was created with holy dispositions, prompting him to holy actions; but he was fallible, and did fall from his integrity ( 3:1-6 ). (See FALL .) </p> </li>
Man of sin	<p>a designation of Antichrist given in  2 Thessalonians 2:3-10 , usually regarded as descriptive of the Papal power; but "in whomsoever these distinctive features are found, whoever wields temporal and spiritual power in any degree similar to that in which the man of sin is here described as wielding it, he, be he pope or potentate, is beyond all doubt a distinct type of Antichrist."  </p>[J] indicates this entry was also found in Jack Van Impe's Prophecy Dictionary<br/>
Manaen	<p>consoler, a Christian teacher at Antioch. Nothing else is known of him beyond what is stated in  Acts 13:1 , where he is spoken of as having been brought up with (Gr. syntrophos; rendered in RSV "foster brother" of) Herod, i.e., Herod Antipas, the tetrach, who, with his brother Archelaus, was educated at Rome.  </p>
Manasseh	<p>who makes to forget. "God hath made me forget" (Heb. nashshani),  Genesis 41:51 . </p><li> The elder of the two sons of Joseph. He and his brother Ephraim were afterwards adopted by Jacob as his own sons ( 48:1 ). There is an account of his marriage to a Syrian ( 1 Chronicles 7:14 ); and the only thing afterwards recorded of him is, that his grandchildren were "brought up upon Joseph's knees" ( Genesis 50:23 ; RSV, "born upon Joseph's knees") i.e., were from their birth adopted by Joseph as his own children.  <p> The tribe of Manasseh was associated with that of Ephraim and Benjamin during the wanderings in the wilderness. They encamped on the west side of the tabernacle. According to the census taken at Sinai, this tribe then numbered 32,200 ( Numbers 1:10 Numbers 1:35 ;  Numbers 2:20 Numbers 2:21 ). Forty years afterwards its numbers had increased to 52,700 ( Numbers 26:34 Numbers 26:37 ), and it was at this time the most distinguished of all the tribes.  </p><p> The half of this tribe, along with Reuben and Gad, had their territory assigned them by Moses on the east of the Jordan ( Joshua 13:7-14 ); but it was left for Joshua to define the limits of each tribe. This territory on the east of Jordan was more valuable and of larger extent than all that was allotted to the nine and a half tribes in the land of Palestine. It is sometimes called "the land of Gilead," and is also spoken of as "on the other side of Jordan." The portion given to the half tribe of Manasseh was the largest on the east of Jordan. It embraced the whole of Bashan. It was bounded on the south by Mahanaim, and extended north to the foot of Lebanon. Argob, with its sixty cities, that "ocean of basaltic rocks and boulders tossed about in the wildest confusion," lay in the midst of this territory.  </p><p> The whole "land of Gilead" having been conquered, the two and a half tribes left their wives and families in the fortified cities there, and accompanied the other tribes across the Jordan, and took part with them in the wars of conquest. The allotment of the land having been completed, Joshua dismissed the two and a half tribes, commending them for their heroic service ( Joshua 22:1-34 ). Thus dismissed, they returned over Jordan to their own inheritance. (See ED .) </p><p> On the west of Jordan the other half of the tribe of Manasseh was associated with Ephraim, and they had their portion in the very centre of Palestine, an area of about 1,300 square miles, the most valuable part of the whole country, abounding in springs of water. Manasseh's portion was immediately to the north of that of Ephraim ( Joshua 16 ). Thus the western Manasseh defended the passes of Esdraelon as the eastern kept the passes of the Hauran.  </p></li><li> The only son and successor of Hezekiah on the throne of Judah. He was twelve years old when he began to reign ( 2 Kings 21:1 ), and he reigned fifty-five years (B.C. 698-643). Though he reigned so long, yet comparatively little is known of this king. His reign was a continuation of that of Ahaz, both in religion and national polity. He early fell under the influence of the heathen court circle, and his reign was characterized by a sad relapse into idolatry with all its vices, showing that the reformation under his father had been to a large extent only superficial ( Isaiah 7:10 ;  2 Kings  21:10-15 ). A systematic and persistent attempt was made, and all too successfully, to banish the worship of Jehovah out of the land. Amid this wide-spread idolatry there were not wanting, however, faithful prophets (Isaiah, Micah) who lifted up their voice in reproof and in warning. But their fidelity only aroused bitter hatred, and a period of cruel persecution against all the friends of the old religion began. "The days of Alva in Holland, of Charles IX. in France, or of the Covenanters under Charles II. in Scotland, were anticipated in the Jewish capital. The streets were red with blood." There is an old Jewish tradition that Isaiah was put to death at this time ( 2 Kings 21:16 ;  2 Kings 24:3 2 Kings 24:4 ;  Jeremiah 2:30 ), having been sawn asunder in the trunk of a tree.  Psalms 497377140 ,73,77,140, and 141 seem to express the feelings of the pious amid the fiery trials of this great persecution. Manasseh has been called the "Nero of Palestine."  <p> Esarhaddon, Sennacherib's successor on the Assyrian throne, who had his residence in Babylon for thirteen years (the only Assyrian monarch who ever reigned in Babylon), took Manasseh prisoner (B.C. 681) to Babylon. Such captive kings were usually treated with great cruelty. They were brought before the conqueror with a hook or ring passed through their lips or their jaws, having a cord attached to it, by which they were led. This is referred to in  2 Chronicles 33:11 , where the Authorized Version reads that Esarhaddon "took Manasseh among the thorns;" while the Revised Version renders the words, "took Manasseh in chains;" or literally, as in the margin, "with hooks." (Compare  2 Kings 19:28 .)  </p><p> The severity of Manasseh's imprisonment brought him to repentance. God heard his cry, and he was restored to his kingdom ( 2 Chronicles 33:11-13 ). He abandoned his idolatrous ways, and enjoined the people to worship Jehovah; but there was no thorough reformation. After a lengthened reign extending through fifty-five years, the longest in the history of Judah, he died, and was buried in the garden of Uzza, the "garden of his own house" ( 2 Kings 21:17 2 Kings 21:18 ;  2 Chr  33:20 ), and not in the city of David, among his ancestors. He was succeeded by his son Amon.  </p><p> In  Judges 18:30  the correct reading is "Moses," and not "Manasseh." The name "Manasseh" is supposed to have been introduced by some transcriber to avoid the scandal of naming the grandson of Moses the great lawgiver as the founder of an idolatrous religion.  </p> </li>
Mandrakes	<p>Hebrew dudaim; i.e., "love-plants", occurs only in  Genesis 30:14-16  and Cant  7:13 . Many interpretations have been given of this word <i> dudaim</i> . It has been rendered "violets," "Lilies," "jasmines," "truffles or mushrooms," "flowers," the "citron," etc. The weight of authority is in favour of its being regarded as the Mandragora officinalis of botanists, "a near relative of the night-shades, the 'apple of Sodom' and the potato plant." It possesses stimulating and narcotic properties ( Genesis 30:14-16 ). The fruit of this plant resembles the potato-apple in size, and is of a pale orange colour. It has been called the "love-apple." The Arabs call it "Satan's apple." It still grows near Jerusalem, and in other parts of Palestine.  </p>
Maneh	<p>portion ( Ezekiel 45:12 ), rendered "pound" ( 1 Kings 10:17 ;  Ezra 2:69 ;  Nehemiah 7:71 Nehemiah 7:72 ), a weight variously estimated, probably about 2 1/2 or 3 lbs. A maneh of gold consisted of a hundred common shekels (q.v.). (Compare  1 Kings 10:17 , and  2 Chronicles 9:16 ).  </p>
Manger	<p>( Luke 2:7 Luke 2:12 Luke 2:16 ), the name (Gr. phatne, rendered "stall" in  Luke 13:15 ) given to the place where the infant Redeemer was laid. It seems to have been a stall or crib for feeding cattle. Stables and mangers in our modern sense were in ancient times unknown in the East. The word here properly denotes "the ledge or projection in the end of the room used as a stall on which the hay or other food of the animals of travellers was placed." (See INN .) </p>
Manna	<p>Heb. man-hu, "What is that?" the name given by the Israelites to the food miraculously supplied to them during their wanderings in the wilderness ( Exodus 16:15-35 ). The name is commonly taken as derived from <i> man</i> , an expression of surprise, "What is it?" but more probably it is derived from <i> manan</i> , meaning "to allot," and hence denoting an "allotment" or a "gift." This "gift" from God is described as "a small round thing," like the "hoar-frost on the ground," and "like coriander seed," "of the colour of bdellium," and in taste "like wafers made with honey." It was capable of being baked and boiled, ground in mills, or beaten in a mortar ( Exodus 16:23 ;  Numbers 11:7 ). If any was kept over till the following morning, it became corrupt with worms; but as on the Sabbath none fell, on the preceding day a double portion was given, and that could be kept over to supply the wants of the Sabbath without becoming corrupt. Directions concerning the gathering of it are fully given ( Exodus 16:16-18 Exodus 16:33 ;  Deuteronomy 8:3 Deuteronomy 8:16 ). It fell for the first time after the eighth encampment in the desert of Sin, and was daily furnished, except on the Sabbath, for all the years of the wanderings, till they encamped at Gilgal, after crossing the Jordan, when it suddenly ceased, and where they "did eat of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more" ( Joshua 5:12 ). They now no longer needed the "bread of the wilderness."  </p><p> This manna was evidently altogether a miraculous gift, wholly different from any natural product with which we are acquainted, and which bears this name. The manna of European commerce comes chiefly from Calabria and Sicily. It drops from the twigs of a species of ash during the months of June and July. At night it is fluid and resembles dew, but in the morning it begins to harden. The manna of the Sinaitic peninsula is an exudation from the "manna-tamarisk" tree (Tamarix mannifera), the el-tarfah of the Arabs. This tree is found at the present day in certain well-watered valleys in the peninsula of Sinai. The manna with which the people of Israel were fed for forty years differs in many particulars from all these natural products. </p><p> Our Lord refers to the manna when he calls himself the "true bread from heaven" ( John 6:31-35 ;  4851 -51). He is also the "hidden manna" ( Revelation 2:17 ; Compare  John 6:49 John 6:51 ).  </p>
Manoah	<p>rest, a Danite, the father of Samson ( Judges 13:1-22 , and  14:2-4 ).  </p>
Manslayer	<p>one who was guilty of accidental homicide, and was entitled to flee to a city of refuge ( Numbers 35:6 Numbers 35:12 Numbers 35:22 Numbers 35:23 ), his compulsory residence in which terminated with the death of the high priest. (See CITY OF  REFUGE .) </p>
Mantle	<p></p><li> Heb. 'addereth, a large over-garment. This word is used of Elijah's mantle ( 1 Kings 19:13 1 Kings 19:19 ;  2 Kings  1 Kings 2:8 1 Kings 2:13 , etc.), which was probably a sheepskin. It appears to have been his only garment, a strip of skin or leather binding it to his loins. <i> 'Addereth</i> twice occurs with the epithet "hairy" ( Genesis 25:25 ;  Zechariah 13:4 , RSV). It is the word denoting the "goodly Babylonish garment" which Achan coveted ( Joshua 7:21 ).  </li><li> Heb. me'il, frequently applied to the "robe of the ephod" ( Exodus 28:4 Exodus 28:31 ;  Leviticus 8:7 ), which was a splendid under tunic wholly of blue, reaching to below the knees. It was woven without seam, and was put on by being drawn over the head. It was worn not only by priests but by kings ( 1 Samuel 24:4 ), prophets ( 15:27 ), and rich men ( Job 1:20 ;  2:12 ). This was the "little coat" which Samuel's mother brought to him from year to year to Shiloh ( 1 Samuel 2:19 ), a miniature of the official priestly robe.  </li><li> Semikah, "a rug," the garment which Jael threw as a covering over Sisera ( Judges 4:18 ). The Hebrew word occurs nowhere else in Scripture.  </li><li> Maataphoth, plural, only in  Isaiah 3:22 , denoting a large exterior tunic worn by females. (See DRESS .)  </li>
Maoch	<p>compressed, the father of Achish, king of Gath ( 1 Samuel 27:2 ). Called also Maachah ( 1 Kings 2:39 ).  </p>
Maon	<p>habitation, a town in the tribe of Judah, about 7 miles south of Hebron, which gave its name to the wilderness, the district round the conical hill on which the town stood. Here David hid from Saul, and here Nabal had his possessions and his home ( 1 Samuel 23:24 1 Samuel 23:25 ;  25:2 ). "Only some small foundations of hewn stone, a square enclosure, and several cisterns are now to be seen at Maon. Are they the remains of Nabal's great establishment?" The hill is now called Tell M'ain.  </p>
Mara	<p>bitter; sad, a symbolical name which Naomi gave to herself because of her misfortunes ( Ruth 1:20 ).  </p>
Marah	<p>bitterness, a fountain at the sixth station of the Israelites ( Exodus 15:23 Exodus 15:24 ;  Numbers 33:8 ) whose waters were so bitter that they could not drink them. On this account they murmured against Moses, who, under divine direction, cast into the fountain "a certain tree" which took away its bitterness, so that the people drank of it. This was probably the 'Ain Hawarah, where there are still several springs of water that are very "bitter," distant some 47 miles from 'Ayun Mousa.  </p>
Maralah	<p>trembling, a place on the southern boundary of Zebulun ( Joshua 19:11 ). It has been identified with the modern M'alul, about 4 miles south-west of Nazareth.  </p>
Maranatha	<p>( 1 Corinthians 16:22 ) consists of two Aramean words, Maran'athah, meaning, "our Lord comes," or is "coming." If the latter interpretation is adopted, the meaning of the phrase is, "Our Lord is coming, and he will judge those who have set him at nought." (Compare Phil  4:5 ;  James 5:8 James 5:9 .)  </p>
Marble	<p>as a mineral, consists of carbonate of lime, its texture varying from the highly crystalline to the compact. In  Esther 1:6  there are four Hebrew words which are rendered marble:, </p><li> Shesh, "pillars of marble." But this word probably designates dark-blue limestone rather than marble. </li><li> Dar, some regard as Parian marble. It is here rendered "white marble." But nothing is certainly known of it. </li><li> Bahat, "red marble," probably the verd-antique or half-porphyry of Egypt. </li><li> Sohareth, "black marble," probably some spotted variety of marble. "The marble pillars and tesserae of various colours of the palace at Susa came doubtless from Persia itself, where marble of various colours is found, especially in the province of Hamadan Susiana." The marble of Solomon's architectural works may have been limestone from near Jerusalem, or from Lebanon, or possibly white marble from Arabia. Herod employed Parian marble in the temple, and marble columns still exist in great abundance at Jerusalem.   </li>
Marcheshvan	<p>the post-biblical name of the month which was the eighth of the sacred and the second of the civil year of the Jews. It began with the new moon of our November. It is once called Bul ( 1 Kings 6:38 ). Assyrian, Arah Samna, "eighth month,"  </p>
Marcus	<p> Colossians 4:10 ;  Philemon 1:24 ;  1 Peter 5:13 ; RSV, "Mark" (q.v.).  </p>
Mareshah	<p>possession, a city in the plain of Judah ( John 15:44 ). Here Asa defeated Zerah the Ethiopian ( 2 Chronicles 14:9 2 Chronicles 14:10 ). It is identified with the ruin el-Mer'ash, about 1 1/2 mile south of Beit Jibrin.  </p>
Mark	<p>the evangelist; "John whose surname was Mark" ( Acts 12:12 Acts 12:25 ). Mark (Marcus,  Colossians 4:10 , etc.) was his Roman name, which gradually came to supersede his Jewish name John. He is called John in  Acts 13:5 Acts 13:13 , and Mark in 15:39,2Tim  4:11 , etc.  </p><p> He was the son of Mary, a woman apparently of some means and influence, and was probably born in Jerusalem, where his mother resided ( Acts 12:12 ). Of his father we know nothing. He was cousin of Barnabas ( Colossians 4:10 ). It was in his mother's house that Peter found "many gathered together praying" when he was released from prison; and it is probable that it was here that he was converted by Peter, who calls him his "son" ( 1 Peter 5:13 ). It is probable that the "young man" spoken of in Mark 14:51,52was Mark himself. He is first mentioned in  Acts 12:25 . He went with Paul and Barnabas on their first journey (about A.D. 47) as their "minister," but from some cause turned back when they reached Perga in Pamphylia ( Acts 12:25 ;  13:13 ). Three years afterwards a "sharp contention" arose between Paul and Barnabas ( 15:36-40 ), because Paul would not take Mark with him. He, however, was evidently at length reconciled to the apostle, for he was with him in his first imprisonment at Rome ( Colossians 4:10 ;  Philemon 1:24 ). At a later period he was with Peter in Babylon ( 1 Peter 5:13 ), then, and for some centuries afterwards, one of the chief seats of Jewish learning; and he was with Timothy in Ephesus when Paul wrote him during his second imprisonment ( 2 Timothy 4:11 ). He then disappears from view.  </p>
Mark, Gospel according to	<p>It is the current and apparently well-founded tradition that Mark derived his information mainly from the discourses of Peter. In his mother's house he would have abundant opportunities of obtaining information from the other apostles and their coadjutors, yet he was "the disciple and interpreter of Peter" specially. </p><p> As to the time when it was written, the Gospel furnishes us with no definite information. Mark makes no mention of the destruction of Jerusalem, hence it must have been written before that event, and probably about A.D. 63.  </p><p> The place where it was written was probably Rome. Some have supposed Antioch (Compare  Mark 15:21  with  Acts 11:20 ).  </p><p> It was intended primarily for Romans. This appears probable when it is considered that it makes no reference to the Jewish law, and that the writer takes care to interpret words which a Gentile would be likely to misunderstand, such as, "Boanerges" ( 3:17 ); "Talitha cumi" ( 5:41 ); "Corban" ( 7:11 ); "Bartimaeus" ( 10:46 ); "Abba" ( <span class="badLink">14:36</span> ); "Eloi," etc. ( <span class="badLink">15:34</span> ). Jewish usages are also explained ( 7:3 ;  14:3 ;  14:12 ;  <span class="badLink">15:42</span> ). Mark also uses certain Latin words not found in any of the other Gospels, as "speculator" ( <span class="badLink">6:27</span> , rendered, A.V., "executioner;" RSV, "soldier of his guard"), "xestes" (a corruption of sextarius, rendered "pots,"  Acts 7:4 Acts 7:8 ), "quadrans" ( <span class="badLink">12:42</span> , rendered "a farthing"), "centurion" ( Acts 15:39  Acts 15:44  <span class="badLink">Acts 15:45</span> ). He only twice quotes from the Old Testament ( 1:2 ;  15:28 ).  </p><p> The characteristics of this Gospel are, (1) the absence of the genealogy of our Lord, (2) whom he represents as clothed with power, the "lion of the tribe of Judah." </p><li> Mark also records with wonderful minuteness the very words ( 3:17 ;  5:41 ;  Acts 7:11 Acts 7:34 ;  <span class="badLink">14:36</span> ) as well as the position ( 9:35 ) and gestures ( Acts 3:5 <span class="badLink">Acts 3:34</span> ;  5:32 ;  9:36 ;  10:16 ) of our Lord. </li><li> He is also careful to record particulars of person ( <span class="badLink">Acts 1:29</span> <span class="badLink">Acts 1:36</span> ;  Acts 3:6 Acts 3:22 , etc.), number ( 5:13 ;  6:7 , etc.), place ( 2:13 ;  4:1 ;  7:31 , etc.), and time ( <span class="badLink">1:35</span> ;  2:1 ;  4:35 , etc.), which the other evangelists omit. </li><li> The phrase "and straightway" occurs nearly forty times in this Gospel; while in Luke's Gospel, which is much longer, it is used only seven times, and in John only four times.  <p> "The Gospel of Mark," says Westcott, "is essentially a transcript from life. The course and issue of facts are imaged in it with the clearest outline." "In Mark we have no attempt to draw up a continuous narrative. His Gospel is a rapid succession of vivid pictures loosely strung together without much attempt to bind them into a whole or give the events in their natural sequence. This pictorial power is that which specially characterizes this evangelist, so that 'if any one desires to know an evangelical fact, not only in its main features and grand results, but also in its most minute and so to speak more graphic delineation, he must betake himself to Mark.'" The leading principle running through this Gospel may be expressed in the motto: "Jesus came...preaching the gospel of the kingdom" ( Mark 1:14 ).  </p><p> "Out of a total of 662 verses, Mark has 406 in common with Matthew and Luke, 145 with Matthew, 60 with Luke, and at most 51 peculiar to itself." (See MATTHEW .) </p> </li>
Market-place	<p>any place of public resort, and hence a public place or broad street ( Matthew 11:16 ;  20:3 ), as well as a forum or market-place proper, where goods were exposed for sale, and where public assemblies and trials were held ( Acts 16:19 ;  17:17 ). This word occurs in the Old Testament only in  Ezekiel 27:13 .  </p><p> In early times markets were held at the gates of cities, where commodities were exposed for sale ( 2 Kings 7:18 ). In large towns the sale of particular articles seems to have been confined to certain streets, as we may infer from such expressions as "the bakers' street" ( Jeremiah 37:21 ), and from the circumstance that in the time of Josephus the valley between Mounts Zion and Moriah was called the Tyropoeon or the "valley of the cheesemakers."  </p>
Maroth	<p>bitterness; i.e., "perfect grief", a place not far from Jerusalem; mentioned in connection with the invasion of the Assyrian army ( Micah 1:12 ).  </p>
Marriage	<p>was instituted in Paradise when man was in innocence ( Genesis 2:18-24 ). Here we have its original charter, which was confirmed by our Lord, as the basis on which all regulations are to be framed ( Matthew 19:4 Matthew 19:5 ). It is evident that monogamy was the original law of marriage ( Matthew 19:5 ;  1 Corinthians 6:16 ). This law was violated in after times, when corrupt usages began to be introduced ( Genesis 4:19 ;  6:2 ). We meet with the prevalence of polygamy and concubinage in the patriarchal age ( Genesis 16:1-4 ;  22:21-24 ;  Genesis 28:8 Genesis 28:9 ;  29:23-30 , etc.). Polygamy was acknowledged in the Mosaic law and made the basis of legislation, and continued to be practised all down through the period of Jewish histroy to the Captivity, after which there is no instance of it on record.  </p><p> It seems to have been the practice from the beginning for fathers to select wives for their sons ( Genesis 24:3 ;  38:6 ). Sometimes also proposals were initiated by the father of the maiden ( Exodus 2:21 ). The brothers of the maiden were also sometimes consulted ( Genesis 24:51 ;  34:11 ), but her own consent was not required. The young man was bound to give a price to the father of the maiden ( 31:15 ;  34:12 ;  Exodus 22:16 Exodus 22:17 ;  1 Samuel 18:23 1 Samuel 18:25 ;  Ruth 4:10 ;  Hosea 3:2 ) On these patriarchal customs the Mosaic law made no change.  </p><p> In the pre-Mosaic times, when the proposals were accepted and the marriage price given, the bridegroom could come at once and take away his bride to his own house ( Genesis 24:63-67 ). But in general the marriage was celebrated by a feast in the house of the bride's parents, to which all friends were invited ( Genesis 29:22 Genesis 29:27 ); and on the day of the marriage the bride, concealed under a thick veil, was conducted to her future husband's home.  </p><p> Our Lord corrected many false notions then existing on the subject of marriage ( Matthew 22:23-30 ), and placed it as a divine institution on the highest grounds. The apostles state clearly and enforce the nuptial duties of husband and wife ( Ephesians 5:22-33 ;  Colossians 3:18 Colossians 3:19 ;  1 Peter 3:1-7 ). Marriage is said to be "honourable" ( Hebrews 13:4 ), and the prohibition of it is noted as one of the marks of degenerate times ( 1 Timothy 4:3 ).  </p><p> The marriage relation is used to represent the union between God and his people ( Isaiah 54:5 ;  Jeremiah 3:1-14 ;  Hosea 2:9 Hosea 2:20 ). In the New Testament the same figure is employed in representing the love of Christ to his saints ( Ephesians 5:25-27 ). The Church of the redeemed is the "Bride, the Lamb's wife" ( Revelation 19:7-9 ).  </p>
Marriage-feasts	<p>( John 2:1-11 ) "lasted usually for a whole week; but the cost of such prolonged rejoicing is very small in the East. The guests sit round the great bowl or bowls on the floor, the meal usually consisting of a lamb or kid stewed in rice or barley. The most honoured guests sit nearest, others behind; and all in eating dip their hand into the one smoking mound, pieces of the thin bread, bent together, serving for spoons when necessary. After the first circle have satisfied themselves, those lower in honour sit down to the rest, the whole company being men, for women are never seen at a feast. Water is poured on the hands before eating; and this is repeated when the meal closes, the fingers having first been wiped on pieces of bread, which, after serving the same purpose as table-napkins with us, are thrown on the ground to be eaten by any dog that may have stolen in from the streets through the ever-open door, or picked up by those outside when gathered and tossed out to them ( Matthew 15:27 ;  Mark 7:28 ). Rising from the ground and retiring to the seats round the walls, the guests then sit down cross-legged and gossip, or listen to recitals, or puzzle over riddles, light being scantily supplied by a small lamp or two, or if the night be chilly, by a smouldering fire of weeds kindled in the middle of the room, perhaps in a brazier, often in a hole in the floor. As to the smoke, it escapes as it best may; but indeed there is little of it, though enough to blacken the water or wine or milk skins hung up on pegs on the wall. (Compare  Psalms 119:83 .) To some such marriage-feast Jesus and his five disciples were invited at Cana of Galilee." Geikie's Life of Christ. (See CANA .) </p>
Mars Hill	<p>the Areopagus or rocky hill in Athens, north-west of the Acropolis, where the Athenian supreme tribunal and court of morals was held. From some part of this hill Paul delivered the address recorded in  Acts 17:22-31 . (See AREOPAGUS .) </p>
Martha	<p>bitterness, the sister of Lazarus and Mary, and probably the eldest of the family, who all resided at Bethany ( Luke 10:38 Luke 10:40 Luke 10:41 ;  John 11:1-39 ). From the residence being called "her house," some have supposed that she was a widow, and that her brother and sister lodged with her. She seems to have been of an anxious, bustling spirit, anxious to be helpful in providing the best things for the Master's use, in contrast to the quiet earnestness of Mary, who was more concerned to avail herself of the opportunity of sitting at his feet and learning of him. Afterwards at a supper given to Christ and his disciples in her house "Martha served." Nothing further is known of her.  </p><p> "Mary and Martha are representatives of two orders of human character. One was absorbed, preoccupied, abstracted; the other was concentrated and single-hearted. Her own world was the all of Martha; Christ was the first thought with Mary. To Martha life was 'a succession of particular businesses;' to Mary life 'was rather the flow of one spirit.' Martha was Petrine, Mary was Johannine. The one was a well-meaning, bustling busybody; the other was a reverent disciple, a wistful listener." Paul had such a picture as that of Martha in his mind when he spoke of serving the Lord "without distraction" ( 1 Corinthians 7:35 ).  </p>
Martyr	<p>one who bears witness of the truth, and suffers death in the cause of Christ ( Acts 22:20 ;  Revelation 2:13 ;  17:6 ). In this sense Stephen was the first martyr. The Greek word so rendered in all other cases is translated "witness." </p><li> In a court of justice ( Matthew 18:16 ;  26:65 ;  Acts 6:13 ;  7:58 ;  Hebrews 10:28 ;  1 Timothy 5:19 ). </li><li> As of one bearing testimony to the truth of what he has seen or known ( Luke 24:48 ;  Acts 1:8 Acts 1:22 ;  Romans 1:9 ;  1 Thessalonians 2:5 1 Thessalonians 2:10 ;  1 John 1:2 ).   </li>
Mary	<p>Hebrew Miriam. </p><li> The wife of Joseph, the mother of Jesus, called the "Virgin Mary," though never so designated in Scripture ( Matthew 2:11 ;  Acts 1:14 ). Little is known of her personal history. Her genealogy is given in  Luke 3 . She was of the tribe of Judah and the lineage of David ( Psalms 132:11 ;  Luke 1:32 ). She was connected by marriage with Elisabeth, who was of the lineage of Aaron ( Luke 1:36 ).  <p> While she resided at Nazareth with her parents, before she became the wife of Joseph, the angel Gabriel announced to her that she was to be the mother of the promised Messiah ( Luke 1:35 ). After this she went to visit her cousin Elisabeth, who was living with her husband Zacharias (probably at Juttah,  Joshua 15:55 ;  21:16 , in the neighbourhood of Maon), at a considerable distance, about 100 miles, from Nazareth. Immediately on entering the house she was saluted by Elisabeth as the mother of her Lord, and then forthwith gave utterance to her hymn of thanksgiving ( Luke 1:46-56 ; Compare  1 Samuel 2:1-10 ). After three months Mary returned to Nazareth to her own home. Joseph was supernaturally made aware ( Matthew 1:18-25 ) of her condition, and took her to his own home. Soon after this the decree of Augustus ( Luke 2:1 ) required that they should proceed to Bethlehem ( Micah 5:2 ), some 80 or 90 miles from Nazareth; and while they were there they found shelter in the inn or khan provided for strangers ( Luke 2:6 Luke 2:7 ). But as the inn was crowded, Mary had to retire to a place among the cattle, and there she brought forth her son, who was called Jesus ( Matthew 1:21 ), because he was to save his people from their sins. This was followed by the presentation in the temple, the flight into Egypt, and their return in the following year and residence at Nazareth ( Matthew 2 ). There for thirty years Mary, the wife of Joseph the carpenter, resides, filling her own humble sphere, and pondering over the strange things that had happened to her. During these years only one event in the history of Jesus is recorded, viz., his going up to Jerusalem when twelve years of age, and his being found among the doctors in the temple ( Luke 2:41-52 ). Probably also during this period Joseph died, for he is not again mentioned.  </p><p> After the commencement of our Lord's public ministry little notice is taken of Mary. She was present at the marriage in Cana. A year and a half after this we find her at Capernaum ( Matthew 12:46 Matthew 12:48 Matthew 12:49 ), where Christ uttered the memorable words, "Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!" The next time we find her is at the cross along with her sister Mary, and Mary Magdalene, and Salome, and other women ( John 19:26 ). From that hour John took her to his own abode. She was with the little company in the upper room after the Ascension ( Acts 1:14 ). From this time she wholly disappears from public notice. The time and manner of her death are unknown.  </p></li><li> Mary Magdalene, i.e., Mary of Magdala, a town on the western shore of the Lake of Tiberias. She is for the first time noticed in  Luke 8:3  as one of the women who "ministered to Christ of their substance." Their motive was that of gratitude for deliverances he had wrought for them. Out of Mary were cast seven demons. Gratitude to her great Deliverer prompted her to become his follower. These women accompanied him also on his last journey to Jerusalem ( Matthew 27:55 ;  Mark 15:41 ;  Luke 23:55 ). They stood near the cross. There Mary remained till all was over, and the body was taken down and laid in Joseph's tomb. Again, in the earliest dawn of the first day of the week she, with Salome and Mary the mother of James ( Matthew 28:1 ;  Mark 16:2 ), came to the sepulchre, bringing with them sweet spices, that they might anoint the body of Jesus. They found the sepulchre empty, but saw the "vision of angels" ( Matthew 28:5 ). She hastens to tell Peter and John, who were probably living together at this time ( John 20:1 John 20:2 ), and again immediately returns to the sepulchre. There she lingers thoughtfully, weeping at the door of the tomb. The risen Lord appears to her, but at first she knows him not. His utterance of her name "Mary" recalls her to consciousness, and she utters the joyful, reverent cry, "Rabboni." She would fain cling to him, but he forbids her, saying, "Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father." This is the last record regarding Mary of Magdala, who now returned to Jerusalem. The idea that this Mary was "the woman who was a sinner," or that she was unchaste, is altogether groundless.  </li><li> Mary the sister of Lazarus is brought to our notice in connection with the visits of our Lord to Bethany. She is contrasted with her sister Martha, who was "cumbered about many things" while Jesus was their guest, while Mary had chosen "the good part." Her character also appears in connection with the death of her brother ( John 11:20 John 11:31 John 11:33 ). On the occasion of our Lord's last visit to Bethany, Mary brought "a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus" as he reclined at table in the house of one Simon, who had been a leper ( Matthew 26:6 ;  Mark 14:3 ;  John 12:2 John 12:3 ). This was an evidence of her overflowing love to the Lord. Nothing is known of her subsequent history. It would appear from this act of Mary's, and from the circumstance that they possessed a family vault ( 11:38 ), and that a large number of Jews from Jerusalem came to condole with them on the death of Lazarus ( 11:19 ), that this family at Bethany belonged to the wealthier class of the people. (See MARTHA .) </li><li> Mary the wife of Cleopas is mentioned ( John 19:25 ) as standing at the cross in company with Mary of Magdala and Mary the mother of Jesus. By comparing  Matthew 27:56  and  Mark 15:40 , we find that this Mary and "Mary the mother of James the little" are on and the same person, and that she was the sister of our Lord's mother. She was that "other Mary" who was present with Mary of Magdala at the burial of our Lord ( Matthew 27:61 ;  Mark 15:47 ); and she was one of those who went early in the morning of the first day of the week to anoint the body, and thus became one of the first witnesses of the resurrection ( Matthew 28:1 ;  Mark 16:1 ;  Luke 24:1 ).  </li><li> Mary the mother of John Mark was one of the earliest of our Lord's disciples. She was the sister of Barnabas ( Colossians 4:10 ), and joined with him in disposing of their land and giving the proceeds of the sale into the treasury of the Church ( Acts 4:37 ;  12:12 ). Her house in Jerusalem was the common meeting-place for the disciples there.  </li><li> A Christian at Rome who treated Paul with special kindness ( Romans 16:6 ).   </li>
Maschil	<p>instructing, occurs in the title of thirteen Psalms (32,42,44, etc.). It denotes a song enforcing some lesson of wisdom or piety, a didactic song. In  Psalms 47:7  it is rendered, Authorized Version, "with understanding;" Revised Version, marg., "in a skilful psalm."  </p>
Mash	<p>(= Meshech  1 Chronicles 1:17 ), one of the four sons of Aram, and the name of a tribe descended from him ( Genesis 10:23 ) inhabiting some part probably of Mesopotamia. Some have supposed that they were the inhabitants of Mount Masius, the present Karja Baghlar, which forms part of the chain of Taurus.  </p>
Mashal	<p>entreaty, a levitical town in the tribe of Asher ( 1 Chronicles 6:74 ); called Mishal ( Joshua 21:30 ).  </p>
Mason	<p>an artificer in stone. The Tyrians seem to have been specially skilled in architecture ( 1 Kings 5:17 1 Kings 5:18 ;  2 Sam  5:11 ). This art the Hebrews no doubt learned in Egypt ( Exodus 1:11 Exodus 1:14 ), where ruins of temples and palaces fill the traveller with wonder at the present day.  </p>
Masrekah	<p>vineyard of noble vines, a place in Idumea, the native place of Samlah, one of the Edomitish kings ( Genesis 36:36 ;  1 Chronicles 1:47 ).  </p>
Massa	<p>a lifting up, gift, one of the sons of Ishmael, the founder of an Arabian tribe ( Genesis 25:14 ); a nomad tribe inhabiting the Arabian desert toward Babylonia.  </p>
Massah	<p>trial, temptation, a name given to the place where the Israelites, by their murmuring for want of water, provoked Jehovah to anger against them. It is also called Meribah ( Exodus 17:7 ;  Deuteronomy 6:16 ;  Psalms 95:8 Psalms 95:9 ;  Hebrews 3:8 ).  </p>
Mattan	<p>gift. </p><li> A priest of Baal, slain before his altar during the reformation under Jehoiada ( 2 Kings 11:18 ).  </li><li> The son of Eleazar, and father of Jacob, who was the father of Joseph, the husband of the Virgin Mary ( Matthew 1:15 ).  </li><li> The father of Shephatiah ( Jeremiah 38:1 ).   </li>
Mattanah	<p>a gift, a station of the Israelites ( Numbers 21:18 Numbers 21:19 ) between the desert and the borders of Moab, in the Wady Waleh.  </p>
Mattaniah	<p>gift of Jehovah. </p><li> A Levite, son of Heman, the chief of the ninth class of temple singers ( 1 Chronicles 25:4 1 Chronicles 25:16 ).  </li><li> A Levite who assisted in purifying the temple at the reformation under Hezekiah ( 2 Chronicles 29:13 ).  </li><li> The original name of Zedekiah (q.v.), the last of the kings of Judah ( 2 Kings 24:17 ). He was the third son of Josiah, who fell at Megiddo. He succeeded his nephew Jehoiakin.   </li>
Mattathias	<p>ibid. </p><li> The son of Amos, in the genealogy of our Lord ( Luke 3:25 ).  </li><li> The son of Semei, in the same genealogy ( Luke 3:26 ).   </li>
Matthan	<p>gift, one of our Lord's ancestry ( Matthew 1:15 ).  </p>
Matthat	<p>gift of God. </p><li> The son of Levi, and father of Heli ( Luke 3:24 ).  </li><li> Son of another Levi ( Luke 3:29 ).   </li>
Matthew	<p>gift of God, a common Jewish name after the Exile. He was the son of Alphaeus, and was a publican or tax-gatherer at Capernaum. On one occasion Jesus, coming up from the side of the lake, passed the custom-house where Matthew was seated, and said to him, "Follow me." Matthew arose and followed him, and became his disciple ( Matthew 9:9 ). Formerly the name by which he was known was Levi ( Mark 2:14 ;  Luke 5:27 ); he now changed it, possibly in grateful memory of his call, to Matthew. The same day on which Jesus called him he made a "great feast" ( Luke 5:29 ), a farewell feast, to which he invited Jesus and his disciples, and probably also many of old associates. He was afterwards selected as one of the twelve ( 6:15 ). His name does not occur again in the Gospel history except in the lists of the apostles. The last notice of him is in  Acts 1:13 . The time and manner of his death are unknown.  </p>
Matthew, Gospel according to	<p>The author of this book was beyond a doubt the Matthew, an apostle of our Lord, whose name it bears. He wrote the Gospel of Christ according to his own plans and aims, and from his own point of view, as did also the other "evangelists." </p><p> As to the time of its composition, there is little in the Gospel itself to indicate. It was evidently written before the destruction of Jerusalem ( Matthew 24 ), and some time after the events it records. The probability is that it was written between the years A.D. 60 and 65.  </p><p> The cast of thought and the forms of expression employed by the writer show that this Gospel was written for Jewish Christians of Palestine. His great object is to prove that Jesus of Nazareth was the promised Messiah, and that in him the ancient prophecies had their fulfilment. The Gospel is full of allusions to those passages of the Old Testament in which Christ is predicted and foreshadowed. The one aim prevading the whole book is to show that Jesus is he "of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write." This Gospel contains no fewer than sixty-five references to the Old Testament, forty-three of these being direct verbal citations, thus greatly outnumbering those found in the other Gospels. The main feature of this Gospel may be expressed in the motto, "I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil." </p><p> As to the language in which this Gospel was written there is much controversy. Many hold, in accordance with old tradition, that it was originally written in Hebrew (i.e., the Aramaic or Syro-Chaldee dialect, then the vernacular of the inhabitants of Palestine), and afterwards translated into Greek, either by Matthew himself or by some person unknown. This theory, though earnestly maintained by able critics, we cannot see any ground for adopting. From the first this Gospel in Greek was received as of authority in the Church. There is nothing in it to show that it is a translation. Though Matthew wrote mainly for the Jews, yet they were everywhere familiar with the Greek language. The same reasons which would have suggested the necessity of a translation into Greek would have led the evangelist to write in Greek at first. It is confessed that this Gospel has never been found in any other form than that in which we now possess it. </p><p> The leading characteristic of this Gospel is that it sets forth the kingly glory of Christ, and shows him to be the true heir to David's throne. It is the Gospel of the kingdom. Matthew uses the expression "kingdom of heaven" (thirty-two times), while Luke uses the expression "kingdom of God" (thirty-three times). Some Latinized forms occur in this Gospel, as kodrantes ( Matthew 5:26 ), for the Latin quadrans, and phragello ( 27:26 ), for the Latin flagello. It must be remembered that Matthew was a tax-gatherer for the Roman government, and hence in contact with those using the Latin language.  </p><p> As to the relation of the Gospels to each other, we must maintain that each writer of the synoptics (the first three) wrote independently of the other two, Matthew being probably first in point of time. </p><p> "Out of a total of 1071 verses, Matthew has 387 in common with Mark and Luke, 130 with Mark, 184 with Luke; only 387 being peculiar to itself." (See MARK; LUKE;  GOSPELS .) </p><p> The book is fitly divided into these four parts: </p><li> Containing the genealogy, the birth, and the infancy of Jesus (1; 2).  </li><li> The discourses and actions of John the Baptist preparatory to Christ's public ministry (3;  4:11 ).  </li><li> The discourses and actions of Christ in Galilee ( (4:12-20:16). ).  </li><li> The sufferings, death and resurrection of our Lord ( 20:17-28 ).   </li>
Matthias	<p>gift of God.  Acts 1:23 .  </p>
Mattithiah	<p>gift of Jehovah. </p><li> One of the sons of Jeduthun ( 1 Chronicles 25:3 1 Chronicles 25:21 ).  </li><li> The eldest son of Shallum, of the family of Korah ( 1 Chronicles 9:31 ).  </li><li> One who stood by Ezra while reading the law ( Nehemiah 8:4 ).  </li><li> The son of Amos, and father of Joseph, in the genealogy of our Lord ( Luke 3:25 ).   </li>
Mattock	<p></p><li> Heb. ma'eder, an instrument for dressing or pruning a vineyard ( Isaiah 7:25 ); a weeding-hoe.  </li><li> Heb. mahareshah ( 1 Samuel 13:1 ), perhaps the ploughshare or coulter.  </li><li> Heb. herebh, marg. of text ( 2 Chronicles 34:6 ). Authorized Version, "with their mattocks," marg. "mauls." The Revised Version renders "in their ruins," marg. "with their axes." The Hebrew text is probably corrupt.   </li>
Maul	<p>an old name for a mallet, the rendering of the Hebrew mephits ( Proverbs 25:18 ), properly a war-club.  </p>
Mazzaroth	<p>prognostications, found only  Job 38:32 , probably meaning "the twelve signs" (of the zodiac), as in the margin (Compare  2 Kings 23:5 ).  </p>
Meadow	<p></p><li> Heb. ha'ahu ( Genesis 41:2 Genesis 41:18 ), probably an Egyptain word transferred to the Hebrew; some kind of reed or water-plant. In the Revised Version it is rendered "reed-grass", i.e., the sedge or rank grass by the river side.  </li><li> Heb. ma'areh ( Judges 20:33 ), pl., "meadows of Gibeah" (RSV, after the LXX., "Maareh-geba"). Some have adopted the rendering "after Gibeah had been left open." The Vulgate translates the word "from the west."   </li>
Meah	<p>an hundred, a tower in Jersalem on the east wall ( Nehemiah 3:1 ) in the time of Nehemiah.  </p>
Meals	<p>are at the present day "eaten from a round table little higher than a stool, guests sitting cross-legged on mats or small carpets in a circle, and dipping their fingers into one large dish heaped with a mixture of boiled rice and other grain and meat. But in the time of our Lord, and perhaps even from the days of ( Amos 6:4 Amos 6:7 ), the foreign custom had been largely introduced of having broad couches, forming three sides of a small square, the guests reclining at ease on their elbows during meals, with their faces to the space within, up and down which servants passed offering various dishes, or in the absence of servants, helping themselves from dishes laid on a table set between the couches." Geikie's Life of Christ. (Compare  Luke 7:36-50 .) (See ABRAHAM'S BOSOM; BANQUET;  FEAST .) </p>
Mearah	<p>a cave, a place in the northern boundary of Palestine ( Joshua 13:4 ). This may be the cave of Jezzin in Lebanon, 10 miles east of Sidon, on the Damascus road; or probably, as others think, Mogheirizeh, north-east of Sidon.  </p>
Measure	<p>Several words are so rendered in the Authorized Version. </p><li> Those which are indefinite. (a) Hok,  Isaiah 5:14 , elsewhere "statute." (b) Mad,  Job 11:9 ;  Jeremiah 13:25 , elsewhere "garment." (c) Middah, the word most frequently thus translated,  Exodus 26:2 Exodus 26:8 , etc. (d) Mesurah,  Leviticus 19:35 ;  1 Chronicles 23:29 . (e) Mishpat,  Jeremiah 30:11 , elsewhere "judgment." (f) Mithkoneth and token, Ezek.  <span class="badLink">45:11</span> . (g) In New Testament metron, the usual Greek word thus rendered ( Matthew 7:2 ;  23:32 ;  Mark 4:24 ).  </li><li> Those which are definite. (a) 'Eyphah,  Deuteronomy 25:14 Deuteronomy 25:15 , usually "ephah." (b) Ammah,  Jeremiah 51:13 , usually "cubit." (c) Kor,  1 Kings 4:22 , elsewhere "cor;" Greek koros,  Luke 16:7 . (d) Seah,  Genesis 18:6 ;  1 Samuel 25:18 , a seah; Greek saton,  Matthew 13:33 ;  Luke 13:21 . (e) Shalish, "a great measure,"  Isaiah 40:12 ; literally a third, i.e., of an ephah. (f) In New Testament batos,  Luke 16:6 , the Hebrew "bath;" and choinix,  Revelation 6:6 , the choenix, equal in dry commodities to one-eighth of a modius.   </li>
Meat-offering	<p>(Heb. minhah), originally a gift of any kind. This Hebrew word came latterly to denote an "unbloody" sacrifice, as opposed to a "bloody" sacrifice. A "drink-offering" generally accompanied it. The law regarding it is given in  Leviticus 2 , and  6:14-23 . It was a recognition of the sovereignty of God and of his bounty in giving all earthly blessings ( 1 Chronicles 29:10-14 ;  Deuteronomy 26:5-11 ). It was an offering which took for granted and was based on the offering for sin. It followed the sacrifice of blood. It was presented every day with the burnt-offering ( Exodus 29:40 Exodus 29:41 ), and consisted of flour or of cakes prepared in a special way with oil and frankincense.  </p>
Mebunnai	<p>construction, building of Jehovah, one of David's bodyguard ( 2 Samuel 23:27 ; comp  21:18 ); called Sibbechai and Sibbecai ( 1 Chronicles 11:29 ;  27:11 ).  </p>
Medad	<p>love, one of the elders nominated to assist Moses in the government of the people. He and Eldad "prophesied in the camp" ( Numbers 11:24-29 ).  </p>
Medan	<p>contention, the third son of Abraham by Keturah ( Genesis 25:2 ).  </p>
Mede	<p>(Heb. Madai), a Median or inhabitant of Media ( Daniel 11:1 ). In  Genesis 10:2  the Hebrew word occurs in the list of the sons of Japheth. But probably this is an ethnic and not a personal name, and denotes simply the Medes as descended from Japheth.  </p>
Medeba	<p>waters of quiet, an ancient Moabite town ( Numbers 21:30 ). It was assigned to the tribe of Reuben ( Joshua 13:16 ). Here was fought the great battle in which Joab defeated the Ammonites and their allies ( 1 Chronicles 19:7-15 ; Compare  2 Samuel 10:6-14 ). In the time of ( Isaiah 15:2 ) the Moabites regained possession of it from the Ammonites. (See HANUN .) </p><p> The ruins of this important city, now Madeba or Madiyabah, are seen about 8 miles south-west of Heshbon, and 14 east of the Dead Sea. Among these are the ruins of what must have been a large temple, and of three cisterns of considerable extent, which are now dry. These cisterns may have originated the name Medeba, "waters of quiet." (See OMRI .) </p>
Media	<p>Heb. Madai, which is rendered in the Authorized Version (1) "Madai,"  Genesis 10:2 ; (2) "Medes,"  2 Kings 17:6 ;  18:11 ; (3) "Media,"  Esther 1:3 ;  10:2 ;  Isaiah 21:2 ;  Daniel 8:20 ; (4) "Mede," only in  Daniel 11:1 .  </p><p> We first hear of this people in the Assyrian cuneiform records, under the name of Amada, about B.C. 840. They appear to have been a branch of the Aryans, who came from the east bank of the Indus, and were probably the predominant race for a while in the Mesopotamian valley. They consisted for three or four centuries of a number of tribes, each ruled by its own chief, who at length were brought under the Assyrian yoke ( 2 Kings 17:6 ). From this subjection they achieved deliverance, and formed themselves into an empire under Cyaxares (B.C. 633). This monarch entered into an alliance with the king of Babylon, and invaded Assyria, capturing and destroying the city of Nineveh (B.C. 625), thus putting an end to the Assyrian monarchy ( Nahum 1:8 ;  Nahum 2:5 Nahum 2:6 ;  Nahum 3:13 Nahum 3:14 ).  </p><p> Media now rose to a place of great power, vastly extending its boundaries. But it did not long exist as an independent kingdom. It rose with Cyaxares, its first king, and it passed away with him; for during the reign of his son and successor Astyages, the Persians waged war against the Medes and conquered them, the two nations being united under one monarch, Cyrus the Persian (B.C. 558).  </p><p> The "cities of the Medes" are first mentioned in connection with the deportation of the Israelites on the destruction of Samaria ( 2 Kings 17:6 ;  18:11 ). Soon afterwards ( Isaiah 13:17 ;  21:2 ) speaks of the part taken by the Medes in the destruction of Babylon (Compare  Jeremiah 51:11 Jeremiah 51:28 ). Daniel gives an account of the reign of Darius the Mede, who was made viceroy by Cyrus ( Daniel 6:1-28 ). The decree of Cyrus, Ezra informs us ( 6:2-5 ), was found in "the palace that is in the province of the Medes," Achmetha or Ecbatana of the Greeks, which is the only Median city mentioned in Scripture.  </p>
Mediator	<p>one who intervenes between two persons who are at variance, with a view to reconcile them. This word is not found in the Old Testament; but the idea it expresses is found in  Job 9:33 , in the word "daysman" (q.v.), marg., "umpire."  </p><p> This word is used in the New Testament to denote simply an internuncius, an ambassador, one who acts as a medium of communication between two contracting parties. In this sense Moses is called a mediator in  Galatians 3:19 .  </p><p> Christ is the one and only mediator between God and man ( 1 Timothy 2:5 ;  Hebrews 8:6 ;  9:15 ;  12:24 ). He makes reconciliation between God and man by his all-perfect atoning sacrifice. Such a mediator must be at once divine and human, divine, that his obedience and his sufferings might possess infinite worth, and that he might possess infinite wisdom and knowlege and power to direct all things in the kingdoms of providence and grace which are committed to his hands ( Matthew 28:18 ;  John 5:22 John 5:25 John 5:26 John 5:27 ); and human, that in his work he might represent man, and be capable of rendering obedience to the law and satisfying the claims of justice ( Hebrews 2:17 Hebrews 2:18 ;  Hebrews 4:15 Hebrews 4:16 ), and that in his glorified humanity he might be the head of a glorified Church ( Romans 8:29 ).  </p><p> This office involves the three functions of prophet, priest, and king, all of which are discharged by Christ both in his estate of humiliation and exaltation. These functions are so inherent in the one office that the quality appertaining to each gives character to every mediatorial act. They are never separated in the exercise of the office of mediator. </p>
Meekness	<p>a calm temper of mind, not easily provoked ( James 3:13 ). Peculiar promises are made to the meek ( Matthew 5:5 ;  Isaiah 66:2 ). The cultivation of this spirit is enjoined ( Colossians 3:12 ;  1 Timothy 6:11 ;  Zephaniah 2:3 ), and is exemplified in Christ ( Matthew 11:29 ), Abraham ( Genesis 13 ;  Genesis 16:5 Genesis 16:6 ) Moses ( Numbers 12:3 ), David ( Zechariah 12:8 ;  2 Sam  Zechariah 16:10  Zechariah 16:12 ), and Paul ( 1 Corinthians 9:19 ).  </p>
Megiddo	<p>place of troops, originally one of the royal cities of the Canaanites ( Joshua 12:21 ), belonged to the tribe of Manasseh ( Judges 1:27 ), but does not seem to have been fully occupied by the Israelites till the time of Solomon ( 1 Kings 4:12 ;  9:15 ).  </p><p> The valley or plain of Megiddo was part of the plain of Esdraelon, the great battle-field of Palestine. It was here Barak gained a notable victory over Jabin, the king of Hazor, whose general, Sisera, led on the hostile army. Barak rallied the warriors of the northern tribes, and under the encouragement of Deborah (q.v.), the prophetess, attacked the Canaanites in the great plain. The army of Sisera was thrown into complete confusion, and was engulfed in the waters of the Kishon, which had risen and overflowed its banks ( Judges 4:5 ).  </p><p> Many years after this (B.C. 610), Pharaohnecho II., on his march against the king of Assyria, passed through the plains of Philistia and Sharon; and King Josiah, attempting to bar his progress in the plain of Megiddo, was defeated by the Egyptians. He was wounded in battle, and died as they bore him away in his chariot towards Jerusalem ( 2 Kings 23:29 ;  2 Chr  35:22-24 ), and all Israel mourned for him. So general and bitter was this mourning that it became a proverb, to which ( Zechariah 12:11 Zechariah 12:12 ) alludes. Megiddo has been identified with the modern el-Lejjun, at the head of the Kishon, under the north-eastern brow of Carmel, on the south-western edge of the plain of Esdraelon, and 9 miles west of Jezreel. Others identify it with Mujedd'a, 4 miles south-west of Bethshean, but the question of its site is still undetermined.  </p>
Mehetabeel	<p>whose benefactor is God, the father of Delaiah, and grandfather of Shemaiah, who joined Sanballat against Nehemiah ( Nehemiah 6:10 ).  </p>
Mehetabel	<p>wife of Hadad, one of the kings of Edom ( Genesis 36:39 ).  </p>
Mehujael	<p>smitten by God, the son of Irad, and father of Methusael ( Genesis 4:18 ).  </p>
Mehuman	<p>faithful, one of the eunchs whom Ahasuerus (Xerxes) commanded to bring in Vashti ( Esther 1:10 ).  </p>
Mehunims	<p>habitations, ( 2 Chronicles 26:7 ; RSV "Meunim," Vulg. Ammonitae), a people against whom Uzziah waged a successful war. This word is in Hebrew the plural of Ma'on, and thus denotes the Maonites who inhabited the country on the eastern side of the Wady el-Arabah. They are again mentioned in  1 Chronicles 4:41  (RSV), in the reign of King Hezekiah, as a Hamite people, settled in the eastern end of the valley of Gedor, in the wilderness south of Palestine. In this passage the Authorized Version has "habitation," erroneously following the translation of Luther.  </p><p> They are mentioned in the list of those from whom the Nethinim were made up ( Ezra 2:50 ;  Nehemiah 7:52 ).  </p>
Me-jarkon	<p>waters of yellowness, or clear waters, a river in the tribe of Dan ( Joshua 19:46 ). It has been identified with the river 'Aujeh, which rises at Antipatris.  </p>
Mekonah	<p>a base or foundation, a town in the south of Judah ( Nehemiah 11:28 ), near Ziklag.  </p>
Melchi	<p>my king. </p><li> The son of Addi, and father of Neri ( Luke 3:28 ). </li><li> Luke 3:24 .   </li>
Melchizedek	<p>king of righteousness, the king of Salem (q.v.). All we know of him is recorded in  Genesis 14:18-20 . He is subsequently mentioned only once in the Old Testament, in  Psalms 110:4 . The typical significance of his history is set forth in detail in the Epistle to the Hebrews, ch. 7. The apostle there points out the superiority of his priesthood to that of Aaron in these several respects, (1) Even Abraham paid him tithes; (2) he blessed Abraham; (3) he is the type of a Priest who lives for ever; (4) Levi, yet unborn, paid him tithes in the person of Abraham; (5) the permanence of his priesthood in Christ implied the abrogation of the Levitical system; (6) he was made priest not without an oath; and (7) his priesthood can neither be transmitted nor interrupted by death: "this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood."  </p><p> The question as to who this mysterious personage was has given rise to a great deal of modern speculation. It is an old tradition among the Jews that he was Shem, the son of Noah, who may have survived to this time. Melchizedek was a Canaanitish prince, a worshipper of the true God, and in his peculiar history and character an instructive type of our Lord, the great High Priest ( Hebrews 5:6 Hebrews 5:7 ;  6:20 ). One of the Amarna tablets is from Ebed-Tob, king of Jerusalem, the successor of Melchizedek, in which he claims the very attributes and dignity given to Melchizedek in the Epistle to the Hebrews.  </p>
Melea	<p>fulness, the son of Menan and father of Eliakim, in the genealogy of our Lord ( Luke 3:31 ).  </p>
Melech	<p>king, the second of Micah's four sons ( 1 Chronicles 8:35 ), and thus grandson of Mephibosheth.  </p>
Melita	<p>( Acts 27:28 ), an island in the Mediterranean, the modern Malta. Here the ship in which Paul was being conveyed a prisoner to Rome was wrecked. The bay in which it was wrecked now bears the name of "St. Paul's Bay", "a certain creek with a shore." It is about 2 miles deep and 1 broad, and the whole physical condition of the scene answers the description of the shipwreck given in  Acts 28 . It was originally colonized by Phoenicians ("barbarians,"  28:2 ). It came into the possession of the Greeks (B.C. 736), from whom it was taken by the Carthaginians (B.C. 528). In B.C. 242 it was conquered by the Romans, and was governed by a Roman propraetor at the time of the shipwreck ( Acts 28:7 ). Since 1800, when the French garrison surrendered to the English force, it has been a British dependency. The island is about 17 miles long and 9 wide, and about 60 in circumference. After a stay of three months on this island, during which the "barbarians" showed them no little kindness, Julius procured for himself and his company a passage in another Alexandrian corn-ship which had wintered in the island, in which they proceeded on their voyage to Rome ( Acts 28:13 Acts 28:14 ).  </p>
Melons	<p>only in  Numbers 11:5 , the translation of the Hebrew abattihim, the LXX. and Vulgate pepones, Arabic britikh. Of this plant there are various kinds, the Egyptian melon, the Cucumus chate, which has been called "the queen of cucumbers;" the water melon, the Cucurbita citrullus; and the common or flesh melon, the Cucumus melo. "A traveller in the East who recollects the intense gratitude which a gift of a slice of melon inspired while journeying over the hot and dry plains, will readily comprehend the regret with which the Hebrews in the Arabian desert looked back upon the melons of Egypt" (Kitto).  </p>
Melzar	<p>probably a Persian word meaning master of wine, i.e., chief butler; the title of an officer at the Babylonian court ( Daniel 1:11 Daniel 1:16 ) who had charge of the diet of the Hebrew youths.  </p>
Memphis	<p>only in  Hosea 9:6 , Hebrew Moph. In  Isaiah 19:13 ;  Jeremiah 2:16 ;  Jeremiah 46:14 Jeremiah 46:19 ;  Ezekiel 30:13 Ezekiel 30:16 , it is mentioned under the name Noph. It was the capital of Lower, i.e., of Northern Egypt. From certain remains found half buried in the sand, the site of this ancient city has been discovered near the modern village of Minyet Rahinch, or Mitraheny, about 16 miles above the ancient head of the Delta, and 9 miles south of Cairo, on the west bank of the Nile. It is said to have been founded by Menes, the first king of Egypt, and to have been in circumference about 19 miles. "There are few remains above ground," says Manning (The Land of the Pharaohs), "of the splendour of ancient Memphis. The city has utterly disappeared. If any traces yet exist, they are buried beneath the vast mounds of crumbling bricks and broken pottery which meet the eye in every direction. Near the village of Mitraheny is a colossal statue of Rameses the Great. It is apparently one of the two described by Herodotus and Diodorus as standing in front of the temple of Ptah. They were originally 50 feet in height. The one which remains, though mutilated, measures 48 feet. It is finely carved in limestone, which takes a high polish, and is evidently a portrait. It lies in a pit, which, during the inundation, is filled with water. As we gaze on this fallen and battered statue of the mighty conqueror who was probably contemporaneous with Moses, it is impossible not to remember the words of the prophet Isaiah,  19:13 ;  44:16-19 , and Jeremiah,  46:19 ."  </p>
Memucan	<p>dignified, one of the royal counsellors at the court of Ahasuerus, by whose suggestion Vashti was divorced ( Esther 1:14 Esther 1:16 Esther 1:21 ).  </p>
Menahem	<p>conforting, the son of Gadi, and successor of Shallum, king of Israel, whom he slew. After a reign of about ten years (B.C. 771-760) he died, leaving the throne to his son Pekahiah. His reign was one of cruelty and oppression ( 2 Kings 15:14-22 ). During his reign, Pul (q.v.), king of Assyria, came with a powerful force against Israel, but was induced to retire by a gift from Menahem of 1,000 talents of silver.  </p>
Mene	<p>( Daniel 5:25 Daniel 5:26 ), numbered, one of the words of the mysterious inscription written "upon the plaister of the wall" in Belshazzar's palace at Babylon. The writing was explained by Daniel. (See BELSHAZZAR .) </p>
Meni	<p> Isaiah 65:11 , marg. (A.V., "that number;" RSV, "destiny"), probably an idol which the captive Israelites worshipped after the example of the Babylonians. It may have been a symbol of destiny. LXX., tuche.  </p>
Meonenim	<p>( Judges 9:37 ; A.V., "the plain of Meonenim;" RSV, "the oak of Meonenim") means properly "soothsayers" or "sorcerers," "wizards" ( Deuteronomy 18:10 Deuteronomy 18:14 ;  2 Kings  21:6 ;  Micah 5:12 ). This may be the oak at Shechem under which Abram pitched his tent (see SHECHEM), the "enchanter's oak," so called, perhaps, from Jacob's hiding the "strange gods" under it ( Genesis 35:4 ).  </p>
Mephaath	<p>splendour, a Levitical city ( Joshua 21:37 ) of the tribe of Reuben ( 13:18 ).  </p>
Mephibosheth	<p>exterminator of shame; i.e., of idols. </p><li> The name of Saul's son by the concubine Rizpah (q.v.), the daughter of Aiah. He and his brother Armoni were with five others "hanged on a hill before the Lord" by the Gibeonites, and their bodies exposed in the sun for five months ( 2 Samuel 21:8-10 ). </li><li> The son of Jonathan, and grandson of Saul ( 2 Samuel 4:4 ). He was but five years old when his father and grandfather fell on Mount Gilboa. The child's nurse hearing of this calamity, fled with him from Gibeah, the royal residence, and stumbling in her haste, the child was thrown to the ground and maimed in both his feet, and ever after was unable to walk ( 19:26 ). He was carried to the land of Gilead, where he found a refuge in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, at Lo-debar, by whom he was brought up.  <p> Some years after this, when David had subdued all the adversaries of Israel, he began to think of the family of Jonathan, and discovered that Mephibosheth was residing in the house of Machir. Thither he sent royal messengers, and brought him and his infant son to Jerusalem, where he ever afterwards resided ( 2 Samuel 9 ).  </p><p> When David was a fugitive, according to the story of Ziba ( 2 Samuel 16:1-4 ) Mephibosheth proved unfaithful to him, and was consequently deprived of half of his estates; but according to his own story, however ( 19:24-30 ), he had remained loyal to his friend. After this incident he is only mentioned as having been protected by David against the vengeance the Gibeonites were permitted to execute on the house of Saul ( 21:7 ). He is also called Merib-baal ( 1 Chronicles 8:34 ;  9:40 ). (See ZIBA .) </p> </li>
Merab	<p>increase, the eldest of Saul's two daughters ( 1 Samuel 14:49 ). She was betrothed to David after his victory over Goliath, but does not seem to have entered heartily into this arrangement ( 1 Samuel 18:2 1 Samuel 18:17 1 Samuel 18:19 ). She was at length, however, married to Adriel of Abel-Meholah, a town in the Jordan valley, about 10 miles south of Bethshean, with whom the house of Saul maintained alliance. She had five sons, who were all put to death by the Gibeonites on the hill of Gibeah ( 2 Samuel 21:8 ).  </p>
Meraiah	<p>resistance, a chief priest, a contemporary of the high priest Joiakim ( Nehemiah 12:12 ).  </p>
Meraioth	<p>rebellions. </p><li> Father of Amariah, a high priest of the line of Eleazar ( 1 Chronicles 6:6 1 Chronicles 6:7 1 Chronicles 6:52 ).  </li><li> Nehemiah 12:15 , a priest who went to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel. He is called Meremoth in  Nehemiah 12:3 .   </li>
Merari	<p>sad; bitter, the youngest son of Levi, born before the descent of Jacob into Egypt, and one of the seventy who accompanied him thither ( Genesis 46:11 ;  Exodus 6:16 ). He became the head of one of the great divisions of the Levites ( Exodus 6:19 ). (See MERARITES .) </p>
Naam	<p>pleasantness, one of the three sons of Caleb, the son of Jephunneh ( 1 Chronicles 4:15 ).  </p>
Naamah	<p>the beautiful. </p><li> The daughter of Lamech and Zillah ( Genesis 4: :  22 ).  </li><li> The daughter of the king of Ammon, one of the wives of Solomon, the only one who appears to have borne him a son, viz., Rehoboam ( 1 Kings 14:21 1 Kings 14:31 ).  </li><li> A city in the plain of Judah ( Joshua 15:41 ), supposed by some to be identified with Na'aneh, some 5 miles south-east of Makkedah.   </li>
Naaman	<p>pleasantness, a Syrian, the commander of the armies of Benhadad II. in the time of Joram, king of Israel. He was afflicted with leprosy; and when the little Hebrew slave-girl that waited on his wife told her of a prophet in Samaria who could cure her master, he obtained a letter from Benhadad and proceeded with it to Joram. The king of Israel suspected in this some evil design against him, and rent his clothes. Elisha the prophet hearing of this, sent for Naaman, and the strange interview which took place is recorded in  2 Kings 5 . The narrative contains all that is known of the Syrian commander. He was cured of his leprosy by dipping himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of Elisha. His cure is alluded to by our Lord ( Luke 4:27 ).  </p>
Naamathite	<p>the designation of Zophar, one of Job's three friends ( Job 2:11 ;  11:1 ), so called from some place in Arabia, called Naamah probably.  </p>
Naarah	<p>a girl, the second of Ashur's two wives, of the tribe of Judah ( 1 Chronicles 4:5 1 Chronicles 4:6 ).  </p>
Naarai	<p>youthful, a military chief in David's army ( 1 Chronicles 11:37 ), called also Paarai ( 2 Samuel 23:35 ).  </p>
Naaran	<p>boyish, juvenile, a town in Ephraim between Bethel and Jericho ( 1 Chronicles 7:28 ).  </p>
Naarath	<p>girl, a town on the boundary between Ephraim and Benjamin ( Joshua 16:7 ), not far probably from Jericho, to the north ( 1 Chronicles 7:28 ).  </p>
Nabal	<p>foolish, a descendant of Caleb who dwelt at Maon ( 1 Samuel 25 ), the modern Main, 7 miles south-east of Hebron. He was "very great, and he had 3,000 sheep and 1,000 goats...but the man was churlish and evil in his doings." During his wanderings David came into that district, and hearing that Nabal was about to shear his sheep, he sent ten of his young men to ask "whatsoever cometh unto thy hand for thy servants." Nabal insultingly resented the demand, saying, "Who is David, and who is the son of Jesse?" ( 1 Samuel 25:10 1 Samuel 25:11 ). One of the shepherds that stood by and saw the reception David's messengers had met with, informed Abigail, Nabal's wife, who at once realized the danger that threatened her household. She forthwith proceeded to the camp of David, bringing with her ample stores of provisions ( 25:18 ). She so courteously and persuasively pled her cause that David's anger was appeased, and he said to her, "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel which sent thee this day to meet me."  </p><p> On her return she found her husband incapable from drunkenness of understanding the state of matters, and not till the following day did she explain to him what had happened. He was stunned by a sense of the danger to which his conduct had exposed him. "His heart died within him, and he became as a stone." and about ten days after "the Lord smote Nabal that he died" ( 1 Samuel 25:37 1 Samuel 25:38 ). Not long after David married Abigail (q.v.).  </p>
Naboth	<p>fruits, "the Jezreelite," was the owner of a portion of ground on the eastern slope of the hill of Jezreel ( 2 Kings 9:25 2 Kings 9:26 ). This small "plat of ground" seems to have been all he possessed. It was a vineyard, and lay "hard by the palace of Ahab" ( 1 Kings 21:1 1 Kings 21:2 ), who greatly coveted it. Naboth, however, refused on any terms to part with it to the king. He had inherited it from his fathers, and no Israelite could lawfully sell his property ( Leviticus 25:23 ). Jezebel, Ahab's wife, was grievously offended at Naboth's refusal to part with his vineyard. By a crafty and cruel plot she compassed his death. His sons also shared his fate ( 2 Kings 9:26 ;  1 Kings 21:19 ). She then came to Ahab and said, "Arise, take possession of the vineyard; for Naboth is not alive, but dead." Ahab arose and went forth into the garden which had so treacherously and cruelly been acquired, seemingly enjoying his new possession, when, lo, Elijah suddenly appeared before him and pronounced against him a fearful doom ( 1 Kings 21:17-24 ). Jehu and Bidcar were with Ahab at this time, and so deeply were the words of Elijah imprinted on Jehu's memory that many years afterwards he refers to them ( 2 Kings 9:26 ), and he was the chief instrument in inflicting this sentence on Ahab and Jezebel and all their house ( 9:30-37 ). The house of Ahab was extinguished by him. Not one of all his great men and his kinsfolk and his priests did Jehu spare ( 10:11 ).  </p><p> Ahab humbled himself at Elijah's words ( 1 Kings 21:28 1 Kings 21:29 ), and therefore the prophecy was fulfilled not in his fate but in that of his son Joram ( 2 Kings 9:25 ).  </p><p> The history of Naboth, compared with that of Ahab and Jezebel, furnishes a remarkable illustration of the law of a retributive providence, a law which runs through all history (Compare  Psalms 109:17 Psalms 109:18 ).  </p>
Nachon	<p>prepared, the owner of a thrashing-floor near which Uzzah was slain ( 2 Samuel 6:6 ); called also Chidon ( 1 Chronicles 13:9 ).  </p>
Nadab	<p>liberal, generous. </p><li> The eldest of Aaron's four sons ( Exodus 6:23 ;  Numbers 3:2 ). He with his brothers and their father were consecrated as priests of Jehovah ( Exodus 28:1 ). He afterwards perished with Abihu for the sin of offering strange fire on the altar of burnt-offering ( Leviticus 10:1 Leviticus 10:2 ;  Numbers 3:4 ;  26:60 ).  </li><li> The son and successor of Jeroboam, the king of Israel ( 1 Kings 14:20 ). While engaged with all Israel in laying siege to Gibbethon, a town of southern Dan ( Joshua 19:44 ), a conspiracy broke out in his army, and he was slain by Baasha ( 1 Kings 15:25-28 ), after a reign of two years (B.C. 955-953). The assassination of Nadab was followed by that of his whole house, and thus this great Ephraimite family became extinct ( 1 Kings 15:29 ).  </li><li> One of the sons of Shammai in the tribe of Judah ( 1 Chronicles 2:28 1 Chronicles 2:30 ).   </li>
Nagge	<p>illuminating, one of the ancestors of Christ in the maternal line ( Luke 3:25 ).  </p>
Nahaliel	<p>possession, or valley of God, one of the encampments of the Israelites in the wilderness ( Numbers 21:19 ), on the confines of Moab. This is identified with the ravine of the Zerka M'ain, the ancient Callirhoe, the hot springs on the east of the Jordan, not far from the Dead Sea.  </p>
Nahallal	<p>pasture, a city in Zebulun on the border of Issachar ( Joshua 19:15 ), the same as Nahalol ( Judges 1:30 ). It was given to the Levites. It has been by some identified with Malul in the plain of Esdraelon, 4 miles from Nazareth.  </p>
Naharai	<p>snorer, a Berothite, one of David's heroes, and armour-bearer of Joab ( 1 Chronicles 11:39 ).  </p>
Nahash	<p>serpent. </p><li> King of the Ammonites in the time of Saul. The inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead having been exposed to great danger from Nahash, sent messengers to Gibeah to inform Saul of their extremity. He promptly responded to the call, and gathering together an army he marched against Nahash. "And it came to pass that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them [the Ammonites] were not left together" ( 1 Samuel 11:1-11 ).  </li><li> Another king of the Ammonites of the same name is mentioned, who showed kindness to David during his wanderings ( 2 Samuel 10:2 ). On his death David sent an embassy of sympathy to Hanun, his son and successor, at Rabbah Ammon, his capital. The grievous insult which was put upon these ambassadors led to a war against the Ammonites, who, with their allies the Syrians, were completely routed in a battle fought at "the entering in of the gate," probably of Medeba ( 2 Samuel 10:6-14 ). Again Hadarezer rallied the Syrian host, which was totally destroyed by the Israelite army under Joab in a decisive battle fought at Helam ( 2 Samuel 10:17 ), near to Hamath ( 1 Chronicles 18:3 ). "So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more" ( 2 Samuel 10:19 ).  </li><li> The father of Amasa, who was commander-in-chief of Abasolom's army ( 2 Samuel 17:25 ). Jesse's wife had apparently been first married to this man, to whom she bore Abigail and Zeruiah, who were thus David's sisters, but only on the mother's side ( 1 Chronicles 2:16 ).   </li>
Nahath	<p>rest. </p><li> One of the four sons of Reuel, the son of Esau ( Genesis 36:13 Genesis 36:17 ). </li><li> A Kohathite Levite ( 1 Chronicles 6:26 ). </li><li> A Levite, one of the overseers of the sacred offerings of the temple ( 2 Chronicles 31:13 ).   </li>
Nahbi	<p>hidden, one of the twelve spies sent out to explore the land of Canaan ( Numbers 13:14 ).  </p>
Nahor	<p>snorting. </p><li> The father of Terah, who was the father of Abraham ( Genesis 11:22-25 ;  Luke 3:34 ).  </li><li> A son of Terah, and elder brother of Abraham ( Genesis 11:26 Genesis 11:27 ;  Joshua 24:2 , RSV). He married Milcah, the daughter of his brother Haran, and remained in the land of his nativity on the east of the river Euphrates at Haran ( Genesis 11:27-32 ). A correspondence was maintained between the family of Abraham in Canaan and the relatives in the old ancestral home at Haran till the time of Jacob. When Jacob fled from Haran all intercourse between the two branches of the family came to an end ( Genesis 31:55 ). His grand-daughter Rebekah became Isaac's wife ( 24:67 ).   </li>
Nahshon	<p>sorcerer, the son of Aminadab, and prince of the children of Judah at the time of the first numbering of the tribes in the wilderness ( Exodus 6:23 ). His sister Elisheba was the wife of Aaron. He died in the wilderness ( Numbers 26:64 Numbers 26:65 ). His name occurs in the Greek form Naasson in the genealogy of Christ (Matt,  1:4 ;  Luke 3:32 ).  </p>
Nahum	<p>consolation, the seventh of the so-called minor prophets, an Elkoshite. All we know of him is recorded in the book of his prophecies. He was probably a native of Galilee, and after the deportation of the ten tribes took up his residence in Jerusalem. Others think that Elkosh was the name of a place on the east bank of the Tigris, and that Nahum dwelt there. </p>
Nahum, Book of	<p>Nahum prophesied, according to some, in the beginning of the reign of Ahaz (B.C. 743). Others, however, think that his prophecies are to be referred to the latter half of the reign of Hezekiah (about B.C. 709). This is the more probable opinion, internal evidences leading to that conclusion. Probably the book was written in Jerusalem (soon after B.C. 709), where he witnessed the invasion of Sennacherib and the destruction of his host ( 2 Kings 19:35 ).  </p><p> The subject of this prophecy is the approaching complete and final destruction of Nineveh, the capital of the great and at that time flourishing Assyrian empire. Assur-bani-pal was at the height of his glory. Nineveh was a city of vast extent, and was then the centre of the civilzation and commerce of the world, a "bloody city all full of lies and robbery" ( Nahum 3:1 ), for it had robbed and plundered all the neighbouring nations. It was strongly fortified on every side, bidding defiance to every enemy; yet it was to be utterly destroyed as a punishment for the great wickedness of its inhabitants.  </p><p> Jonah had already uttered his message of warning, and Nahum was followed by Zephaniah, who also predicted ( Zephaniah 2:4-15 ) the destruction of the city, predictions which were remarkably fulfilled (B.C. 625) when Nineveh was destroyed apparently by fire, and the Assyrian empire came to an end, an event which changed the face of Asia. (See NINEVEH .) </p>
Nail	<p>for fastening. </p><li> Hebrew yathed, "piercing," a peg or nail of any material ( Ezekiel 15:3 ), more especially a tent-peg ( Exodus 27:19 ;  35:18 ;  38:20 ), with one of which Jael (q.v.) pierced the temples of Sisera ( Judges 4:21 Judges 4:22 ). This word is also used metaphorically ( Zechariah 10:4 ) for a prince or counsellor, just as "the battle-bow" represents a warrior.  </li><li> Masmer, a "point," the usual word for a nail. The words of the wise are compared to "nails fastened by the masters of assemblies" (Eccl  12:11 , A.V.). The Revised Version reads, "as nails well fastened are the words of the masters," etc. Others (as Plumptre) read, "as nails fastened are the masters of assemblies" (Compare  Isaiah 22:23 ;  Ezra 9:8 ). David prepared nails for the temple ( 1 Chronicles 22:3 ;  2 Chr  3:9 ). The nails by which our Lord was fixed to the cross are mentioned ( John 20:25 ;  Colossians 2:14 ).  <p> Nail of the finger (Heb. tsipporen, "scraping"). To "pare the nails" is in  Deuteronomy 21:12  (marg., "make," or "dress," or "suffer to grow") one of the signs of purification, separation from former heathenism (Compare  Leviticus 14:8 ;  Numbers 8:7 ). In  Jeremiah 17:1  this word is rendered "point."  </p> </li>
Nain	<p>(from Heb. nain, "green pastures," "lovely"), the name of a town near the gate of which Jesus raised to life a widow's son ( Luke 7:11-17 ). It is identified with the village called Nein, standing on the north-western slope of Jebel ed-Duhy (=the "hill Moreh" = "Little hermon"), about 4 miles from Tabor and 25 southwest of Capernaum. At the foot of the slope on which it stands is the great plain of Esdraelon.  </p><p> This was the first miracle of raising the dead our Lord had wrought, and it excited great awe and astonishment among the people. </p>
Naioth	<p>dwellings, the name given to the prophetical college established by Samuel near Ramah. It consisted of a cluster of separate dwellings, and hence its name. David took refuge here when he fled from Saul ( 1 Samuel 19:18 1 Samuel 19:19 1 Samuel 19:22 1 Samuel 19:23 ), and here he passed a few weeks in peace (Compare  Psalms 11 ). It was probably the common residence of the "sons of the prophets."  </p>
Naked	<p>This word denotes (1) absolute nakedness ( Genesis 2:25 ;  Job 1:21 ; Eccl  5:15 ;  Micah 1:8 ;  Amos 2:16 ); (2) being poorly clad ( Isaiah 58:7 ;  James 2:15 ). It denotes also (3) the state of one who has laid aside his loose outer garment (Lat. nudus), and appears clothed only in a long tunic or under robe worn next the skin ( 1 Samuel 19:24 ;  Isaiah 47:3 ; Compare  Mark 14:52 ;  John 21:7 ). It is used figuratively, meaning "being discovered" or "made manifest" ( Job 26:6 ;  Hebrews 4:13 ). In  Exodus 32:25  the expression "the people were naked" (A.V.) is more correctly rendered in the Revised Version "the people were broken loose", i.e., had fallen into a state of lawlessness and insubordination. In  2 Chronicles 28:19  the words "he made Judah naked" (A.V.), but Revised Version "he had dealt wantonly in Judah," mean "he had permitted Judah to break loose from all the restraints of religion."  </p>
Naomi	<p>the lovable; my delight, the wife of Elimelech, and mother of Mahlon and Chilion, and mother-in-law of ( Ruth 1:2 Ruth 1:20 Ruth 1:21 ;  2:1 ). Elimelech and his wife left the district of Bethlehem-Judah, and found a new home in the uplands of Moab. In course of time he died, as also his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, who had married women of Moab, and three widows were left mourning the loss of their husbands. Naomi longs to return now to her own land, to Bethlehem. One of her widowed daughters-in-law, Ruth, accompanies her, and is at length married to Boaz (q.v.).  </p>
Naphish	<p>refresher, one of the sons of Ishmael ( Genesis 25:15 ;  1 Chronicles 1:31 ). He was the father of an Arab tribe.  </p>
Naphtali	<p>my wrestling, the fifth son of Jacob. His mother was Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid ( Genesis 30:8 ). When Jacob went down into Egypt, Naphtali had four sons ( Genesis 46:24 ). Little is known of him as an individual.  </p>
Naphtali, Mount	<p>the mountainous district of Naphtali ( Joshua 20:7 ).  </p>
Naphtali, Tribe of	<p>On this tribe Jacob pronounced the patriarchal blessing, "Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words" ( Genesis 49:21 ). It was intended thus to set forth under poetic imagery the future character and history of the tribe.  </p><p> At the time of the Exodus this tribe numbered 53,400 adult males ( Numbers 1:43 ), but at the close of the wanderings they numbered only 45,400 ( 26:48-50 ). Along with Dan and Asher they formed "the camp of Dan," under a common standard ( 2:25-31 ), occupying a place during the march on the north side of the tabernacle.  </p><p> The possession assigned to this tribe is set forth in  Joshua 19:32-39 . It lay in the north-eastern corner of the land, bounded on the east by the Jordan and the lakes of Merom and Galilee, and on the north it extended far into Coele-Syria, the valley between the two Lebanon ranges. It comprehended a greater variety of rich and beautiful scenery and of soil and climate than fell to the lot of any other tribe. The territory of Naphtali extended to about 800 square miles, being the double of that of Issachar. The region around Kedesh, one of its towns, was originally called Galil, a name afterwards given to the whole northern division of Canaan. A large number of foreigners settled here among the mountains, and hence it was called "Galilee of the Gentiles" (q.v.),  Matthew 4:15 Matthew 4:16 . The southern portion of Naphtali has been called the "Garden of Palestine." It was of unrivalled fertility. It was the principal scene of our Lord's public ministry. Here most of his parables were spoken and his miracles wrought.  </p><p> This tribe was the first to suffer from the invasion of Benhadad, king of Syria, in the reigns of Baasha, king of Israel, and Asa, king of Judah ( 1 Kings 15:20 ;  2 Chr  16:4 ). In the reign of Pekah, king of Israel, the Assyrians under Tiglath-pileser swept over the whole north of Israel, and carried the people into captivity ( 2 Kings 15:29 ). Thus the kingdom of Israel came to an end (B.C. 722).  </p><p> Naphtali is now almost wholly a desert, the towns of Tiberias, on the shore of the Lake of Galilee, and Safed being the only places in it of any importance. </p>
Naphtuhim	<p>a Hamitic tribe descended from Mizraim ( Genesis 10:13 ). Others identify this word with Napata, the name of the city and territory on the southern frontier of Mizraim, the modern Meroe, at the great bend of the Nile at Soudan. This city was the royal residence, it is said, of Queen Candace ( Acts 8:27 ). Here there are extensive and splendid ruins.  </p>
Napkin	<p>(Gr. soudarion,  John 11:44 ;  20:7 ; Lat. sudarium, a "sweat-cloth"), a cloth for wiping the sweat from the face. But the word is used of a wrapper to fold money in ( Luke 19:20 ), and as an article of dress, a "handkerchief" worn on the head ( Acts 19:12 ).  </p>
Narcissus	<p>daffodil, a Roman whom Paul salutes ( Romans 16:11 ). He is supposed to have been the private secretary of the emperor Claudius. This is, however, quite uncertain.  </p>
Nathan	<p>given. </p><li> A prophet in the reigns of David and Solomon ( 2 Chronicles 9:29 ). He is first spoken of in connection with the arrangements David made for the building of the temple ( 2 Samuel 7:2 2 Samuel 7:3 2 Samuel 7:17 ), and next appears as the reprover of David on account of his sin with Bathsheba ( 12:1-14 ). He was charged with the education of ( Solomon 12:25 ), at whose inauguration to the throne he took a prominent part ( 1 Kings 1:8 1 Kings 1:10 1 Kings 1:11 1 Kings 1:22-45 ). His two sons, Zabad ( 1 Chronicles 2:36 ) and Azariah ( 1 Kings 4:5 ) occupied places of honour at the king's court. He last appears in assisting David in reorganizing the public worship ( 2 Chronicles 29:25 ). He seems to have written a life of David, and also a life of Solomon ( 1 Chronicles 29:29 ;  2 Chr  9:29 ).  </li><li> A son of David, by Bathsheba ( 2 Samuel 5:14 ), whose name appears in the genealogy of Mary, the mother of our Lord ( Luke 3:31 ).  </li><li> Ezra 8:16 .   </li>
Nathanael	<p>given or gift of God, one of our Lord's disciples, "of Cana in Galilee" ( John 21:2 ). He was "an Israelite indeed, in whom was no guile" ( John 1:47 John 1:48 ). His name occurs only in the Gospel of John, who in his list of the disciples never mentions Bartholomew, with whom he has consequently been identified. He was one of those to whom the Lord showed himself alive after his resurrection, at the Sea of Tiberias.  </p>
Nativity of Christ	<p>The birth of our Lord took place at the time and place predicted by the prophets ( Genesis 49:10 ;  Isaiah 7:14 ;  Jeremiah 31:15 ;  Micah 5:2 ;  Haggai 2:6-9 ;  Daniel 9:24 Daniel 9:25 ). Joseph and Mary were providentially led to go up to Bethlehem at this period, and there Christ was born ( Matthew 2:1 Matthew 2:6 ;  Luke 2:1 Luke 2:7 ). The exact year or month or day of his birth cannot, however, now be exactly ascertained. We know, however, that it took place in the "fulness of the time" ( Galatians 4:4 ), i.e., at the fittest time in the world's history. Chronologists are now generally agreed that the year 4 before the Christian era was the year of Christ's nativity, and consequently that he was about four years old in the year 1 A.D.  </p>
Naughty figs	<p>( Jeremiah 24:2 ). "The bad figs may have been such either from having decayed, and thus been reduced to a rotten condition, or as being the fruit of the sycamore, which contains a bitter juice" (Tristram, Nat. Hist.). The inferiority of the fruit is here referred to as an emblem of the rejected Zedekiah and his people.  </p>
Nazarene	<p>This epithet (Gr. Nazaraios) is applied to Christ only once ( Matthew 2:23 ). In all other cases the word is rendered "of Nazareth" ( Mark 1:24 ;  10:47 ;  14:67 , etc.). When this Greek designation was at first applied to our Lord, it was meant simply to denote the place of his residence. In course of time the word became a term of reproach. Thus the word "Nazarene" carries with it an allusion to those prophecies which speak of Christ as "despised of men" ( Isaiah 53:3 ). Some, however, think that in this name there is an allusion to the Hebrew <i> netser</i> , which signifies a branch or sprout. It is so applied to the Messiah ( Isaiah 11:1 ), i.e., he whom the prophets called the <i> Netse</i> , the "Branch." </p><p> The followers of Christ were called "the sect of Nazarenes" ( Acts 24:5 ). All over Palestine and Syria this name is still given to Christians. (See NAZARETH .) </p>
Nazareth	<p>separated, generally supposed to be the Greek form of the Hebrew <i> netser</i> , a "shoot" or "sprout." Some, however, think that the name of the city must be connected with the name of the hill behind it, from which one of the finest prospects in Palestine is obtained, and accordingly they derive it from the Hebrew <i> notserah</i> , i.e., one guarding or watching, thus designating the hill which overlooks and thus guards an extensive region. </p><p> This city is not mentioned in the Old Testament. It was the home of Joseph and Mary ( Luke 2:39 ), and here the angel announced to the Virgin the birth of the Messiah ( 1:26-28 ). Here Jesus grew up from his infancy to manhood ( 4:16 ); and here he began his public ministry in the synagogue ( Matthew 13:54 ), at which the people were so offended that they sought to cast him down from the precipice whereon their city was built ( Luke 4:29 ). Twice they expelled him from their borders ( 4:16-29 ;  Matthew 13:54-58 ); and he finally retired from the city, where he did not many mighty works because of their unbelief ( Matthew 13:58 ), and took up his residence in Capernaum.  </p><p> Nazareth is situated among the southern ridges of Lebanon, on the steep slope of a hill, about 14 miles from the Sea of Galilee and about 6 west from Mount Tabor. It is identified with the modern village en-Nazirah, of six or ten thousand inhabitants. It lies "as in a hollow cup" lower down upon the hill than the ancient city. The main road for traffic between Egypt and the interior of Asia passed by Nazareth near the foot of Tabor, and thence northward to Damascus.  </p><p> It is supposed from the words of Nathanael in  John 1:46  that the city of Nazareth was held in great disrepute, either because, it is said, the people of Galilee were a rude and less cultivated class, and were largely influenced by the Gentiles who mingled with them, or because of their lower type of moral and religious character. But there seems to be no sufficient reason for these suppositions. The Jews believed that, according to  Micah 5:2 , the birth of the Messiah would take place at Bethlehem, and nowhere else. Nathanael held the same opinion as his countrymen, and believed that the great "good" which they were all expecting could not come from Nazareth. This is probably what Nathanael meant. Moreover, there does not seem to be any evidence that the inhabitants of Galilee were in any respect inferior, or that a Galilean was held in contempt, in the time of our Lord. (See Dr. Merrill's Galilee in the Time of Christ.)  </p><p> The population of this city (now about 10,000) in the time of Christ probably amounted to 15,000 or 20,000 souls.  </p><p> "The so-called 'Holy House' is a cave under the Latin church, which appears to have been originally a tank. The 'brow of the hill', site of the attempted precipitation, is probably the northern cliff: the traditional site has been shown since the middle ages at some distance to the south. None of the traditional sites are traceable very early, and they have no authority. The name Nazareth perhaps means 'a watch tower' (now en-Nasrah), but is connected in the New Testament with Netzer, 'a branch' ( Isaiah 4:2 ;  Jeremiah 23:5 ;  Zechariah 3:8 ;  6:12 ;  Matthew 2:23 ), Nazarene being quite a different word from Nazarite."  </p>
Nazarite	<p>(Heb. form Nazirite), the name of such Israelites as took on them the vow prescribed in  Numbers 6:2-21 . The word denotes generally one who is separated from others and consecrated to God. Although there is no mention of any Nazarite before Samson, yet it is evident that they existed before the time of Moses. The vow of a Nazarite involved these three things, (1) abstinence from wine and strong drink, (2) refraining from cutting the hair off the head during the whole period of the continuance of the vow, and (3) the avoidance of contact with the dead.  </p><p> When the period of the continuance of the vow came to an end, the Nazarite had to present himself at the door of the sanctuary with (1) a he lamb of the first year for a burnt-offering, (2) a ewe lamb of the first year for a sin-offering, and (3) a ram for a peace-offering. After these sacrifices were offered by the priest, the Nazarite cut off his hair at the door and threw it into the fire under the peace-offering.  </p><p> For some reason, probably in the midst of his work at Corinth, Paul took on himself the Nazarite vow. This could only be terminated by his going up to Jerusalem to offer up the hair which till then was to be left uncut. But it seems to have been allowable for persons at a distance to cut the hair, which was to be brought up to Jerusalem, where the ceremony was completed. This Paul did at Cenchrea just before setting out on his voyage into Syria ( Acts 18:18 ).  </p><p> On another occasion ( Acts 21:23-26 ), at the feast of Pentecost, Paul took on himself again the Nazarite vow. "The ceremonies involved took a longer time than Paul had at his disposal, but the law permitted a man to share the vow if he could find companions who had gone through the prescribed ceremonies, and who permitted him to join their company. This permission was commonly granted if the new comer paid all the fees required from the whole company (fee to the Levite for cutting the hair and fees for sacrifices), and finished the vow along with the others. Four Jewish Christians were performing the vow, and would admit Paul to their company, provided he paid their expenses. Paul consented, paid the charges, and when the last seven days of the vow began he went with them to live in the temple, giving the usual notice to the priests that he had joined in regular fashion, was a sharer with the four men, and that his vow would end with theirs. Nazarites retired to the temple during the last period of seven days, because they could be secure there against any accidental defilement" (Lindsay's Acts).  </p><p> As to the duration of a Nazarite's vow, every one was left at liberty to fix his own time. There is mention made in Scripture of only three who were Nazarites for life, Samson, Samuel, and John the Baptist ( Judges 13:4 Judges 13:5 ;  1 Samuel 1:11 ;  Luke 1:15 ). In its ordinary form, however, the Nazarite's vow lasted only thirty, and at most one hundred, days. (See RECHABITES .) </p><p> This institution was a symbol of a life devoted to God and separated from all sin, a holy life. </p>
Neah	<p>shaking, or settlement, or descent, a town on the east side of Zebulun, not far from Rimmon ( Joshua 19:13 ).  </p>
Neapolis	<p>new city, a town in Thrace at which Paul first landed in Europe ( Acts 16:11 ). It was the sea-port of the inland town of Philippi, which was distant about 10 miles. From this port Paul embarked on his last journey to Jerusalem ( Acts 20:6 ). It is identified with the modern Turco-Grecian Kavalla.  </p>
Nebaioth	<p>height. </p><li> Ishmael's eldest son ( Genesis 25:13 ), and the prince of an Israelitish tribe (16). He had a sister, Mahalath, who was one of Esau's wives ( Genesis 28:9 ;  36:3 ).  </li><li> The name of the Ishmaelite tribe descended from the above ( Genesis 25:13 Genesis 25:18 ). The "rams of Nebaioth" ( Isaiah 60:7 ) are the gifts which these wandering tribes of the desert would consecrate to God.   </li>
Neballat	<p>wickedness in secret, ( Nehemiah 11:34 ), probably the village of Beit Nebala, about 4 miles north of Lydda.  </p>
Nebat	<p>sight; aspect, the father of Jeroboam, the king of Israel ( 1 Kings 11:26 , etc.).  </p>
Nebo	<p>proclaimer; prophet. </p><li> A Chaldean god whose worship was introduced into Assyria by Pul ( Isaiah 46:1 ;  Jeremiah 48:1 ). To this idol was dedicated the great temple whose ruins are still seen at Birs Nimrud. A statue of Nebo found at Calah, where it was set up by Pul, king of Assyria, is now in the British Museum.  </li><li> A mountain in the land of Moab from which Moses looked for the first and the last time on the Promised Land ( Deuteronomy 32:49 ;  34:1 ). It has been identified with Jebel Nebah, on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea, near its northern end, and about 5 miles south-west of Heshbon. It was the summit of the ridge of Pisgah (q.v.), which was a part of the range of the "mountains of Abarim." It is about 2,643 feet in height, but from its position it commands a view of Western Palestine. Close below it are the plains of Moab, where Balaam, and afterwards Moses, saw the tents of Israel spread along.  </li><li> A town on the east of Jordan which was taken possession of and rebuilt by the tribe of Reuben ( Numbers 32:3 Numbers 32:38 ;  1 Chronicles 5:8 ). It was about 8 miles south of Heshbon.  </li><li> The "children of Nebo" ( Ezra 2:29 ;  Nehemiah 7:33 ) were of those who returned from Babylon. It was a town in Benjamin, probably the modern Beit Nubah, about 7 miles north-west of Hebron.   </li>
Nebuchadnezzar	<p>in the Babylonian orthography Nabu-kudur-uzur, which means "Nebo, protect the crown!" or the "frontiers." In an inscription he styles himself "Nebo's favourite." He was the son and successor of Nabopolassar, who delivered Babylon from its dependence on Assyria and laid Nineveh in ruins. He was the greatest and most powerful of all the Babylonian kings. He married the daughter of Cyaxares, and thus the Median and Babylonian dynasties were united. </p><p> Necho II., the king of Egypt, gained a victory over the Assyrians at Carchemish. (See JOSIAH; MEGIDDO .) This secured to Egypt the possession of the Syrian provinces of Assyria, including Palestine. The remaining provinces of the Assyrian empire were divided between Babylonia and Media. But Nabopolassar was ambitious of reconquering from Necho the western provinces of Syria, and for this purpose he sent his son with a powerful army westward ( Daniel 1:1 ). The Egyptians met him at Carchemish, where a furious battle was fought, resulting in the complete rout of the Egyptians, who were driven back ( Jeremiah 46:2-12 ), and Syria and Phoenicia brought under the sway of Babylon (B.C. 606). From that time "the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land" ( 2 Kings 24:7 ). Nebuchadnezzar also subdued the whole of Palestine, and took Jerusalem, carrying away captive a great multitude of the Jews, among whom were Daniel and his companions ( Daniel 1:1 Daniel 1:2 ;  Jeremiah 27:19 ;  40:1 ).  </p><p> Three years after this, Jehoiakim, who had reigned in Jerusalem as a Babylonian vassal, rebelled against the oppressor, trusting to help from Egypt ( 2 Kings 24:1 ). This led Nebuchadnezzar to march an army again to the conquest of Jerusalem, which at once yielded to him (B.C. 598). A third time he came against it, and deposed Jehoiachin, whom he carried into Babylon, with a large portion of the population of the city, and the sacred vessels of the temple, placing Zedekiah on the throne of Judah in his stead. He also, heedless of the warnings of the prophet, entered into an alliance with Egypt, and rebelled against Babylon. This brought about the final siege of the city, which was at length taken and utterly destroyed (B.C. 586). Zedekiah was taken captive, and had his eyes put out by order of the king of Babylon, who made him a prisoner for the remainder of his life.  </p><p> An onyx cameo, now in the museum of Florence, bears on it an arrow-headed inscription, which is certainly ancient and genuine. The helmeted profile is said (Schrader) to be genuine also, but it is more probable that it is the portrait of a usurper in the time of Darius (Hystaspes), called Nidinta-Bel, who took the name of "Nebuchadrezzar." The inscription has been thus translated:, "In honour of Merodach, his lord, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, in his lifetime had this made." </p><p> A clay tablet, now in the British Museum, bears the following inscription, the only one as yet found which refers to his wars: "In the thirty-seventh year of Nebuchadnezzar, king of the country of Babylon, he went to Egypt [Misr] to make war. Amasis, king of Egypt, collected [his army], and marched and spread abroad." Thus were fulfilled the words of the prophet ( Jeremiah 46:13-26 ;  Ezekiel 29:2-20 ). Having completed the subjugation of Phoenicia, and inflicted chastisement on Egypt, Nebuchadnezzar now set himself to rebuild and adorn the city of Babylon ( Daniel 4:30 ), and to add to the greatness and prosperity of his kingdom by constructing canals and aqueducts and reservoirs surpassing in grandeur and magnificence everything of the kind mentioned in history ( Daniel 2:37 ). He is represented as a "king of kings," ruling over a vast kingdom of many provinces, with a long list of officers and rulers under him, "princes, governors, captains," etc. ( Daniel 3:2 Daniel 3:3 Daniel 3:27 ). He may, indeed, be said to have created the mighty empire over which he ruled.  </p><p> "Modern research has shown that Nebuchadnezzar was the greatest monarch that Babylon, or perhaps the East generally, ever produced. He must have possessed an enormous command of human labour, nine-tenths of Babylon itself, and nineteen-twentieths of all the other ruins that in almost countless profusion cover the land, are composed of bricks stamped with his name. He appears to have built or restored almost every city and temple in the whole country. His inscriptions give an elaborate account of the immense works which he constructed in and about Babylon itself, abundantly illustrating the boast, 'Is not this great Babylon which I have build?'" Rawlinson, Hist. Illustrations. </p><p> After the incident of the "burning fiery furnace" ( Daniel 3 ) into which the three Hebrew confessors were cast, Nebuchadnezzar was afflicted with some peculiar mental aberration as a punishment for his pride and vanity, probably the form of madness known as lycanthropy (i.e, "the change of a man into a wolf"). A remarkable confirmation of the Scripture narrative is afforded by the recent discovery of a bronze door-step, which bears an inscription to the effect that it was presented by Nebuchadnezzar to the great temple at Borsippa as a votive offering on account of his recovery from a terrible illness. (See DANIEL .) </p><p> He survived his recovery for some years, and died B.C. 562, in the eighty-third or eighty-fourth year of his age, after a reign of forty-three years, and was succeeded by his son Evil-merodach, who, after a reign of two years, was succeeded by Neriglissar (559-555), who was succeeded by Nabonadius (555-538), at the close of whose reign (less than a quarter of a century after the death of Nebuchadnezzar) Babylon fell under Cyrus at the head of the combined armies of Media and Persia.  </p><p> "I have examined," says Sir H. Rawlinson, "the bricks belonging perhaps to a hundred different towns and cities in the neighbourhood of Baghdad, and I never found any other legend than that of Nebuchadnezzar, son of Nabopolassar, king of Babylon." Nine-tenths of all the bricks amid the ruins of Babylon are stamped with his name. </p>
Nebuchadrezzar	<p>=Nebuchadnezzar ( Jeremiah 21:2 Jeremiah 21:7 ;  22:25 ;  24:1 , etc.), a nearer approach to the correct spelling of the word.  </p>
Nebushasban	<p>adorer of Nebo, or Nebo saves me, the "Rabsaris," or chief chamberlain, of the court of Babylon. He was one of those whom the king sent to release Jeremiah from prison in Jerusalem ( Jeremiah 39:13 ).  </p>
Nebuzaradan	<p>"the captain of the guard," in rank next to the king, who appears prominent in directing affairs at the capture of Jerusalem ( 2 Kings 25:8-20 ;  Jeremiah 39:11 ;  40:2-5 ). He showed kindness toward Jeremiah, as commanded by Nebuchadnezzar ( 40:1 ). Five years after this he again came to Jerusalem and carried captive seven hundred and forty-five more Jews.  </p>
Necho II	<p>an Egyptian king, the son and successor of Psammetichus (B.C. 610-594), the contemporary of Josiah, king of Judah. For some reason he proclaimed war against the king of Assyria. He led forth a powerful army and marched northward, but was met by the king of Judah at Megiddo, who refused him a passage through his territory. Here a fierce battle was fought and Josiah was slain ( 2 Chronicles 35:20-24 ). Possibly, as some suppose, Necho may have brought his army by sea to some port to the north of Dor (Compare  Joshua 11:2 ;  12:23 ), a Phoenician town at no great distance from Megiddo. After this battle Necho marched on to Carchemish (q.v.), where he met and conquered the Assyrian army, and thus all the Syrian provinces, including Palestine, came under his dominion.  </p><p> On his return march he deposed Jehoahaz, who had succeeded his father Josiah, and made Eliakim, Josiah's eldest son, whose name he changed into Jehoiakim, king. Jehoahaz he carried down into Egypt, where he died ( 2 Kings 23:31 ;  2 Chr  36:1-4 ). Four years after this conquest Necho again marched to the Euphrates; but here he was met and his army routed by the Chaldeans (B.C. 606) under Nebuchadnezzar, who drove the Egyptians back, and took from them all the territory they had conquered, from the Euphrates unto the "river of Egypt" ( Jeremiah 46:2 ;  2 Kings  Jeremiah 24:7 Jeremiah 24:8 ). Soon after this Necho died, and was succeeded by his son, Psammetichus II. (See NEBUCHADNEZZAR .) </p>
Neck	<p>used sometimes figuratively. To "lay down the neck" ( Romans 16:4 ) is to hazard one's life. Threatenings of coming judgments are represented by the prophets by their laying bands upon the people's necks ( Deuteronomy 28:48 ;  Isaiah 10:27 ;  Jeremiah 27:2 ). Conquerors put their feet on the necks of their enemies as a sign of their subjection ( Joshua 10:24 ;  2 Sam  22:41 ).  </p>
Necromancer	<p>( Deuteronomy 15:11 ), i.e., "one who interrogates the dead," as the word literally means, with the view of discovering the secrets of futurity (Compare  1 Samuel 28:7 ). (See DIVINATION .) </p>
Nedabiah	<p>moved of Jehovah, one of the sons of Jeconiah ( 1 Chronicles 3:18 ).  </p>
Needle	<p>used only in the proverb, "to pass through a needle's eye" ( Matthew 19:24 ;  Mark 10:25 ;  Luke 18:25 ). Some interpret the expression as referring to the side gate, close to the principal gate, usually called the "eye of a needle" in the East; but it is rather to be taken literally. The Hebrew females were skilled in the use of the needle ( Exodus 28:39 ;  26:36 ;  Judges 5:30 ).  </p>
Neginah	<p>in the title of  Psalms 61 , denotes the music of stringed instruments ( 1 Samuel 16:16 ;  Isaiah 38:20 ). It is the singular form of Neginoth.  </p>
Neginoth	<p>i.e., songs with instrumental accompaniment, found in the titles of  Psalms 4 ;  6 ;  54 ;  55 ;  67 ;  76 ; rendered "stringed instruments,"  Habakkuk 3:19 , A.V. It denotes all kinds of stringed instruments, as the "harp," "psaltery," "viol," etc. The "chief musician on Neginoth" is the leader of that part of the temple choir which played on stringed instruments.  </p>
Nehelamite	<p>the name given to a false prophet Shemaiah, who went with the captives to Babylon ( Jeremiah 29:24 Jeremiah 29:31 Jeremiah 29:32 ). The origin of the name is unknown. It is rendered in the marg, "dreamer."  </p>
Nehemiah	<p>comforted by Jehovah. </p><li> Ezra 2:2 ;  Nehemiah 7:7 . </li><li> Nehemiah 3:16 .  </li><li> The son of Hachaliah ( Nehemiah 1:1 ), and probably of the tribe of Judah. His family must have belonged to Jerusalem ( Nehemiah 2:3 ). He was one of the "Jews of the dispersion," and in his youth was appointed to the important office of royal cup-bearer at the palace of Shushan. The king, Artaxerxes Longimanus, seems to have been on terms of friendly familiarity with his attendant. Through his brother Hanani, and perhaps from other sources ( Nehemiah 1:2 ;  2:3 ), he heard of the mournful and desolate condition of the Holy City, and was filled with sadness of heart. For many days he fasted and mourned and prayed for the place of his fathers' sepulchres. At length the king observed his sadness of countenance and asked the reason of it. Nehemiah explained it all to the king, and obtained his permission to go up to Jerusalem and there to act as <i> tirshatha</i> , or governor of Judea. He went up in the spring of B.C. 446 (eleven years after Ezra), with a strong escort supplied by the king, and with letters to all the pashas of the provinces through which he had to pass, as also to Asaph, keeper of the royal forests, directing him to assist Nehemiah. On his arrival he set himself to survey the city, and to form a plan for its restoration; a plan which he carried out with great skill and energy, so that the whole was completed in about six months. He remained in Judea for thirteen years as governor, carrying out many reforms, notwithstanding much opposition that he encountered ( Nehemiah 13:11 ). He built up the state on the old lines, "supplementing and completing the work of Ezra," and making all arrangements for the safety and good government of the city. At the close of this important period of his public life, he returned to Persia to the service of his royal master at Shushan or Ecbatana. Very soon after this the old corrupt state of things returned, showing the worthlessness to a large extent of the professions that had been made at the feast of the dedication of the walls of the city ( Nehemiah 12 . See EZRA). Malachi now appeared among the people with words of stern reproof and solemn warning; and Nehemiah again returned from Persia (after an absence of some two years), and was grieved to see the widespread moral degeneracy that had taken place during his absence. He set himself with vigour to rectify the flagrant abuses that had sprung up, and restored the orderly administration of public worship and the outward observance of the law of Moses. Of his subsequent history we know nothing. Probably he remained at his post as governor till his death (about B.C. 413) in a good old age. The place of his death and burial is, however, unknown. "He resembled Ezra in his fiery zeal, in his active spirit of enterprise, and in the piety of his life: but he was of a bluffer and a fiercer mood; he had less patience with transgressors; he was a man of action rather than a man of thought, and more inclined to use force than persuasion. His practical sagacity and high courage were very markedly shown in the arrangement with which he carried through the rebuilding of the wall and balked the cunning plans of the 'adversaries.' The piety of his heart, his deeply religious spirit and constant sense of communion with and absolute dependence upon God, are strikingly exhibited, first in the long prayer recorded in ch.  1:5-11 , and secondly and most remarkably in what have been called his 'interjectional prayers', those short but moving addresses to Almighty God which occur so frequently in his writings, the instinctive outpouring of a heart deeply moved, but ever resting itself upon God, and looking to God alone for aid in trouble, for the frustration of evil designs, and for final reward and acceptance" (Rawlinson). Nehemiah was the last of the governors sent from the Persian court. Judea after this was annexed to the satrapy of Coele-Syria, and was governed by the high priest under the jurisdiction of the governor of Syria, and the internal government of the country became more and more a hierarchy.   </li>
Oak	<p>There are six Hebrew words rendered "oak." </p><li> 'El occurs only in the word El-paran ( Genesis 14:6 ). The LXX. renders by "terebinth." In the plural form this word occurs in  Isaiah 1:29 ;  57:5  (A.V. marg. and RSV, "among the oaks");  61:3  ("trees"). The word properly means strongly, mighty, and hence a strong tree.  </li><li> 'Elah,  Genesis 35:4 , "under the oak which was by Shechem" (RSV marg., "terebinth").  Isaiah 6:13 , A.V., "teil-tree;" RSV, "terebinth."  Isaiah 1:30 , RSV marg., "terebinth." Absalom in his flight was caught in the branches of a "great oak" ( 2 Samuel 18:9 ; RSV marg., "terebinth").  </li><li> 'Elon,  Judges 4:11 ;  9:6  (RSV, "oak;" A.V., following the Targum, "plain") properly the deciduous species of oak shedding its foliage in autumn.  </li><li> 'Elan, only in  Daniel 4:11 Daniel 4:14 Daniel 4:20 , rendered "tree" in Nebuchadnezzar's dream. Probably some species of the oak is intended.  </li><li> 'Allah,  Joshua 24:26 . The place here referred to is called Allon-moreh ("the oak of Moreh," as in RSV) in  Genesis 12:6  and  35:4 .  </li><li> 'Allon, always rendered "oak." Probably the evergreen oak (called also ilex and holm oak) is intended. The oak woods of Bashan are frequently alluded to ( Isaiah 2:13 ;  Ezekiel 27:6 ). Three species of oaks are found in Palestine, of which the "prickly evergreen oak" (Quercus coccifera) is the most abundant. "It covers the rocky hills of Palestine with a dense brushwood of trees from 8 to 12 feet high, branching from the base, thickly covered with small evergreen rigid leaves, and bearing acorns copiously." The so-called Abraham's oak at Hebron is of this species. Tristram says that this oak near Hebron "has for several centuries taken the place of the once renowned terebinth which marked the site of Mamre on the other side of the city. The terebinth existed at Mamre in the time of Vespasian, and under it the captive Jews were sold as slaves. It disappeared about A.D. 330, and no tree now marks the grove of Mamre. The present oak is the noblest tree in Southern Palestine, being 23 feet in girth, and the diameter of the foliage, which is unsymmetrical, being about 90 feet." (See HEBRON; TEIL-TREE.)   </li>
Oath	<p>a solemn appeal to God, permitted on fitting occasions ( Deuteronomy 6:13 ;  Jeremiah 4:2 ), in various forms ( Genesis 16:5 ;  2 Sam  12:5 ;  Ruth 1:17 ;  Hosea 4:15 ;  Romans 1:9 ), and taken in different ways ( Genesis 14:22 ;  24:2 ;  2 Chr  6:22 ). God is represented as taking an oath ( Hebrews 6:16-18 ), so also Christ ( Matthew 26:64 ), and Paul ( Romans 9:1 ;  Galatians 1:20 ; Phil  1:8 ). The precept, "Swear not at all," refers probably to ordinary conversation between man and man ( Matthew 5:34 Matthew 5:37 ). But if the words are taken as referring to oaths, then their intention may have been to show "that the proper state of Christians is to require no oaths; that when evil is expelled from among them every yea and nay will be as decisive as an oath, every promise as binding as a vow."  </p>
Obadiah	<p>servant of the Lord. </p><li> An Israelite who was chief in the household of King Ahab ( 1 Kings 18:3 ). Amid great spiritual degeneracy he maintained his fidelity to God, and interposed to protect The Lord's prophets, an hundred of whom he hid at great personal risk in a cave (4,13). Ahab seems to have held Obadiah in great honour, although he had no sympathy with his piety (5,6,7). The last notice of him is his bringing back tidings to Ahab that Elijah, whom he had so long sought for, was at hand (9-16). "Go," said Elijah to him, when he met him in the way, "go tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here."  </li><li> A chief of the tribe of Issachar ( 1 Chronicles 7:3 ).  </li><li> A descendant of Saul ( 1 Chronicles 8:38 ).  </li><li> A Levite, after the Captivity ( 1 Chronicles 9:16 ).  </li><li> A Gadite who joined David at Ziklag ( 1 Chronicles 12:9 ).  </li><li> A prince of Zebulun in the time of David ( 1 Chronicles 27:19 ).  </li><li> One of the princes sent by Jehoshaphat to instruct the people in the law ( 2 Chronicles 17:7 ).  </li><li> A Levite who superintended the repairs of the temple under Josiah ( 2 Chronicles 34:12 ).  </li><li> One who accompanied Ezra on the return from Babylon ( Ezra 8:9 ).  </li><li> A prophet, fourth of the minor prophets in the Hebrew canon, and fifth in the LXX. He was probably contemporary with Jeremiah and Ezekiel. Of his personal history nothing is known.   </li>
Obadiah, Book of	<p>consists of one chapter, "concerning Edom," its impending doom ( 1:1-16 ), and the restoration of Israel ( 1:17-21 ). This is the shortest book of the Old Testament.  </p><p> There are on record the account of four captures of Jerusalem, (1) by Shishak in the reign of Rehoboam ( 1 Kings 14:25 ); (2) by the Philistines and Arabians in the reign of Jehoram ( 2 Chronicles 21:16 ); (3) by Joash, the king of Israel, in the reign of Amaziah ( 2 Kings 14:13 ); and (4) by the Babylonians, when Jerusalem was taken and destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar (B.C. 586). ( Obadiah 1:11-14 ) speaks of this capture as a thing past. He sees the calamity as having already come on Jerusalem, and the Edomites as joining their forces with those of the Chaldeans in bringing about the degradation and ruin of Israel. We do not indeed read that the Edomites actually took part with the Chaldeans, but the probabilities are that they did so, and this explains the words of Obadiah in denouncing against Edom the judgments of God. The date of his prophecies was thus in or about the year of the destruction of Jerusalem.  </p><p> Edom is the type of Israel's and of God's last foe ( Isaiah 63:1-4 ). These will finally all be vanquished, and the kingdom will be the Lord's (Compare  Psalms 22:28 ).  </p>
Obal	<p>stripped, the eight son of Joktan ( Genesis 10:28 ); called also Ebal ( 1 Chronicles 1:22 ).  </p>
Obed	<p>serving; worshipping. </p><li> A son of Boaz and Ruth ( Ruth 4:21 Ruth 4:22 ), and the grandfather of David ( Matthew 1:5 ).  </li><li> 1 Chronicles 2:34-38 .  </li><li> 1 Chronicles 26:7 .  </li><li> 2 Chronicles 23:1 .   </li>
Obed-Edom	<p>servant of Edom. </p><li> "The Gittite" (probably so called because he was a native of Gath-rimmon), a Levite of the family of the Korhites ( 1 Chronicles 26:1 1 Chronicles 26:4-8 ), to whom was specially intrusted the custody of the ark ( 1 Chronicles 15:18 ). When David was bringing up the ark "from the house of Abinadab, that was in Gibeah" (probably some hill or eminence near Kirjath-jearim), and had reached Nachon's threshing-floor, he became afraid because of the "breach upon Uzzah," and carried it aside into the house of Obededom ( 2 Samuel 6:1-12 ). There it remained for six months, and was to him and his house the occasion of great blessing. David then removed it with great rejoicing to Jerusalem, and set it in the midst of the tabernacle he had pitched for it.  </li><li> A Merarite Levite, a temple porter, who with his eight sons guarded the southern gate ( 1 Chronicles 15:18 1 Chronicles 15:21 ;  1 Chronicles 26:4 1 Chronicles 26:8 1 Chronicles 26:15 ).  </li><li> One who had charge of the temple treasures ( 2 Chronicles 25:24 ).   </li>
Obeisance	<p>homage or reverence to any one ( Genesis 37:7 ;  43:28 ).  </p>
Obil	<p>a keeper of camels, an Ishmaelite who was "over the camels" in the time of David ( 1 Chronicles 27:30 ).  </p>
Oboth	<p>bottles, an encampment of the Israelites during the wanderings in the wilderness ( Numbers 33:43 ), the first after the setting up of the brazen serpent.  </p>
Oded	<p>restoring, or setting up. </p><li> Father of the prophet Azariah ( 2 Chronicles 15:1 2 Chronicles 15:8 ).  </li><li> A prophet in the time of Ahaz and Pekah ( 2 Chronicles 28:9-15 ).   </li>
Offence	<p></p><li> An injury or wrong done to one ( 1 Samuel 25:31 ;  Romans 5:15 ).  </li><li> A stumbling-block or cause of temptation ( Isaiah 8:14 ;  Matthew 16:23 ;  18:7 ). Greek skandalon, properly that at which one stumbles or takes offence. The "offence of the cross" ( Galatians 5:11 ) is the offence the Jews took at the teaching that salvation was by the crucified One, and by him alone. Salvation by the cross was a stumbling-block to their national pride.   </li>
Offering	<p>an oblation, dedicated to God. Thus Cain consecrated to God of the first-fruits of the earth, and Abel of the firstlings of the flock ( Genesis 4:3 Genesis 4:4 ). Under the Levitical system different kinds of offerings are specified, and laws laid down as to their presentation. These are described under their distinctive names.  </p>
Og	<p>gigantic, the king of Bashan, who was defeated by Moses in a pitched battle at Edrei, and was slain along with his sons ( Deuteronomy 1:4 ), and whose kingdom was given to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh ( Numbers 21:32-35 ;  Deuteronomy 3:1-13 ). His bedstead (or rather sarcophagus) was of iron (or ironstone), 9 cubits in length and 4 cubits in breadth. His overthrow was afterwards celebrated in song ( Psalms 135:11 ;  136:20 ). (See SIHON .) </p>
Ohad	<p>united, or power, the third son of Simeon ( Genesis 46:10 ).  </p>
Ohel	<p>a house; tent, the fourth son of Zerubbabel ( 1 Chronicles 3:20 ).  </p>
Oil	<p>Only olive oil seems to have been used among the Hebrews. It was used for many purposes: for anointing the body or the hair ( Exodus 29:7 ;  2 Sam  14:2 ;  Psalms 23:5 ;  92:10 ;  104:15 ;  Luke 7:46 ); in some of the offerings ( Exodus 29:40 ;  Leviticus 7:12 ;  Numbers 6:15 ;  15:4 ), but was excluded from the sin-offering ( Leviticus 5:11 ) and the jealousy-offering ( Numbers 5:15 ); for burning in lamps ( Exodus 25:6 ;  27:20 ;  Matthew 25:3 ); for medicinal purposes ( Isaiah 1:6 ;  Luke 10:34 ;  James 5:14 ); and for anointing the dead ( Matthew 26:12 ;  Luke 23:56 ).  </p><p> It was one of the most valuable products of the country ( Deuteronomy 32:13 ;  Ezekiel 16:13 ), and formed an article of extensive commerce with Tyre ( 27:17 ).  </p><p> The use of it was a sign of gladness ( Psalms 92:10 ;  Isaiah 61:3 ), and its omission a token of sorrow ( 2 Samuel 14:2 ;  Matthew 6:17 ). It was very abundant in Galilee. (See OLIVE .) </p>
Oil-tree	<p>( Isaiah 41:19 ; RSV marg., "oleaster"), Heb. 'etz shemen, rendered "olive tree" in 1Kings 6:23,31,32,33(RSV, "olive wood") and "pine branches" in  Nehemiah 8:15  (RSV, "branches of wild olive"), was some tree distinct from the olive. It was probably the oleaster (Eleagnus angustifolius), which grows abundantly in almost all parts of Palestine, especially about Hebron and Samaria. "It has a fine hard wood," says Tristram, "and yields an inferior oil, but it has no relationship to the olive, which, however, it resembles in general appearance."  </p>
Ointment	<p>Various fragrant preparations, also compounds for medical purposes, are so called ( Exodus 30:25 ;  Psalms 133:2 ;  Isaiah 1:6 ;  Amos 6:6 ;  John 12:3 ;  Revelation 18:13 ).  </p>
Old gate	<p>one of the gates in the north wall of Jerusalem, so called because built by the Jebusites ( Nehemiah 3:6 ;  12:39 ).  </p>
Olive	<p>the fruit of the olive-tree. This tree yielded oil which was highly valued. The best oil was from olives that were plucked before being fully ripe, and then beaten or squeezed ( Deuteronomy 24:20 ;  Isaiah 17:6 ;  24:13 ). It was called "beaten," or "fresh oil" ( Exodus 27:20 ). There were also oil-presses, in which the oil was trodden out by the feet ( Micah 6:15 ). ( James 3:12 ) calls the fruit "olive berries." The phrase "vineyards and olives" (Judg.  15:5 , A.V.) should be simply "olive-yard," or "olive-garden," as in the Revised Version. (See OIL .) </p>
Olive-tree	<p>is frequently mentioned in Scripture. The dove from the ark brought an olive-branch to Noah ( Genesis 8:11 ). It is mentioned among the most notable trees of Palestine, where it was cultivated long before the time of the Hebrews ( Deuteronomy 6:11 ;  8:8 ). It is mentioned in the first Old Testament parable, that of Jotham ( Judges 9:9 ), and is named among the blessings of the "good land," and is at the present day the one characteristic tree of Palestine. The oldest olive-trees in the country are those which are enclosed in the Garden of Gethsemane. It is referred to as an emblem of prosperity and beauty and religious privilege ( Psalms 52:8 ;  Jeremiah 11:16 ;  Hosea 14:6 ). The two "witnesses" mentioned in  Revelation 11:4  are spoken of as "two olive trees standing before the God of the earth." (Compare  Zechariah 4:3 Zechariah 4:11-14 .)  </p><p> The "olive-tree, wild by nature" ( Romans 11:24 ), is the shoot or cutting of the good olive-tree which, left ungrafted, grows up to be a "wild olive." In  Romans 11:17  Paul refers to the practice of grafting shoots of the wild olive into a "good" olive which has become unfruitful. By such a process the sap of the good olive, by pervading the branch which is "graffed in," makes it a good branch, bearing good olives. Thus the Gentiles, being a "wild olive," but now "graffed in," yield fruit, but only through the sap of the tree into which they have been graffed. This is a process "contrary to nature" ( 11:24 ).  </p>
Olves, Mount of	<p>so called from the olive trees with which its sides are clothed, is a mountain ridge on the east of Jerusalem ( 1 Kings 11:7 ;  Ezekiel 11:23 ;  Zechariah 14:4 ), from which it is separated by the valley of Kidron. It is first mentioned in connection with David's flight from Jerusalem through the rebellion of Absalom ( 2 Samuel 15:30 ), and is only once again mentioned in the Old Testament, in  Zechariah 14:4 . It is, however, frequently alluded to ( 1 Kings 11:7 ;  2 Kings  <span class="badLink">23:13</span> ;  Nehemiah 8:15 ;  Ezekiel 11:23 ).  </p><p> It is frequently mentioned in the New Testament ( Matthew 21:1 ;  26:30 , etc.). It now bears the name of Jebel et-Tur, i.e., "Mount of the Summit;" also sometimes called Jebel ez-Zeitun, i.e., "Mount of Olives." It is about 200 feet above the level of the city. The road from Jerusalem to Bethany runs as of old over this mount. It was on this mount that Jesus stood when he wept over Jerusalem. "No name in Scripture," says Dr. Porter, "calls up associations at once so sacred and so pleasing as that of Olivet. The 'mount' is so intimately connected with the private, the devotional life of the Saviour, that we read of it and look at it with feelings of deepest interest and affection. Here he often sat with his disciples, telling them of wondrous events yet to come, of the destruction of the Holy City; of the sufferings, the persecution, and the final triumph of his followers ( Matthew 24 ). Here he gave them the beautiful parables of the ten virgins and the five talents (25); here he was wont to retire on each evening for meditation, and prayer, and rest of body, when weary and harassed by the labours and trials of the day ( Luke 21:37 ); and here he came on the night of his betrayal to utter that wonderful prayer, 'O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt' ( Matthew 26:39 ). And when the cup of God's wrath had been drunk, and death and the grave conquered, he led his disciples out again over Olivet as far as to Bethany, and after a parting blessing ascended to heaven ( Luke 24:50 Luke 24:51 ;  Acts 1:12 )."  </p><p> This mount, or rather mountain range, has four summits or peaks: (1) the "Galilee" peak, so called from a tradition that the angels stood here when they spoke to the disciples ( Acts 1:11 ); (2) the "Mount of Ascension," the supposed site of that event, which was, however, somewhere probably nearer Bethany ( Luke 24:51 Luke 24:52 ); (3) the "Prophets," from the catacombs on its side, called "the prophets' tombs;" and (4) the "Mount of Corruption," so called because of the "high places" erected there by Solomon for the idolatrous worship of his foreign wives ( 1 Kings 11:7 ;  2 Kings  <span class="badLink">23:13</span> ; Vulg., "Mount of Offence").  </p>
Olympas	<p>a Roman Christian whom Paul salutes ( Romans 16:15 ).  </p>
Omar	<p>eloquent, the son of Eliphaz, who was Esau's eldest son ( Genesis 36:11-15 ).  </p>
Omega	<p>( Revelation 1:8 ), the last letter in the Greek alphabet. (See A .) </p>
Omer	<p>a handful, one-tenth of an ephah=half a gallon dry measure (Ex 16:22,32,33,36)="tenth deal."  </p>
Omri	<p>servant of Jehovah. When Elah was murdered by Zimri at Tirzah ( 1 Kings 16:15-27 ), Omri, his captain, was made king (B.C. 931). For four years there was continued opposition to his reign, Tibni, another claimant to the throne, leading the opposing party; but at the close of that period all his rivals were defeated, and he became king of Israel, "Tibni died and Omri reigned" (B.C. 927). By his vigour and power he gained great eminence and consolidated the kingdom. He fixed his dynasty on the throne so firmly that it continued during four succeeding reigns. Tirza was for six years the seat of his government. He then removed the capital to Samaria (q.v.), where he died, and was succeeded by his son Ahab. "He wrought evil in the eyes of the Lord, and did worse than all that were before him."  </p><p> Beth-omri, "the house" or "city of Omri," is the name usually found on Assyrian inscriptions for Samaria. In the stele of Mesha (the "Moabite stone"), which was erected in Moab about twenty or thirty years after Omri's death, it is recorded that Omri oppressed Moab till Mesha delivered the land: "Omri, king of Israel, oppressed Moab many days, for Chemosh was angry with his land. His son succeeded him, and he also said, I will oppress Moab" (Compare  2 Kings 1:1 ;  2 Kings 3:4 2 Kings 3:5 ). The "Moabite stone" also records that "Omri took the land of Medeba, and occupied it in his day and in the days of his son forty years."  </p>
On	<p>light; the sun, ( Genesis 41:45 Genesis 41:50 ), the great seat of sun-worship, called also Bethshemesh ( Jeremiah 43:13 ) and Aven ( Ezekiel 30:17 ), stood on the east bank of the Nile, a few miles north of Memphis, and near Cairo, in the north-east. The Vulgate and the LXX. Versions have "Heliopolis" ("city of the sun") instead of On in Genesis and of Aven in Ezekiel. The "city of destruction" Isaiah speaks of ( 19:18 , marg. "of Heres;" Heb. 'Ir-ha-heres, which some MSS. read Ir-ha-heres, i.e., "city of the sun") may be the name given to On, the prophecy being that the time will come when that city which was known as the "city of the sun-god" shall become the "city of destruction" of the sun-god, i.e., when idolatry shall cease, and the worship of the true God be established.  </p><p> In ancient times this city was full of obelisks dedicated to the sun. Of these only one now remains standing. "Cleopatra's Needle" was one of those which stood in this city in front of the Temple of Tum, i.e., "the sun." It is now erected on the Thames Embankment, London. </p><p> "It was at On that Joseph wooed and won the dark-skinned Asenath, the daughter of the high priest of its great temple." This was a noted university town, and here Moses gained his acquaintance with "all the wisdom of the Egyptians." </p>
Onan	<p>strong, the second son of Judah ( Genesis 38:4-10 ; Compare  Deuteronomy 25:5 ;  Matthew 22:24 ). He died before the going down of Jacob and his family into Egypt.  </p>
Onesimus	<p>useful, a slave who, after robbing his master Philemon (q.v.) at Colosse, fled to Rome, where he was converted by the apostle Paul, who sent him back to his master with the epistle which bears his name. In it he beseeches Philemon to receive his slave as a "faithful and beloved brother." Paul offers to pay to Philemon anything his slave had taken, and to bear the wrong he had done him. He was accompanied on his return by Tychicus, the bearer of the Epistle to the Colossians ( Philemon 1:16 Philemon 1:18 ).  </p><p> The story of this fugitive Colossian slave is a remarkable evidence of the freedom of access to the prisoner which was granted to all, and "a beautiful illustration both of the character of St. Paul and the transfiguring power and righteous principles of the gospel." </p>
Onesiphorus	<p>bringing profit, an Ephesian Christian who showed great kindness to Paul at Rome. He served him in many things, and had oft refreshed him. Paul expresses a warm interest in him and his household ( 2 Timothy 1:16-18 ;  4:19 ).  </p>
Paarai	<p>opening of the Lord, "the Arbite," one of David's heroes ( 2 Samuel 23:35 ); called also Naarai,  1 Chronicles 11:37 .  </p>
Padan	<p>a plain, occurring only in  Genesis 48:7 , where it designates Padan-aram.  </p>
Padan-aram	<p>the plain of Aram, or the plain of the highlands, ( Genesis 25:20 ;  Genesis 28:2 Genesis 28:5-7 ;  31:18 , etc.), commonly regarded as the district of Mesopotamia (q.v.) lying around Haran.  </p>
Pagiel	<p>God allots, a prince of the tribe of Asher ( Numbers 1:13 ), in the wilderness.  </p>
Pahath-moab	<p>governor of Moab, a person whose descendants returned from the Captivity and assisted in rebuilding Jerusalem ( Ezra 2:6 ;  8:4 ;  10:30 ).  </p>
Paint	<p>Jezebel "painted her face" ( 2 Kings 9:30 ); and the practice of painting the face and the eyes seems to have been common ( Jeremiah 4:30 ;  Ezekiel 23:40 ). An allusion to this practice is found in the name of Job's daughter ( 42:14 ) Kerenhappuch (q.v.). Paintings in the modern sense of the word were unknown to the ancient Jews.  </p>
Palace	<p>Used now only of royal dwellings, although originally meaning simply (as the Latin word palatium, from which it is derived, shows) a building surrounded by a fence or a paling. In the Authorized Version there are many different words so rendered, presenting different ideas, such as that of citadel or lofty fortress or royal residence ( Nehemiah 1:1 ;  Daniel 8:2 ). It is the name given to the temple fortress ( Nehemiah 2:8 ) and to the temple itself ( 1 Chronicles 29:1 ). It denotes also a spacious building or a great house ( Daniel 1:4 ;  Daniel 4:4 Daniel 4:29 :  Esther 1:5 ;  7:7 ), and a fortified place or an enclosure ( Ezekiel 25:4 ). Solomon's palace is described in  1 Kings 7:1-12  as a series of buildings rather than a single great structure. Thirteen years were spent in their erection. This palace stood on the eastern hill, adjoining the temple on the south.  </p><p> In the New Testament it designates the official residence of Pilate or that of the high priest ( Matthew 26:3 Matthew 26:58 Matthew 26:69 ;  Mark 14:54 Mark 14:66 ;  John 18:15 ). In Phil  1:13  this word is the rendering of the Greek praitorion, meaning the praetorian cohorts at Rome (the life-guard of the Caesars). Paul was continually chained to a soldier of that corps ( Acts 28:16 ), and hence his name and sufferings became known in all the praetorium. The "soldiers that kept" him would, on relieving one another on guard, naturally spread the tidings regarding him among their comrades. Some, however, regard the praetroium (q.v.) as the barrack within the palace (the palatium) of the Caesars in Rome where a detachment of these praetorian guards was stationed, or as the camp of the guards placed outside the eastern walls of Rome.  </p><p> "In the chambers which were occupied as guard-rooms," says Dr. Manning, "by the praetorian troops on duty in the palace, a number of rude caricatures are found roughly scratched upon the walls, just such as may be seen upon barrack walls in every part of the world. Amongst these is one of a human figure nailed upon a cross. To add to the 'offence of the cross,' the crucified one is represented with the head of an animal, probably that of an ass. Before it stands the figure of a Roman legionary with one hand upraised in the attitude of worship. Underneath is the rude, misspelt, ungrammatical inscription, Alexamenos worships his god. It can scarcely be doubted that we have here a contemporary caricature, executed by one of the praetorian guard, ridiculing the faith of a Christian comrade." </p>
Palestine	<p>originally denoted only the sea-coast of the land of Canaan inhabited by the Philistines ( Exodus 15:14 ;  Isaiah 14:29 Isaiah 14:31 ;  Joel 3:4 ), and in this sense exclusively the Hebrew name Pelesheth (rendered "Philistia" in  Psalms 60:8 ;  83:7 ;  87:4 ;  108:9 ) occurs in the Old Testament.  </p><p> Not till a late period in Jewish history was this name used to denote "the land of the Hebrews" in general ( Genesis 40:15 ). It is also called "the holy land" ( Zechariah 2:12 ), the "land of Jehovah" ( Hosea 9:3 ;  Psalms 85:1 ), the "land of promise" ( Hebrews 11:9 ), because promised to Abraham ( Genesis 12:7 ;  24:7 ), the "land of Canaan" ( Genesis 12:5 ), the "land of Israel" ( 1 Samuel 13:19 ), and the "land of Judah" ( Isaiah 19:17 ).  </p><p> The territory promised as an inheritance to the seed of Abraham ( Genesis 15:18-21 ;  Numbers 34:1-12 ) was bounded on the east by the river Euphrates, on the west by the Mediterranean, on the north by the "entrance of Hamath," and on the south by the "river of Egypt." This extent of territory, about 60,000 square miles, was at length conquered by David, and was ruled over also by his son Solomon ( 2 Samuel 8 ;  1 Chronicles 18 ;  1 Kings 4:1 1 Kings 4:21 ). This vast empire was the Promised Land; but Palestine was only a part of it, terminating in the north at the southern extremity of the Lebanon range, and in the south in the wilderness of Paran, thus extending in all to about 144 miles in length. Its average breadth was about 60 miles from the Mediterranean on the west to beyond the Jordan. It has fittingly been designated "the least of all lands." Western Palestine, on the south of Gaza, is only about 40 miles in breadth from the Mediterranean to the Dead Sea, narrowing gradually toward the north, where it is only 20 miles from the sea-coast to the Jordan.  </p><p> Palestine, "set in the midst" ( Ezekiel 5:5 ) of all other lands, is the most remarkable country on the face of the earth. No single country of such an extent has so great a variety of climate, and hence also of plant and animal life. Moses describes it as "a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills; a land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey; a land wherein thou shalt not eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass" ( Deuteronomy 8:7-9 ).  </p><p> "In the time of Christ the country looked, in all probability, much as now. The whole land consists of rounded limestone hills, fretted into countless stony valleys, offering but rarely level tracts, of which Esdraelon alone, below Nazareth, is large enough to be seen on the map. The original woods had for ages disappeared, though the slopes were dotted, as now, with figs, olives, and other fruit-trees where there was any soil. Permanent streams were even then unknown, the passing rush of winter torrents being all that was seen among the hills. The autumn and spring rains, caught in deep cisterns hewn out like huge underground jars in the soft limestone, with artificial mud-banked ponds still found near all villages, furnished water. Hills now bare, or at best rough with stunted growth, were then terraced, so as to grow vines, olives, and grain. To-day almost desolate, the country then teemed with population. Wine-presses cut in the rocks, endless terraces, and the ruins of old vineyard towers are now found amidst solitudes overgrown for ages with thorns and thistles, or with wild shrubs and poor gnarled scrub" (Geikie's Life of Christ). </p><p> From an early period the land was inhabited by the descendants of Canaan, who retained possession of the whole land "from Sidon to Gaza" till the time of the conquest by Joshua, when it was occupied by the twelve tribes. Two tribes and a half had their allotments given them by Moses on the east of the Jordan ( Deuteronomy 3:12-20 ; Compare  Numbers 1:17-46 ;  Joshua 4:12-13 ). The remaining tribes had their portion on the west of Jordan.  </p><p> From the conquest till the time of Saul, about four hundred years, the people were governed by judges. For a period of one hundred and twenty years the kingdom retained its unity while it was ruled by Saul and David and Solomon. On the death of Solomon, his son Rehoboam ascended the throne; but his conduct was such that ten of the tribes revolted, and formed an independent monarchy, called the kingdom of Israel, or the northern kingdom, the capital of which was first Shechem and afterwards Samaria. This kingdom was destroyed. The Israelites were carried captive by Shalmanezer, king of Assyria, B.C. 722, after an independent existence of two hundred and fifty-three years. The place of the captives carried away was supplied by tribes brought from the east, and thus was formed the Samaritan nation ( 2 Kings 17:24-29 ).  </p><p> Nebuchadnezzar came up against the kingdom of the two tribes, the kingdom of Judah, the capital of which was Jerusalem, one hundred and thirty-four years after the overthrow of the kingdom of Israel. He overthrew the city, plundered the temple, and carried the people into captivity to Babylon (B.C. 587), where they remained seventy years. At the close of the period of the Captivity, they returned to their own land, under the edict of Cyrus ( Ezra 1:1-4 ). They rebuilt the city and temple, and restored the old Jewish commonwealth.  </p><p> For a while after the Restoration the Jews were ruled by Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah, and afterwards by the high priests, assisted by the Sanhedrin. After the death of Alexander the Great at Babylon (B.C. 323), his vast empire was divided between his four generals. Egypt, Arabia, Palestine, and Coele-Syria fell to the lot of Ptolemy Lagus. Ptolemy took possession of Palestine in B.C. 320, and carried nearly one hundred thousand of the inhabitants of Jerusalem into Egypt. He made Alexandria the capital of his kingdom, and treated the Jews with consideration, confirming them in the enjoyment of many privileges.  </p><p> After suffering persecution at the hands of Ptolemy's successors, the Jews threw off the Egyptian yoke, and became subject to Antiochus the Great, the king of Syria. The cruelty and opression of the successors of Antiochus at length led to the revolt under the Maccabees (B.C. 163), when they threw off the Syrian yoke.  </p><p> In the year B.C. 68, Palestine was reduced by Pompey the Great to a Roman province. He laid the walls of the city in ruins, and massacred some twelve thousand of the inhabitants. He left the temple, however, unijured. About twenty-five years after this the Jews revolted and cast off the Roman yoke. They were however, subdued by Herod the Great (q.v.). The city and the temple were destroyed, and many of the inhabitants were put to death. About B.C. 20, Herod proceeded to rebuild the city and restore the ruined temple, which in about nine years and a half was so far completed that the sacred services could be resumed in it (Compare  John 2:20 ). He was succeeded by his son Archelaus, who was deprived of his power, however, by Augustus, A.D. 6, when Palestine became a Roman province, ruled by Roman governors or procurators. Pontius Pilate was the fifth of these procurators. He was appointed to his office A.D. 25.  </p><p> Exclusive of Idumea, the kingdom of Herod the Great comprehended the whole of the country originally divided among the twelve tribes, which he divided into four provinces or districts. This division was recognized so long as Palestine was under the Roman dominion. These four provinces were, (1) Judea, the southern portion of the country; (2) Samaria, the middle province, the northern boundary of which ran along the hills to the south of the plain of Esdraelon; (3) Galilee, the northern province; and (4) Peraea (a Greek name meaning the "opposite country"), the country lying east of the Jordan and the Dead Sea. This province was subdivided into these districts, (1) Peraea proper, lying between the rivers Arnon and Jabbok; (2) Galaaditis (Gilead); (3) Batanaea; (4) Gaulonitis (Jaulan); (5) Ituraea or Auranitis, the ancient Bashan; (6) Trachonitis; (7) Abilene; (8) Decapolis, i.e., the region of the ten cities. The whole territory of Palestine, including the portions alloted to the trans-Jordan tribes, extended to about eleven thousand square miles. Recent exploration has shown the territory on the west of Jordan alone to be six thousand square miles in extent, the size of the principality of Wales.  </p>
Pallu	<p>separated, the second son of Reuben ( 1 Chronicles 5:3 ); called Phallu,  Genesis 46:9 . He was the father of the Phalluites ( Exodus 6:14 ;  Numbers 26:5 Numbers 26:8 ).  </p>
Palm tree	<p>(Heb. tamar), the date-palm characteristic of Palestine. It is described as "flourishing" ( Psalms 92:12 ), tall (Cant  7:7 ), "upright" ( Jeremiah 10:5 ). Its branches are a symbol of victory ( Revelation 7:9 ). "Rising with slender stem 40 or 50, at times even 80, feet aloft, its only branches, the feathery, snow-like, pale-green fronds from 6 to 12 feet long, bending from its top, the palm attracts the eye wherever it is seen." The whole land of Palestine was called by the Greeks and Romans Phoenicia, i.e., "the land of palms." Tadmor in the desert was called by the Greeks and Romans Palmyra, i.e., "the city of palms." The finest specimens of this tree grew at Jericho ( Deuteronomy 34:3 ) and Engedi and along the banks of the Jordan. Branches of the palm tree were carried at the feast of Tabernacles ( Leviticus 23:40 ). At our Lord's triumphal entrance into Jerusalem the crowds took palm branches, and went forth to meet him, crying, "Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord" ( Matthew 21:8 ;  John 12:13 ). (See DATE .) </p>
Palm trees, The city of	<p>the name given to Jericho (q.v.),  Deuteronomy 34:3 ;  Judges 1:16 ;  3:13 .  </p>
Palmer-worm	<p>(Heb. gazam). The English word may denote either a caterpillar (as rendered by the LXX.), which wanders like a palmer or pilgrim, or which travels like pilgrims in bands ( Joel 1:4 ;  2:25 ), the wingless locusts, or the migratory locust in its larva state.  </p>
Palsy	<p>a shorter form of "paralysis." Many persons thus afflicted were cured by our Lord ( Matthew 4:24 ;  8:5-13 ;  9:2-7 ;  Mark 2:3-11 ;  Luke 7:2-10 ;  John 5:5-7 ) and the apostles ( Acts 8:7 ;  Acts 9:33 Acts 9:34 ).  </p>
Palti	<p>deliverance from the Lord, one of the spies representing the tribe of Benjamin ( Numbers 13:9 ).  </p>
Paltiel	<p>deliverance of God, the prince of Issachar who assisted "to divide the land by inheritance" ( Numbers 34:26 ).  </p>
Paltite	<p>the designation of one of David's heroes ( 2 Samuel 23:26 ); called also the Pelonite ( 1 Chronicles 11:27 ).  </p>
Pamphylia	<p>Paul and his company, loosing from Paphos, sailed north-west and came to Perga, the capital of Pamphylia ( Acts 13:13 Acts 13:14 ), a province about the middle of the southern sea-board of Asia Minor. It lay between Lycia on the west and Cilicia on the east. There were strangers from Pamphylia at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost ( 2:10 ).  </p>
Pan	<p>a vessel of metal or earthenware used in culinary operations; a cooking-pan or frying-pan frequently referred to in the Old Testament ( Leviticus 2:5 ;  6:21 ;  Numbers 11:8 ;  1 Samuel 2:14 , etc.).  </p><p> The "ash-pans" mentioned in  Exodus 27:3  were made of copper, and were used in connection with the altar of burnt-offering. The "iron pan" mentioned in  Ezekiel 4:3  (marg., "flat plate " or "slice") was probably a mere plate of iron used for baking. The "fire-pans" of  Exodus 27:3  were fire-shovels used for taking up coals. The same Hebrew word is rendered "snuff-dishes" ( 25:38 ;  37:23 ) and "censers" ( Leviticus 10:1 ;  16:12 ;  Numbers 4:14 , etc.). These were probably simply metal vessels employed for carrying burning embers from the brazen altar to the altar of incense.  </p><p> The "frying-pan" mentioned in  Leviticus 2:7 ;  7:9  was a pot for boiling.  </p>
Pannag	<p>( Ezekiel 27:17 ; marg. RSV, "perhaps a kind of confection") the Jews explain as the name of a kind of sweet pastry. Others take it as the name of some place, identifying it with Pingi, on the road between Damascus and Baalbec. "Pannaga" is the Sanscrit name of an aromatic plant (Compare  Genesis 43:11 ).  </p>
Paper	<p>The expression in the Authorized Version ( Isaiah 19:7 ), "the paper reeds by the brooks," is in the Revised Version more correctly "the meadows by the Nile." The words undoubtedly refer to a grassy place on the banks of the Nile fit for pasturage.  </p><p> In  2 John 1:12  the word is used in its proper sense. The material so referred to was manufactured from the papyrus, and hence its name. The papyrus (Heb. gome) was a kind of bulrush (q.v.). It is mentioned by ( Job 8:11 ) and ( Isaiah 35:7 ). It was used for many purposes. This plant (Papyrus Nilotica) is now unknown in Egypt; no trace of it can be found. The unaccountable disappearance of this plant from Egypt was foretold by ( Isaiah 19:6 Isaiah 19:7 ) as a part of the divine judgment on that land. The most extensive papyrus growths now known are in the marshes at the northern end of the lake of Merom.  </p>
Paphos	<p>the capital of the island of Cyprus, and therefore the residence of the Roman governor. It was visited by Paul and Barnabas on their first missionary tour ( Acts 13:6 ). It is new Paphos which is here meant. It lay on the west coast of the island, about 8 miles north of old Paphos. Its modern name is Baffa.  </p>
Parable	<p>(Gr. parabole), a placing beside; a comparison; equivalent to the Heb. mashal, a similitude. In the Old Testament this is used to denote (1) a proverb ( 1 Samuel 10:12 ;  24:13 ;  2 Chr  7:20 ), (2) a prophetic utterance ( Numbers 23:7 ;  Ezekiel 20:49 ), (3) an enigmatic saying ( Psalms 78:2 ;  Proverbs 1:6 ). In the New Testament, (1) a proverb ( Mark 7:17 ;  Luke 4:23 ), (2) a typical emblem ( Hebrews 9:9 ;  11:19 ), (3) a similitude or allegory ( Matthew 15:15 ;  24:32 ;  Mark 3:23 ;  Luke 5:36 ;  14:7 ); (4) ordinarily, in a more restricted sense, a comparison of earthly with heavenly things, "an earthly story with a heavenly meaning," as in the parables of our Lord.  </p><p> Instruction by parables has been in use from the earliest times. A large portion of our Lord's public teaching consisted of parables. He himself explains his reasons for this in his answer to the inquiry of the disciples, "Why speakest thou to them in parables?" ( Matthew 13:13-15 ;  Mark 4:11 Mark 4:12 ;  Luke 8:9 Luke 8:10 ). He followed in so doing the rule of the divine procedures, as recorded in  Matthew 13:13 .  </p><p> The parables uttered by our Lord are all recorded in the synoptical (i.e., the first three) Gospels. The fourth Gospel contains no parable properly so called, although the illustration of the good shepherd ( John 10:1-16 ) has all the essential features of a parable. (See List of Parables in Appendix.)  </p>
Paradise	<p>a Persian word (pardes), properly meaning a "pleasure-ground" or "park" or "king's garden." (See EDEN .) It came in course of time to be used as a name for the world of happiness and rest hereafter ( Luke 23:43 ;  2 co  12:4 ;  Revelation 2:7 ). For "garden" in  Genesis 2:8  the LXX. has "paradise."  </p>
Parah	<p>the heifer, a town in Benjamin ( Joshua 18:23 ), supposed to be identical with the ruins called Far'ah, about 6 miles north-east of Jerusalem, in the Wady Far'ah, which is a branch of the Wady Kelt.  </p>
Paran	<p>abounding in foliage, or abounding in caverns, ( Genesis 21:21 ), a desert tract forming the north-eastern division of the peninsula of Sinai, lying between the 'Arabah on the east and the wilderness of Shur on the west. It is intersected in a north-western direction by the Wady el-'Arish. It bears the modern name of Badiet et-Tih, i.e., "the desert of the wanderings." This district, through which the children of Israel wandered, lay three days' march from Sinai ( Numbers 10:12 Numbers 10:33 ). From Kadesh, in this wilderness, spies (q.v.) were sent to spy the land ( Numbers 13:3 Numbers 13:26 ). Here, long afterwards, David found refuge from Saul ( 1 Samuel 25:1 1 Samuel 25:4 ).  </p>
Paran, Mount	<p>probably the hilly region or upland wilderness on the north of the desert of Paran forming the southern boundary of the Promised Land ( Deuteronomy 33:2 ;  Habakkuk 3:3 ).  </p>
Parbar	<p>( 1 Chronicles 26:18 ), a place apparently connected with the temple, probably a "suburb" (q.v.), as the word is rendered in  2 Kings 23:11 ; a space between the temple wall and the wall of the court; an open portico into which the chambers of the official persons opened ( 1 Chronicles 26:18 ).  </p>
Parched ground	<p>( Isaiah 35:7 ), Heb. sharab, a "mirage", a phenomenon caused by the refraction of the rays of the sun on the glowing sands of the desert, causing them suddenly to assume the appearance of a beautiful lake. It is called by the modern Arabs by the same Hebrew name <i> serab</i> . </p>
Parchment	<p>a skin prepared for writing on; so called from Pergamos (q.v.), where this was first done ( 2 Timothy 4:13 ).  </p>
Pardon	<p>the forgiveness of sins granted freely ( Isaiah 43:25 ), readily ( Nehemiah 9:17 ;  Psalms 86:5 ), abundantly ( Isaiah 55:7 ;  Romans 5:20 ). Pardon is an act of a sovereign, in pure sovereignty, granting simply a remission of the penalty due to sin, but securing neither honour nor reward to the pardoned. Justification (q.v.), on the other hand, is the act of a judge, and not of a sovereign, and includes pardon and, at the same time, a title to all the rewards and blessings promised in the covenant of life.  </p>
Parlour	<p>(from the Fr. parler, "to speak") denotes an "audience chamber," but that is not the import of the Hebrew word so rendered. It corresponds to what the Turks call a kiosk, as in  Judges 3:20  (the "summer parlour"), or as in the margin of the Revised Version ("the upper chamber of cooling"), a small room built on the roof of the house, with open windows to catch the breeze, and having a door communicating with the outside by which persons seeking an audience may be admitted. While Eglon was resting in such a parlour, Ehud, under pretence of having a message from God to him, was admitted into his presence, and murderously plunged his dagger into his body (21,22).  </p><p> The "inner parlours" in  1 Chronicles 28:11  were the small rooms or chambers which Solomon built all round two sides and one end of the temple ( 1 Kings 6:5 ), "side chambers;" or they may have been, as some think, the porch and the holy place.  </p><p> In  1 Samuel 9:22  the Revised Version reads "guest chamber," a chamber at the high place specially used for sacrificial feasts.  </p>
Parmashta	<p>strong-fisted, a son of Haman, slain in Shushan ( Esther 9:9 ).  </p>
Parmenas	<p>constant, one of the seven "deacons" ( Acts 6:5 ).  </p>
Parshandatha	<p>an interpreter of the law, the eldest of Haman's sons, slain in Shushan ( Esther 9:7 ).  </p>
Parthians	<p>were present in Jerusalem at Pentecost ( Acts 2:9 ). Parthia lay on the east of Media and south of Hyrcania, which separated it from the Caspian Sea. It corresponded with the western half of the modern Khorasan, and now forms a part of Persia.  </p>
Partridge	<p>(Heb. kore, i.e., "caller"). This bird, unlike our own partridge, is distinguished by "its ringing call-note, which in early morning echoes from cliff to cliff amidst the barrenness of the wilderness of Judea and the glens of the forest of Carmel" hence its Hebrew name. This name occurs only twice in Scripture. </p><p> In  1 Samuel 26:20  "David alludes to the mode of chase practised now, as of old, when the partridge, continuously chased, was at length, when fatigued, knocked down by sticks thrown along the ground." It endeavours to save itself "by running, in preference to flight, unless when suddenly started. It is not an inhabitant of the plain or the corn-field, but of rocky hill-sides" (Tristram's Nat. Hist.).  </p><p> In  Jeremiah 17:11  the prophet is illustrating the fact that riches unlawfully acquired are precarious and short-lived. The exact nature of the illustration cannot be precisely determined. Some interpret the words as meaning that the covetous man will be as surely disappointed as the partridge which gathers in eggs, not of her own laying, and is unable to hatch them; others (Tristram), with more probability, as denoting that the man who enriches himself by unjust means "will as surely be disappointed as the partridge which commences to sit, but is speedily robbed of her hopes of a brood" by her eggs being stolen away from her.  </p><p> The commonest partridge in Palestine is the Caccabis saxatilis, the Greek partridge. The partridge of the wilderness (Ammo-perdix heyi) is a smaller species. Both are essentially mountain and rock birds, thus differing from the English partridge, which loves cultivated fields. </p>
Paruah	<p>flourishing, the father of Jehoshaphat, appointed to provide monthly supplies for Solomon from the tribe of Issachar ( 1 Kings 4:17 ).  </p>
Parvaim	<p>the name of a country from which Solomon obtained gold for the temple ( 2 Chronicles 3:6 ). Some have identified it with Ophir, but it is uncertain whether it is even the name of a place. It may simply, as some think, denote "Oriental regions."  </p>
Pasach	<p>clearing, one of the sons of Japhlet, of the tribe of Asher ( 1 Chronicles 7:33 ).  </p>
Pas-dammim	<p>the border of blood = Ephes-dammim (q.v.), between Shochoh and Azekah ( 1 Samuel 17:1 ;  1 Chronicles 11:13 ).  </p>
Pashur	<p>release. </p><li> The son of Immer (probably the same as Amariah,  Nehemiah 10:3 ;  12:2 ), the head of one of the priestly courses, was "chief governor [Heb. paqid nagid, meaning "deputy governor"] of the temple" ( Jeremiah 20:1 Jeremiah 20:2 ). At this time the <i> nagid</i> , or "governor," of the temple was Seraiah the high priest ( 1 Chronicles 6:14 ), and Pashur was his <i> paqid</i> , or "deputy." Enraged at the plainness with which Jeremiah uttered his solemn warnings of coming judgements, because of the abounding iniquity of the times, Pashur ordered the temple police to seize him, and after inflicting on him corporal punishment (forty stripes save one,  Deuteronomy 25:3 ; Compare  2 Corinthians 11:24 ), to put him in the stocks in the high gate of Benjamin, where he remained all night. On being set free in the morning, Jeremiah went to Pashur ( Jeremiah 20:3 Jeremiah 20:5 ), and announced to him that God had changed his name to Magor-missabib, i.e., "terror on every side." The punishment that fell upon him was probably remorse, when he saw the ruin he had brought upon his country by advising a close alliance with Egypt in opposition to the counsels of ( Jeremiah 20:4-6 ). He was carried captive to Babylon, and died there.  </li><li> A priest sent by king Zedekiah to Jeremiah to inquire of the Lord ( 1 Chronicles 24:9 ;  Jeremiah 21:1 ;  38:1-6 ). He advised that the prophet should be put to death.  </li><li> The father of Gedaliah. He was probably the same as (1).   </li>
Passage	<p>denotes in  Joshua 22:11 , as is generally understood, the place where the children of Israel passed over Jordan. The words "the passage of" are, however, more correctly rendered "by the side of," or "at the other side of," thus designating the position of the great altar erected by the eastern tribes on their return home. This word also designates the fords of the Jordan to the south of the Sea of Galilee ( Judges 12:5 Judges 12:6 ), and a pass or rocky defile ( 1 Samuel 13:23 ;  14:4 ). "Passages" in  Jeremiah 22:20  is in the Revised Version more correctly "Abarim" (q.v.), a proper name.  </p>
Passion	<p>Only once found, in  Acts 1:3 , meaning suffering, referring to the sufferings of our Lord.  </p>
Passover	<p>the name given to the chief of the three great historical annual festivals of the Jews. It was kept in remembrance of the Lord's passing over the houses of the Israelites ( Exodus 12:13 ) when the first born of all the Egyptians were destroyed. It is called also the "feast of unleavened bread" ( Exodus 23:15 ;  Mark 14:1 ;  Acts 12:3 ), because during its celebration no leavened bread was to be eaten or even kept in the household ( Exodus 12:15 ). The word afterwards came to denote the lamb that was slain at the feast ( Mark 14:12-14 ;  1 Corinthians 5:7 ).  </p><p> A detailed account of the institution of this feast is given in  Exodus 12  and 13. It was afterwards incorporated in the ceremonial law ( Leviticus 23:4-8 ) as one of the great festivals of the nation. In after times many changes seem to have taken place as to the mode of its celebration as compared with its first celebration (Compare  Deuteronomy 16:2 Deuteronomy 16:5 Deuteronomy 16:6 ;  2 Chr  30:16 ;  Leviticus 23:10-14 ;  Numbers 9:10 Numbers 9:11 ;  28:16-24 ). Again, the use of wine ( Luke 22:17 Luke 22:20 ), of sauce with the bitter herbs ( John 13:26 ), and the service of praise were introduced.  </p><p> There is recorded only one celebration of this feast between the Exodus and the entrance into Canaan, namely, that mentioned in  Numbers 9:5 . (See JOSIAH .) It was primarily a commemorative ordinance, reminding the children of Israel of their deliverance out of Egypt; but it was, no doubt, also a type of the great deliverance wrought by the Messiah for all his people from the doom of death on account of sin, and from the bondage of sin itself, a worse than Egyptian bondage ( 1 Corinthians 5:7 ;  John 1:29 ;  19:32-36 ;  1 Peter 1:19 ;  Galatians 4:4 Galatians 4:5 ). The appearance of Jerusalem on the occasion of the Passover in the time of our Lord is thus fittingly described: "The city itself and the neighbourhood became more and more crowded as the feast approached, the narrow streets and dark arched bazaars showing the same throng of men of all nations as when Jesus had first visited Jerusalem as a boy. Even the temple offered a strange sight at this season, for in parts of the outer courts a wide space was covered with pens for sheep, goats, and cattle to be used for offerings. Sellers shouted the merits of their beasts, sheep bleated, oxen lowed. Sellers of doves also had a place set apart for them. Potters offered a choice from huge stacks of clay dishes and ovens for roasting and eating the Passover lamb. Booths for wine, oil, salt, and all else needed for sacrifices invited customers. Persons going to and from the city shortened their journey by crossing the temple grounds, often carrying burdens...Stalls to change foreign money into the shekel of the temple, which alone could be paid to the priests, were numerous, the whole confusion making the sanctuary like a noisy market" (Geikie's Life of Christ).  </p>
Patara	<p>a city on the south-west coast of Lycia at which Paul landed on his return from his third missionary journey ( Acts 21:1 Acts 21:2 ). Here he found a larger vessel, which was about to sail across the open sea to the coast of Phoenicia. In this vessel he set forth, and reached the city of Tyre in perhaps two or three days.  </p>
Pathros	<p>the name generally given to Upper Egypt (the Thebaid of the Greeks), as distinguished from Matsor, or Lower Egypt ( Isaiah 11:11 ;  Jeremiah 44:1 Jeremiah 44:15 ;  Ezekiel 30:14 ), the two forming Mizraim. After the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, colonies of Jews settled "in the country of Pathros" and other parts of Egypt.  </p>
Patmos	<p>a small rocky and barren island, one of the group called the "Sporades," in the AEgean Sea. It is mentioned in Scripture only in  Revelation 1:9 . It was on this island, to which John was banished by the emperor Domitian (A.D. 95), that he received from God the wondrous revelation recorded in his book. This has naturally invested it with the deepest interest for all time. It is now called Patmo. (See JOHN .) </p>
Patriarch	<p>a name employed in the New Testament with reference to Abraham ( Hebrews 7:4 ), the sons of Jacob ( Acts 7:8 Acts 7:9 ), and to David ( 2:29 ). This name is generally applied to the progenitors of families or "heads of the fathers" ( Joshua 14:1 ) mentioned in Scripture, and they are spoken of as antediluvian (from Adam to Noah) and post-diluvian (from Noah to Jacob) patriachs. But the expression "the patriarch," by way of eminence, is applied to the twelve sons of Jacob, or to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  </p><p> "Patriachal longevity presents itself as one of the most striking of the facts concerning mankind which the early history of the Book of Genesis places before us...There is a large amount of consentient tradition to the effect that the life of man was originally far more prolonged than it is at present, extending to at least several hundred years. The Babylonians, Egyptians, and Chinese exaggerated these hundreds into thousands. The Greeks and Romans, with more moderation, limited human life within a thousand or eight hundred years. The Hindus still farther shortened the term. Their books taught that in the first age of the world man was free from diseases, and lived ordinarily four hundred years; in the second age the term of life was reduced from four hundred to three hundred; in the third it became two hundred; in the fourth and last it was brought down to one hundred" (Rawlinson's Historical Illustrations). </p>
Patrobas	<p>a Christian at Rome to whom Paul sent salutations ( Romans 16:14 ).  </p>
Pau	<p>( Genesis 36:39 ) or Pai ( 1 Chronicles 1:50 ), bleating, an Edomitish city ruled over by Hadar.  </p>
Paul	<p>=Saul (q.v.) was born about the same time as our Lord. His circumcision-name was Saul, and probably the name Paul was also given to him in infancy "for use in the Gentile world," as "Saul" would be his Hebrew home-name. He was a native of Tarsus, the capital of Cilicia, a Roman province in the south-east of Asia Minor. That city stood on the banks of the river Cydnus, which was navigable thus far; hence it became a centre of extensive commercial traffic with many countries along the shores of the Mediterranean, as well as with the countries of central Asia Minor. It thus became a city distinguished for the wealth of its inhabitants. </p><p> Tarsus was also the seat of a famous university, higher in reputation even than the universities of Athens and Alexandria, the only others that then existed. Here Saul was born, and here he spent his youth, doubtless enjoying the best education his native city could afford. His father was of the straitest sect of the Jews, a Pharisee, of the tribe of Benjamin, of pure and unmixed Jewish blood ( Acts 23:6 ; Phil  3:5 ). We learn nothing regarding his mother; but there is reason to conclude that she was a pious woman, and that, like-minded with her husband, she exercised all a mother influence in moulding the character of her son, so that he could afterwards speak of himself as being, from his youth up, "touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless" (Phil  3:6 ).  </p><p> We read of his sister and his sister's son ( Acts 23:16 ), and of other relatives ( Romans 16:7 Romans 16:11 Romans 16:12 ). Though a Jew, his father was a Roman citizen. How he obtained this privilege we are not informed. "It might be bought, or won by distinguished service to the state, or acquired in several other ways; at all events, his son was freeborn. It was a valuable privilege, and one that was to prove of great use to Paul, although not in the way in which his father might have been expected to desire him to make use of it." Perhaps the most natural career for the youth to follow was that of a merchant. "But it was decided that...he should go to college and become a rabbi, that is, a minister, a teacher, and a lawyer all in one."  </p><p> According to Jewish custom, however, he learned a trade before entering on the more direct preparation for the sacred profession. The trade he acquired was the making of tents from goats' hair cloth, a trade which was one of the commonest in Tarsus. </p><p> His preliminary education having been completed, Saul was sent, when about thirteen years of age probably, to the great Jewish school of sacred learning at Jerusalem as a student of the law. Here he became a pupil of the celebrated rabbi Gamaliel, and here he spent many years in an elaborate study of the Scriptures and of the many questions concerning them with which the rabbis exercised themselves. During these years of diligent study he lived "in all good conscience," unstained by the vices of that great city. </p><p> After the period of his student-life expired, he probably left Jerusalem for Tarsus, where he may have been engaged in connection with some synagogue for some years. But we find him back again at Jerusalem very soon after the death of our Lord. Here he now learned the particulars regarding the crucifixion, and the rise of the new sect of the "Nazarenes." </p><p> For some two years after Pentecost, Christianity was quietly spreading its influence in Jerusalem. At length Stephen, one of the seven deacons, gave forth more public and aggressive testimony that Jesus was the Messiah, and this led to much excitement among the Jews and much disputation in their synagogues. Persecution arose against Stephen and the followers of Christ generally, in which Saul of Tarsus took a prominent part. He was at this time probably a member of the great Sanhedrin, and became the active leader in the furious persecution by which the rulers then sought to exterminate Christianity. </p><p> But the object of this persecution also failed. "They that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word." The anger of the persecutor was thereby kindled into a fiercer flame. Hearing that fugitives had taken refuge in Damascus, he obtained from the chief priest letters authorizing him to proceed thither on his persecuting career. This was a long journey of about 130 miles, which would occupy perhaps six days, during which, with his few attendants, he steadily went onward, "breathing out threatenings and slaughter." But the crisis of his life was at hand. He had reached the last stage of his journey, and was within sight of Damascus. As he and his companions rode on, suddenly at mid-day a brilliant light shone round them, and Saul was laid prostrate in terror on the ground, a voice sounding in his ears, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" The risen Saviour was there, clothed in the vesture of his glorified humanity. In answer to the anxious inquiry of the stricken persecutor, "Who art thou, Lord?" he said, "I am Jesus whom thou persecutest" ( Acts 9:5 ;  22:8 ;  26:15 ).  </p><p> This was the moment of his conversion, the most solemn in all his life. Blinded by the dazzling light ( Acts 9:8 ), his companions led him into the city, where, absorbed in deep thought for three days, he neither ate nor drank ( 9:11 ). Ananias, a disciple living in Damascus, was informed by a vision of the change that had happened to Saul, and was sent to him to open his eyes and admit him by baptism into the Christian church ( 9:11-16 ). The whole purpose of his life was now permanently changed.  </p><p> Immediately after his conversion he retired into the solitudes of Arabia ( Galatians 1:17 ), perhaps of "Sinai in Arabia," for the purpose, probably, of devout study and meditation on the marvellous revelation that had been made to him. "A veil of thick darkness hangs over this visit to Arabia. Of the scenes among which he moved, of the thoughts and occupations which engaged him while there, of all the circumstances of a crisis which must have shaped the whole tenor of his after-life, absolutely nothing is known. 'Immediately,' says St. Paul, 'I went away into Arabia.' The historian passes over the incident [Compare  Acts 9:23  and  1 Kings 11:38 1 Kings 11:39 ]. It is a mysterious pause, a moment of suspense, in the apostle's history, a breathless calm, which ushers in the tumultuous storm of his active missionary life." Coming back, after three years, to Damascus, he began to preach the gospel "boldly in the name of Jesus" ( Acts 9:27 ), but was soon obliged to flee ( 9:25 ;  2 co.  11:33 ) from the Jews and betake himself to Jerusalem. Here he tarried for three weeks, but was again forced to flee ( Acts 9:28 Acts 9:29 ) from persecution. He now returned to his native Tarsus ( Galatians 1:21 ), where, for probably about three years, we lose sight of him. The time had not yet come for his entering on his great life-work of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles.  </p><p> At length the city of Antioch, the capital of Syria, became the scene of great Christian activity. There the gospel gained a firm footing, and the cause of Christ prospered. Barnabas (q.v.), who had been sent from Jerusalem to superintend the work at Antioch, found it too much for him, and remembering Saul, he set out to Tarsus to seek for him. He readily responded to the call thus addressed to him, and came down to Antioch, which for "a whole year" became the scene of his labours, which were crowned with great success. The disciples now, for the first time, were called "Christians" ( Acts 11:26 ).  </p><p> The church at Antioch now proposed to send out missionaries to the Gentiles, and Saul and Barnabas, with John Mark as their attendant, were chosen for this work. This was a great epoch in the history of the church. Now the disciples began to give effect to the Master's command: "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature." </p><p> The three missionaries went forth on the first missionary tour. They sailed from Seleucia, the seaport of Antioch, across to Cyprus, some 80 miles to the south-west. Here at Paphos, Sergius Paulus, the Roman proconsul, was converted, and now Saul took the lead, and was ever afterwards called Paul. The missionaries now crossed to the mainland, and then proceeded 6 or 7 miles up the river Cestrus to Perga ( Acts 13:13 ), where John Mark deserted the work and returned to Jerusalem. The two then proceeded about 100 miles inland, passing through Pamphylia, Pisidia, and Lycaonia. The towns mentioned in this tour are the Pisidian Antioch, where Paul delivered his first address of which we have any record ( 13:16-51 ; comp  10:30-43 ), Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe. They returned by the same route to see and encourage the converts they had made, and ordain elders in every city to watch over the churches which had been gathered. From Perga they sailed direct for Antioch, from which they had set out.  </p><p> After remaining "a long time", probably till A.D. 50 or 51, in Antioch, a great controversy broke out in the church there regarding the relation of the Gentiles to the Mosaic law. For the purpose of obtaining a settlement of this question, Paul and Barnabas were sent as deputies to consult the church at Jerusalem. The council or synod which was there held ( Acts 15 ) decided against the Judaizing party; and the deputies, accompanied by Judas and Silas, returned to Antioch, bringing with them the decree of the council.  </p><p> After a short rest at Antioch, Paul said to Barnabas: "Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do." Mark proposed again to accompany them; but Paul refused to allow him to go. Barnabas was resolved to take Mark, and thus he and Paul had a sharp contention. They separated, and never again met. Paul, however, afterwards speaks with honour of Barnabas, and sends for Mark to come to him at Rome ( Colossians 4:10 ;  2 Tim  4:11 ).  </p><p> Paul took with him Silas, instead of Barnabas, and began his second missionary journey about A.D. 51. This time he went by land, revisiting the churches he had already founded in Asia. But he longed to enter into "regions beyond," and still went forward through Phrygia and Galatia ( 16:6 ). Contrary to his intention, he was constrained to linger in Galatia (q.v.), on account of some bodily affliction ( Galatians 4:13 Galatians 4:14 ). Bithynia, a populous province on the shore of the Black Sea, lay now before him, and he wished to enter it; but the way was shut, the Spirit in some manner guiding him in another direction, till he came down to the shores of the AEgean and arrived at Troas, on the north-western coast of Asia Minor ( Acts 16:8 ). Of this long journey from Antioch to Troas we have no account except some references to it in his Epistle to the ( Galatians 4:13 ).  </p><p> As he waited at Troas for indications of the will of God as to his future movements, he saw, in the vision of the night, a man from the opposite shores of Macedonia standing before him, and heard him cry, "Come over, and help us" ( Acts 16:9 ). Paul recognized in this vision a message from the Lord, and the very next day set sail across the Hellespont, which separated him from Europe, and carried the tidings of the gospel into the Western world. In Macedonia, churches were planted in Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea. Leaving this province, Paul passed into Achaia, "the paradise of genius and renown." He reached Athens, but quitted it after, probably, a brief sojourn ( 17:17-31 ). The Athenians had received him with cold disdain, and he never visited that city again. He passed over to Corinth, the seat of the Roman government of Achaia, and remained there a year and a half, labouring with much success. While at Corinth, he wrote his two epistles to the church of Thessalonica, his earliest apostolic letters, and then sailed for Syria, that he might be in time to keep the feast of Pentecost at Jerusalem. He was accompanied by Aquila and Priscilla, whom he left at Ephesus, at which he touched, after a voyage of thirteen or fifteen days. He landed at Caesarea, and went up to Jerusalem, and having "saluted the church" there, and kept the feast, he left for Antioch, where he abode "some time" ( Acts 18:20-23 ).  </p><p> He then began his third missionary tour. He journeyed by land in the "upper coasts" (the more eastern parts) of Asia Minor, and at length made his way to Ephesus, where he tarried for no less than three years, engaged in ceaseless Christian labour. "This city was at the time the Liverpool of the Mediterranean. It possessed a splendid harbour, in which was concentrated the traffic of the sea which was then the highway of the nations; and as Liverpool has behind her the great towns of Lancashire, so had Ephesus behind and around her such cities as those mentioned along with her in the epistles to the churches in the book of Revelation, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea. It was a city of vast wealth, and it was given over to every kind of pleasure, the fame of its theatres and race-course being world-wide" (Stalker's Life of St. Paul). Here a "great door and effectual" was opened to the apostle. His fellow-labourers aided him in his work, carrying the gospel to Colosse and Laodicea and other places which they could reach. </p><p> Very shortly before his departure from Ephesus, the apostle wrote his First Epistle to the Corinthians (q.v.). The silversmiths, whose traffic in the little images which they made was in danger (see DEMETRIUS), organized a riot against Paul, and he left the city, and proceeded to Troas ( 2 Corinthians 2:12 ), whence after some time he went to meet Titus in Macedonia. Here, in consequence of the report Titus brought from Corinth, he wrote his second epistle to that church. Having spent probably most of the summer and autumn in Macedonia, visiting the churches there, specially the churches of Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea, probably penetrating into the interior, to the shores of the Adriatic ( Romans 15:19 ), he then came into Greece, where he abode three month, spending probably the greater part of this time in Corinth ( Acts 20:2 ). During his stay in this city he wrote his Epistle to the Galatians, and also the great Epistle to the Romans. At the end of the three months he left Achaia for Macedonia, thence crossed into Asia Minor, and touching at Miletus, there addressed the Ephesian presbyters, whom he had sent for to meet him ( Acts 20:17 ), and then sailed for Tyre, finally reaching Jerusalem, probably in the spring of A.D. 58.  </p><p> While at Jerusalem, at the feast of Pentecost, he was almost murdered by a Jewish mob in the temple. (See TEMPLE, HEROD'S.) Rescued from their violence by the Roman commandant, he was conveyed as a prisoner to Caesarea, where, from various causes, he was detained a prisoner for two years in Herod's praetorium ( Acts 23:35 ). "Paul was not kept in close confinement; he had at least the range of the barracks in which he was detained. There we can imagine him pacing the ramparts on the edge of the Mediterranean, and gazing wistfully across the blue waters in the direction of Macedonia, Achaia, and Ephesus, where his spiritual children were pining for him, or perhaps encountering dangers in which they sorely needed his presence. It was a mysterious providence which thus arrested his energies and condemned the ardent worker to inactivity; yet we can now see the reason for it. Paul was needing rest. After twenty years of incessant evangelization, he required leisure to garner the harvest of experience...During these two years he wrote nothing; it was a time of internal mental activity and silent progress" (Stalker's Life of St. Paul).  </p><p> At the end of these two years Felix (q.v.) was succeeded in the governorship of Palestine by Porcius Festus, before whom the apostle was again heard. But judging it right at this crisis to claim the privilege of a Roman citizen, he appealed to the emperor ( Acts 25:11 ). Such an appeal could not be disregarded, and Paul was at once sent on to Rome under the charge of one Julius, a centurion of the "Augustan cohort." After a long and perilous voyage, he at length reached the imperial city in the early spring, probably, of A.D. 61. Here he was permitted to occupy his own hired house, under constant military custody. This privilege was accorded to him, no doubt, because he was a Roman citizen, and as such could not be put into prison without a trial. The soldiers who kept guard over Paul were of course changed at frequent intervals, and thus he had the opportunity of preaching the gospel to many of them during these "two whole years," and with the blessed result of spreading among the imperial guards, and even in Caesar's household, an interest in the truth (Phil  1:13 ). His rooms were resorted to by many anxious inquirers, both Jews and Gentiles ( Acts 28:23 Acts 28:30 Acts 28:31 ), and thus his imprisonment "turned rather to the furtherance of the gospel," and his "hired house" became the centre of a gracious influence which spread over the whole city. According to a Jewish tradition, it was situated on the borders of the modern Ghetto, which has been the Jewish quarters in Rome from the time of Pompey to the present day. During this period the apostle wrote his epistles to the Colossians, Ephesians, Philippians, and to Philemon, and probably also to the Hebrews.  </p><p> This first imprisonment came at length to a close, Paul having been acquitted, probably because no witnesses appeared against him. Once more he set out on his missionary labours, probably visiting western and eastern Europe and Asia Minor. During this period of freedom he wrote his First Epistle to Timothy and his Epistle to Titus. The year of his release was signalized by the burning of Rome, which Nero saw fit to attribute to the Christians. A fierce persecution now broke out against the Christians. Paul was siezed, and once more conveyed to Rome a prisoner. During this imprisonment he probably wrote the Second Epistle to Timothy, the last he ever wrote. "There can be little doubt that he appered again at Nero's bar, and this time the charge did not break down. In all history there is not a more startling illustration of the irony of human life than this scene of Paul at the bar of Nero. On the judgment-seat, clad in the imperial purple, sat a man who, in a bad world, had attained the eminence of being the very worst and meanest being in it, a man stained with every crime, a man whose whole being was so steeped in every nameable and unnameable vice, that body and soul of him were, as some one said at the time, nothing but a compound of mud and blood; and in the prisoner's dock stood the best man the world possessed, his hair whitened with labours for the good of men and the glory of God. The trial ended: Paul was condemned, and delivered over to the executioner. He was led out of the city, with a crowd of the lowest rabble at his heels. The fatal spot was reached; he knelt beside the block; the headsman's axe gleamed in the sun and fell; and the head of the apostle of the world rolled down in the dust" (probably A.D. 66), four years before the fall of Jerusalem.  </p>
Pavement	<p>It was the custom of the Roman governors to erect their tribunals in open places, as the market-place, the circus, or even the highway. Pilate caused his seat of judgment to be set down in a place called "the Pavement" ( John 19:13 ) i.e., a place paved with a mosaic of coloured stones. It was probably a place thus prepared in front of the "judgment hall." (See GABBATHA .) </p>
Pavilion	<p>a tent or tabernacle ( 2 Samuel 22:12 ;  1 Kings 20:12-16 ), or enclosure ( Psalms 18:11 ;  27:5 ). In  Jeremiah 43:10  it probably denotes the canopy suspended over the judgement-seat of the king.  </p>
Peace offerings	<p>(Heb. shelamim), detailed regulations regarding given in  Leviticus 3 ;  Leviticus 7:11-21 Leviticus 7:29-34 . They were of three kinds, (1) eucharistic or thanksgiving offerings, expressive of gratitude for blessings received; (2) in fulfilment of a vow, but expressive also of thanks for benefits recieved; and (3) free-will offerings, something spontaneously devoted to God.  </p>
Peacock	<p>(Heb. tuk, apparently borrowed from the Tamil tokei). This bird is indigenous to India. It was brought to Solomon by his ships from Tarshish ( 1 Kings 10:22 ;  2 Chr  9:21 ), which in this case was probably a district on the Malabar coast of India, or in Ceylon. The word so rendered in  Job 39:13  literally means wild, tumultuous crying, and properly denotes the female ostrich (q.v.).  </p>
Pearl	<p>(Heb. gabish,  Job 28:18 ; Gr. margarites,  Matthew 7:6 ;  13:46 ;  Revelation 21:21 ). The pearl oyster is found in the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea. Its shell is the "mother of pearl," which is of great value for ornamental purposes ( 1 Timothy 2:9 ;  Revelation 17:4 ). Each shell contains eight or ten pearls of various sizes.  </p>
Peculiar	<p>as used in the phrase "peculiar people" in  1 Peter 2:9 , is derived from the Lat. peculium, and denotes, as rendered in the Revised Version ("a people for God's own possession"), a special possession or property. The church is the "property" of God, his "purchased possession" ( Ephesians 1:14 ; RSV, "God's own possession").  </p>
Pedahel	<p>redeemed of God, the son of Ammihud, a prince of Naphtali ( Numbers 34:28 ).  </p>
Pedahzur	<p>rock of redemption, the father of Gamaliel and prince of Manasseh at the time of the Exodus ( Numbers 1:10 ;  2:20 ).  </p>
Pedaiah	<p>redemption of the Lord. </p><li> The father of Zebudah, who was the wife of Josiah and mother of king Jehoiakim ( 2 Kings 23:36 ).  </li><li> The father of Zerubbabel ( 1 Chronicles 3:17-19 ).  </li><li>. The father of Joel, ruler of the half-tribe of Manasseh ( 1 Chronicles 27:20 ).  </li><li> Nehemiah 3:25 .  </li><li> A Levite ( 8:4 ).  </li><li> A Benjamite ( 11:7 ).  </li><li> A Levite ( 13:13 ).   </li>
Pekah	<p>open-eyed, the son of Remaliah a captain in the army of Pekahiah, king of Israel, whom he slew, with the aid of a band of Gileadites, and succeeded (B.C. 758) on the throne ( 2 Kings 15:25 ). Seventeen years after this he entered into an alliance with Rezin, king of Syria, and took part with him in besieging Jerusalem ( 2 Kings 15:37 ;  16:5 ). But Tiglath-pilser, who was in alliance with Ahaz, king of Judah, came up against Pekah, and carried away captive many of the inhabitants of his kingdom ( 2 Kings 15:29 ). This was the beginning of the "Captivity." Soon after this Pekah was put to death by Hoshea, the son of Elah, who usurped the throne ( 2 Kings 15:30 ;  16:1-9 . Compare  Isaiah 7:16 ;  8:4 ;  9:12 ). He is supposed by some to have been the "shephard" mentioned in  Zechariah 11:16 .  </p>
Pekahiah	<p>the Lord opened his eyes, the son and successor of Menahem on the throne of Israel. He was murdered in the royal palace of Samaria by Pekah, one of the captains of his army ( 2 Kings 15:23-26 ), after a reign of two years (B.C. 761-759). He "did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord."  </p>
Pekod	<p>probably a place in Babylonia ( Jeremiah 50:21 ;  Ezekiel 23:23 ). It is the opinion, however, of some that this word signifies "visitation," "punishment," and allegorically "designates Babylon as the city which was to be destroyed."  </p>
Pelaiah	<p>distinguished of the Lord. </p><li> One of David's posterity ( 1 Chronicles 3:24 ).  </li><li> A Levite who expounded the law ( Nehemiah 8:7 ).   </li>
Pelatiah	<p>deliverance of the Lord. </p><li> A son of Hananiah and grandson of Zerubbabel ( 1 Chronicles 3:21 ).  </li><li> A captain of "the sons of Simeon" ( 4:42 ).  </li><li> Nehemiah 10:22 .  </li><li> One of the twenty-five princes of the people against whom Ezekiel prophesied on account of their wicked counsel (Ezek.  11:1-13 ).   </li>
Peleg	<p>division, one of the sons of Eber; so called because "in his days was the earth divided" ( Genesis 10:25 ). Possibly he may have lived at the time of the dispersion from Babel. But more probably the reference is to the dispersion of the two races which sprang from Eber, the one spreading towards Mesopotamia and Syria, and the other southward into Arabia.  </p>
Pelet	<p>deliverance. </p><li> A descendant of Judah ( 1 Chronicles 2:47 ).  </li><li> A Benjamite who joined David at Ziklag ( 1 Chronicles 12:3 ).   </li>
Peleth	<p>swiftness. </p><li> A Reubenite whose son was one of the conspirators against Moses and Aaron ( Numbers 16:1 ).  </li><li> One of the sons of Jonathan ( 1 Chronicles 2:33 ).   </li>
Pelethites	<p>mentioned always along with the Cherethites, and only in the time of David. The word probably means "runners" or "couriers," and may denote that while forming part of David's bodyguard, they were also sometimes employed as couriers ( 2 Samuel 8:18 ; ( <span class="badLink">2 Samuel 1:38</span> <span class="badLink">2 Samuel 1:44</span> ;  1 Chronicles 18:17 ). Some, however, think that these are the names simply of two Philistine tribes from which David selected his body-guard. They are mentioned along with the Gittites ( 2 Samuel 15:18 ), another body of foreign troops whom David gathered round him.  </p>
Pelicans	<p>are frequently met with at the waters of Merom and the Sea of Galilee. The pelican is ranked among unclean birds ( Leviticus 11:18 ;  Deuteronomy 14:17 ). It is of an enormous size, being about 6 feet long, with wings stretching out over 12 feet. The Hebrew name (kaath, i.e., "vomiter") of this bird is incorrectly rendered "cormorant" in the Authorized Version of  Isaiah 34:11  and  Zephaniah 2:14 , but correctly in the Revised Version. It receives its Hebrew name from its habit of storing in its pouch large quantities of fish, which it disgorges when it feeds its young. Two species are found on the Syrian coast, the Pelicanus onocrotalus, or white pelican, and the Pelicanus crispus, or Dalmatian pelican.  </p>
Penny	<p>(Gr. denarion), a silver coin of the value of about 7 1/2d. or 8d. of our present money. It is thus rendered in the New Testament, and is more frequently mentioned than any other coin ( Matthew 18:28 ;  Matthew 20:2 Matthew 20:9 Matthew 20:13 ;  Mark 6:37 ;  14:5 , etc.). It was the daily pay of a Roman soldier in the time of Christ. In the reign of Edward III. an English penny was a labourer's day's wages. This was the "tribute money" with reference to which our Lord said, "Whose image and superscription is this?" When they answered, "Caesar's," he replied, "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and to God the things that are God's" ( Matthew 22:19 ;  Mark 12:15 ).  </p>
Pentateuch	<p>the five-fold volume, consisting of the first five books of the Old Testament. This word does not occur in Scripture, nor is it certainly known when the roll was thus divided into five portions Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy. Probably that was done by the LXX. translators. Some modern critics speak of a Hexateuch, introducing the Book of Joshua as one of the group. But this book is of an entirely different character from the other books, and has a different author. It stands by itself as the first of a series of historical books beginning with the entrance of the Israelites into Canaan. (See JOSHUA .) </p><p> The books composing the Pentateuch are properly but one book, the "Law of Moses," the "Book of the Law of Moses," the "Book of Moses," or, as the Jews designate it, the "Torah" or "Law." That in its present form it "proceeds from a single author is proved by its plan and aim, according to which its whole contents refer to the covenant concluded between Jehovah and his people, by the instrumentality of Moses, in such a way that everything before his time is perceived to be preparatory to this fact, and all the rest to be the development of it. Nevertheless, this unity has not been stamped upon it as a matter of necessity by the latest redactor: it has been there from the beginning, and is visible in the first plan and in the whole execution of the work.", Keil, Einl. i.d. A. T. </p><p> A certain school of critics have set themselves to reconstruct the books of the Old Testament. By a process of "scientific study" they have discovered that the so-called historical books of the Old Testament are not history at all, but a miscellaneous collection of stories, the inventions of many different writers, patched together by a variety of editors! As regards the Pentateuch, they are not ashamed to attribute fraud, and even conspiracy, to its authors, who sought to find acceptance to their work which was composed partly in the age of Josiah, and partly in that of Ezra and Nehemiah, by giving it out to be the work of Moses! This is not the place to enter into the details of this controversy. We may say frankly, however, that we have no faith in this "higher criticism." It degrades the books of the Old Testament below the level of fallible human writings, and the arguments on which its speculations are built are altogether untenable. </p><p> The evidences in favour of the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch are conclusive. We may thus state some of them briefly: </p><li> These books profess to have been written by Moses in the name of God ( Exodus 17:14 ;  Exodus 24:3 Exodus 24:4 Exodus 24:7 ;  Exodus 32:7-10 Exodus 32:30-34 ;  34:27 ;  Leviticus 26:46 ;  27:34 ;  Deuteronomy 31:9 Deuteronomy 31:24 Deuteronomy 31:25 ).  </li><li> This also is the uniform and persistent testimony of the Jews of all sects in all ages and countries (Compare  Joshua 8:31 Joshua 8:32 ;  1 Kings 2:3 ;  Jeremiah 7:22 ;  Ezra 6:18 ;  Nehemiah 8:1 ;  Malachi 4:4 ;  Matthew 22:24 ;  Acts 15:21 ).  </li><li> Our Lord plainly taught the Mosaic authorship of these books ( Matthew 5:17 Matthew 5:18 ;  19:8 ;  Matthew 22:31 Matthew 22:32 ;  23:2 ;  Mark 10:9 ;  12:26 ;  Luke 16:31 ;  20:37 ;  Luke 24:26 Luke 24:27 Luke 24:44 ;  John 3:14 ;  John 5:45 John 5:46 John 5:47 ;  John 6:32 John 6:49 ;  John 7:19 John 7:22 ). In the face of this fact, will any one venture to allege either that Christ was ignorant of the composition of the Bible, or that, knowing the true state of the case, he yet encouraged the people in the delusion they clung to?  </li><li> From the time of Joshua down to the time of Ezra there is, in the intermediate historical books, a constant reference to the Pentateuch as the "Book of the Law of Moses." This is a point of much importance, inasmuch as the critics deny that there is any such reference; and hence they deny the historical character of the Pentateuch. As regards the Passover, e.g., we find it frequently spoken of or alluded to in the historical books following the Pentateuch, showing that the "Law of Moses" was then certainly known. It was celebrated in the time of Joshua ( Joshua 5:10 , cf  4:19 ), Hezekiah ( 2 Chronicles 30 ), Josiah ( 2 Kings 23 ;  2 Chr.  <span class="badLink">35</span> ), and Zerubbabel ( Ezra 6:19-22 ), and is referred to in such passages as  2 Kings 23:22 ;  2 Chr  <span class="badLink">35:18</span> ;  1 Kings 9:25  ("three times in a year");  2 Chronicles 8:13 . Similarly we might show frequent references to the Feast of Tabernacles and other Jewish institutions, although we do not admit that any valid argument can be drawn from the silence of Scripture in such a case. An examination of the following texts,  1 Kings 2:9 ;  2 Kings  14:6 ;  2 Chr  23:18 ;  25:4 ;  34:14 ;  Ezra 3:2 ;  7:6 ;  Daniel 9:11 Daniel 9:13 , will also plainly show that the "Law of Moses" was known during all these centuries.  <p> Granting that in the time of Moses there existed certain oral traditions or written records and documents which he was divinely led to make use of in his history, and that his writing was revised by inspired successors, this will fully account for certain peculiarities of expression which critics have called "anachronisms" and "contradictions," but in no way militates against the doctrine that Moses was the original author of the whole of the Pentateuch. It is not necessary for us to affirm that the whole is an original composition; but we affirm that the evidences clearly demonstrate that Moses was the author of those books which have come down to us bearing his name. The Pentateuch is certainly the basis and necessary preliminary of the whole of the Old Testament history and literature. (See DEUTERONOMY .) </p> </li>
Pentecost	<p>i.e., "fiftieth", found only in the New Testament ( Acts 2:1 ;  20:16 ;  1 Corinthians 16:8 ). The festival so named is first spoken of in  Exodus 23:16  as "the feast of harvest," and again in  Exodus 34:22  as "the day of the firstfruits" ( Numbers 28:26 ). From the sixteenth of the month of Nisan (the second day of the Passover), seven complete weeks, i.e., forty-nine days, were to be reckoned, and this feast was held on the fiftieth day. The manner in which it was to be kept is described in  Leviticus 23:15-19 ;  Numbers 28:27-29 . Besides the sacrifices prescribed for the occasion, every one was to bring to the Lord his "tribute of a free-will offering" ( Deuteronomy 16:9-11 ). The purpose of this feast was to commemorate the completion of the grain harvest. Its distinguishing feature was the offering of "two leavened loaves" made from the new corn of the completed harvest, which, with two lambs, were waved before the Lord as a thank offering.  </p><p> The day of Pentecost is noted in the Christian Church as the day on which the Spirit descended upon the apostles, and on which, under Peter's preaching, so many thousands were converted in Jerusalem ( Acts 2 ).  </p>
Penuel	<p>face of God, a place not far from Succoth, on the east of the Jordan and north of the river Jabbok. It is also called "Peniel." Here Jacob wrestled ( Genesis 32:24-32 ) "with a man" ("the angel",  Hosea 12:4 . Jacob says of him, "I have seen God face to face") "till the break of day."  </p><p> A town was afterwards built there ( Judges 8:8 ;  1 Kings 12:25 ). The men of this place refused to succour Gideon and his little army when they were in pursuit of the Midianites ( Judges 8:1-21 ). On his return, Gideon slew the men of this city and razed its lofty watch-tower to the ground.  </p>
Peor	<p>opening. </p><li> A mountain peak ( Numbers 23:28 ) to which Balak led Balaam as a last effort to induce him to pronounce a curse upon Israel. When he looked on the tribes encamped in the acacia groves below him, he could not refrain from giving utterance to a remarkable benediction ( 24:1-9 ). Balak was more than ever enraged at Balaam, and bade him flee for his life. But before he went he gave expression to that wonderful prediction regarding the future of this mysterious people, whose "goodly tents" were spread out before him, and the coming of a "Star" out of Jacob and a "Sceptre" out of Israel ( 24:14-17 ).  </li><li> A Moabite divinity, called also "Baal-peor" ( Numbers 25:3 Numbers 25:5 Numbers 25:18 ; Compare  Deuteronomy 3:29 ).   </li>
Perazim, Mount	<p>mount of breaches, only in  Isaiah 28:21 . It is the same as BAAL-PERAZIM (q.v.), where David gained a victory over the Philistines ( 2 Samuel 5:20 ).  </p>
Peres	<p>divided, one of the mysterious words "written over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall" of king Belshazzar's palace ( Daniel 5:28 ). (See MENE .) </p>
Perez	<p>=Pharez, (q.v.), breach, the son of Judah ( Nehemiah 11:4 ). "The chief of all the captains of the host for the first month" in the reign of David was taken from his family ( 1 Chronicles 27:3 ). Four hundred and sixty-eight of his "sons" came back from captivity with Zerubbabel, who himself was one of them ( 1 Chronicles 9:4 ;  Nehemiah 11:6 ).  </p>
Perez-uzzah	<p>the breach of Uzzah, a place where God "burst forth upon Uzzah, so that he died," when he rashly "took hold" of the ark ( 2 Samuel 6:6-8 ). It was not far from Kirjath-jearim (q.v.).  </p>
Perfection	<p>See SANCTIFICATION . </p>
Perfumes	<p>were used in religious worship, and for personal and domestic enjoyment ( Exodus 30:35-37 ;  Proverbs 7:17 ; Cant  3:6 ;  Isaiah 57:9 ); and also in embalming the dead, and in other funeral ceremonies ( Mark 14:8 ;  Luke 24:1 ;  John 19:39 ).  </p>
Perga	<p>the capital of Pamphylia, on the coast of Asia Minor. Paul and his companions landed at this place from Cyprus on their first missionary journey ( Acts 13:13 Acts 13:14 ), and here Mark forsook the party and returned to Jerusalem. Some time afterwards Paul and Barnabas again visited this city and "preached the word" ( 14:25 ). It stood on the banks of the river Cestrus, some 7 miles from its mouth, and was a place of some commercial importance. It is now a ruin, called Eski Kalessi.  </p>
Pergamos	<p>the chief city of Mysia, in Asia Minor. One of the "seven churches" was planted here ( Revelation 1:11 ;  2:17 ). It was noted for its wickedness, insomuch that our Lord says "Satan's seat" was there. The church of Pergamos was rebuked for swerving from the truth and embracing the doctrines of Balaam and the Nicolaitanes. Antipas, Christ's "faithful martyr," here sealed his testimony with his blood.  </p><p> This city stood on the banks of the river Caicus, about 20 miles from the sea. It is now called Bergama, and has a population of some twenty thousand, of whom about two thousand profess to be Christians. Parchment (q.v.) was first made here, and was called by the Greeks pergamene, from the name of the city.  </p>
Perida	<p>kernel,  Nehemiah 7:57 . (See PERUDA .) </p>
Perizzites	<p>villagers; dwellers in the open country, the Canaanitish nation inhabiting the fertile regions south and south-west of Carmel. "They were the graziers, farmers, and peasants of the time." They were to be driven out of the land by the descendants of Abraham ( Genesis 15:20 ;  Exodus 3:8 Exodus 3:17 ;  23:23 ;  33:2 ;  34:11 ). They are afterwards named among the conquered tribes ( Joshua 24:11 ). Still lingering in the land, however, they were reduced to servitude by Solomon ( 1 Kings 9:20 ).  </p>
Persecution	<p>The first great persecution for religious opinion of which we have any record was that which broke out against the worshippers of God among the Jews in the days of Ahab, when that king, at the instigation of his wife Jezebel, "a woman in whom, with the reckless and licentious habits of an Oriental queen, were united the fiercest and sternest qualities inherent in the old Semitic race", sought in the most relentless manner to extirpate the worship of Jehovah and substitute in its place the worship of Ashtoreth and Baal. Ahab's example in this respect was followed by Manasseh, who "shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another" ( 2 Kings 21:16 ; Compare  24:4 ). In all ages, in one form or another, the people of God have had to suffer persecution. In its earliest history the Christian church passed through many bloody persecutions. Of subsequent centuries in our own and in other lands the same sad record may be made.  </p><p> Christians are forbidden to seek the propagation of the gospel by force ( Matthew 7:1 ;  Luke 9:54-56 ;  Romans 14:4 ;  James 4:11 James 4:12 ). The words of  Psalms 7:13 , "He ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors," ought rather to be, as in the Revised Version, "He maketh his arrows fiery [shafts]."  </p>
Perseverance of the saints	<p>their certain continuance in a state of grace. Once justified and regenerated, the believer can neither totally nor finally fall away from grace, but will certainly persevere therein and attain everlasting life. </p><p> This doctrine is clearly taught in these passages,  John 10:28 John 10:29 ;  Romans 11:29 ; Phil  1:6 ;  1 Peter 1:5 . It, moreover, follows from a consideration of (1) the immutability of the divine decrees ( Jeremiah 31:3 ;  Matthew 24:22-24 ;  Acts 13:48 ;  Romans 8:30 ); (2) the provisions of the covenant of grace ( Jeremiah 32:40 ;  John 10:29 ;  17:2-6 ); (3) the atonement and intercession of Christ ( Isaiah 53:6 Isaiah 53:11 ;  Matthew 20:28 ;  1 Peter 2:24 ;  John 11:42 ;  John 17:11 John 17:15 John 17:20 ;  Romans 8:34 ); and (4) the indwelling of the Holy Ghost ( John 14:16 ;  2 co  John 1:21 John 1:22 ;  5:5 ;  Ephesians 1:14 ;  1 John 3:9 ).  </p><p> This doctrine is not inconsistent with the truth that the believer may nevertheless fall into grievous sin, and continue therein for some time. (See BACKSLIDE .) </p>
Persia	<p>an ancient empire, extending from the Indus to Thrace, and from the Caspian Sea to the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. The Persians were originally a Medic tribe which settled in Persia, on the eastern side of the Persian Gulf. They were Aryans, their language belonging to the eastern division of the Indo-European group. One of their chiefs, Teispes, conquered Elam in the time of the decay of the Assyrian Empire, and established himself in the district of Anzan. His descendants branched off into two lines, one line ruling in Anzan, while the other remained in Persia. Cyrus II., king of Anzan, finally united the divided power, conquered Media, Lydia, and Babylonia, and carried his arms into the far East. His son, Cambyses, added Egypt to the empire, which, however, fell to pieces after his death. It was reconquered and thoroughly organized by Darius, the son of Hystaspes, whose dominions extended from India to the Danube. </p>
Persis	<p>a female Christian at Rome whom Paul salutes ( Romans 16:12 ). She is spoken of as "beloved," and as having "laboured much in the Lord."  </p>
Peruda	<p>one whose descendants returned with Zerubbabel ( Ezra 2:55 ); called also Perida ( Nehemiah 7:57 ).  </p>
Peter	<p>originally called Simon (=Simeon ,i.e., "hearing"), a very common Jewish name in the New Testament. He was the son of Jona ( Matthew 16:17 ). His mother is nowhere named in Scripture. He had a younger brother called Andrew, who first brought him to Jesus ( John 1:40-42 ). His native town was Bethsaida, on the western coast of the Sea of Galilee, to which also Philip belonged. Here he was brought up by the shores of the Sea of Galilee, and was trained to the occupation of a fisher. His father had probably died while he was still young, and he and his brother were brought up under the care of Zebedee and his wife Salome ( Matthew 27:56 ;  Mark 15:40 ;  16:1 ). There the four youths, Simon, Andrew, James, and John, spent their boyhood and early manhood in constant fellowship. Simon and his brother doubtless enjoyed all the advantages of a religious training, and were early instructed in an acquaintance with the Scriptures and with the great prophecies regarding the coming of the Messiah. They did not probably enjoy, however, any special training in the study of the law under any of the rabbis. When Peter appeared before the Sanhedrin, he looked like an "unlearned man" ( Acts 4:13 ).  </p><p> "Simon was a Galilean, and he was that out and out...The Galileans had a marked character of their own. They had a reputation for an independence and energy which often ran out into turbulence. They were at the same time of a franker and more transparent disposition than their brethren in the south. In all these respects, in bluntness, impetuosity, headiness, and simplicity, Simon was a genuine Galilean. They spoke a peculiar dialect. They had a difficulty with the guttural sounds and some others, and their pronunciation was reckoned harsh in Judea. The Galilean accent stuck to Simon all through his career. It betrayed him as a follower of Christ when he stood within the judgment-hall ( Mark 14:70 ). It betrayed his own nationality and that of those conjoined with him on the day of Pentecost ( Acts 2:7 )." It would seem that Simon was married before he became an apostle. His wife's mother is referred to ( Matthew 8:14 ;  Mark 1:30 ;  Luke 4:38 ). He was in all probability accompanied by his wife on his missionary journeys ( 1 Corinthians 9:5 ; Compare  1 Peter 5:13 ).  </p><p> He appears to have been settled at Capernaum when Christ entered on his public ministry, and may have reached beyond the age of thirty. His house was large enough to give a home to his brother Andrew, his wife's mother, and also to Christ, who seems to have lived with him ( Mark 1:29 Mark 1:36 ;  2:1 ), as well as to his own family. It was apparently two stories high ( 2:4 ).  </p><p> At Bethabara (RSV,  John 1:28 , "Bethany"), beyond Jordan, John the Baptist had borne testimony concerning Jesus as the "Lamb of God" ( John 1:29-36 ). Andrew and John hearing it, followed Jesus, and abode with him where he was. They were convinced, by his gracious words and by the authority with which he spoke, that he was the Messiah ( Luke 4:22 ;  Matthew 7:29 ); and Andrew went forth and found Simon and brought him to Jesus ( John 1:41 ).  </p><p> Jesus at once recognized Simon, and declared that hereafter he would be called Cephas, an Aramaic name corresponding to the Greek Petros, which means "a mass of rock detached from the living rock." The Aramaic name does not occur again, but the name Peter gradually displaces the old name Simon, though our Lord himself always uses the name Simon when addressing him ( Matthew 17:25 ;  Mark 14:37 ;  Luke 22:31 , comp  21:15-17 ). We are not told what impression the first interview with Jesus produced on the mind of Simon. When we next meet him it is by the Sea of Galilee ( Matthew 4:18-22 ). There the four (Simon and Andrew, James and John) had had an unsuccessful night's fishing. Jesus appeared suddenly, and entering into Simon's boat, bade him launch forth and let down the nets. He did so, and enclosed a great multitude of fishes. This was plainly a miracle wrought before Simon's eyes. The awe-stricken disciple cast himself at the feet of Jesus, crying, "Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord" ( Luke 5:8 ). Jesus addressed him with the assuring words, "Fear not," and announced to him his life's work. Simon responded at once to the call to become a disciple, and after this we find him in constant attendance on our Lord.  </p><p> He is next called into the rank of the apostleship, and becomes a "fisher of men" ( Matthew 4:19 ) in the stormy seas of the world of human life ( Matthew 10:2-4 ;  Mark 3:13-19 ;  Luke 6:13-16 ), and takes a more and more prominent part in all the leading events of our Lord's life. It is he who utters that notable profession of faith at Capernaum ( John 6:66-69 ), and again at Caesarea Philippi ( Matthew 16:13-20 ;  Mark 8:27-30 ;  Luke 9:18-20 ). This profession at Caesarea was one of supreme importance, and our Lord in response used these memorable words: "Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church."  </p><p> "From that time forth" Jesus began to speak of his sufferings. For this Peter rebuked him. But our Lord in return rebuked Peter, speaking to him in sterner words than he ever used to any other of his disciples ( Matthew 16:21-23 ;  Mark 8:31-33 ). At the close of his brief sojourn at Caesarea our Lord took Peter and James and John with him into "an high mountain apart," and was transfigured before them. Peter on that occasion, under the impression the scene produced on his mind, exclaimed, "Lord, it is good for us to be here: let us make three tabernacles" ( Matthew 17:1-9 ).  </p><p> On his return to Capernaum the collectors of the temple tax (a didrachma, half a sacred shekel), which every Israelite of twenty years old and upwards had to pay ( Exodus 30:15 ), came to Peter and reminded him that Jesus had not paid it ( Matthew 17:24-27 ). Our Lord instructed Peter to go and catch a fish in the lake and take from its mouth the exact amount needed for the tax, viz., a stater, or two half-shekels. "That take," said our Lord, "and give unto them for me and thee."  </p><p> As the end was drawing nigh, our Lord sent Peter and John ( Luke 22:7-13 ) into the city to prepare a place where he should keep the feast with his disciples. There he was forewarned of the fearful sin into which he afterwards fell ( 22:31-34 ). He accompanied our Lord from the guest-chamber to the garden of Gethsemane ( Luke 22:39-46 ), which he and the other two who had been witnesses of the transfiguration were permitted to enter with our Lord, while the rest were left without. Here he passed through a strange experience. Under a sudden impulse he cut off the ear of Malchus (47-51), one of the band that had come forth to take Jesus. Then follow the scenes of the judgment-hall (54-61) and his bitter grief (62).  </p><p> He is found in John's company early on the morning of the resurrection. He boldly entered into the empty grave ( John 20:1-10 ), and saw the "linen clothes laid by themselves" ( Luke 24:9-12 ). To him, the first of the apostles, our risen Lord revealed himself, thus conferring on him a signal honour, and showing how fully he was restored to his favour ( Luke 24:34 ;  1 Corinthians 15:5 ). We next read of our Lord's singular interview with Peter on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, where he thrice asked him, "Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?" ( John 21:1-19 ). (See LOVE .) </p><p> After this scene at the lake we hear nothing of Peter till he again appears with the others at the ascension ( Acts 1:15-26 ). It was he who proposed that the vacancy caused by the apostasy of Judas should be filled up. He is prominent on the day of Pentecost ( 2:14-40 ). The events of that day "completed the change in Peter himself which the painful discipline of his fall and all the lengthened process of previous training had been slowly making. He is now no more the unreliable, changeful, self-confident man, ever swaying between rash courage and weak timidity, but the stead-fast, trusted guide and director of the fellowship of believers, the intrepid preacher of Christ in Jerusalem and abroad. And now that he is become Cephas indeed, we hear almost nothing of the name Simon (only in  Acts 10:5 Acts 10:32 ;  15:14 ), and he is known to us finally as Peter."  </p><p> After the miracle at the temple gate ( Acts 3 ) persecution arose against the Christians, and Peter was cast into prison. He boldly defended himself and his companions at the bar of the council ( Acts 4:19 Acts 4:20 ). A fresh outburst of violence against the Christians ( 5:17-21 ) led to the whole body of the apostles being cast into prison; but during the night they were wonderfully delivered, and were found in the morning teaching in the temple. A second time Peter defended them before the council ( Acts 5:29-32 ), who, "when they had called the apostles and beaten them, let them go."  </p><p> The time had come for Peter to leave Jerusalem. After labouring for some time in Samaria, he returned to Jerusalem, and reported to the church there the results of his work ( Acts 8:14-25 ). Here he remained for a period, during which he met Paul for the first time since his conversion ( 9:26-30 ;  Galatians 1:18 ). Leaving Jerusalem again, he went forth on a missionary journey to Lydda and Joppa ( Acts 9:32-43 ). He is next called on to open the door of the Christian church to the Gentiles by the admission of Cornelius of Caesarea (ch. 10).  </p><p> After remaining for some time at Caesarea, he returned to Jerusalem ( Acts 11:1-18 ), where he defended his conduct with reference to the Gentiles. Next we hear of his being cast into prison by Herod Agrippa ( 12:1-19 ); but in the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison gates, and he went forth and found refuge in the house of Mary.  </p><p> He took part in the deliberations of the council in Jerusalem ( Acts 15:1-31 ;  Galatians 2:1-10 ) regarding the relation of the Gentiles to the church. This subject had awakened new interest at Antioch, and for its settlement was referred to the council of the apostles and elders at Jerusalem. Here Paul and Peter met again.  </p><p> We have no further mention of Peter in the Acts of the Apostles. He seems to have gone down to Antioch after the council at Jerusalem, and there to have been guilty of dissembling, for which he was severely reprimanded by Paul ( Galatians 2:11-16 ), who "rebuked him to his face."  </p><p> After this he appears to have carried the gospel to the east, and to have laboured for a while at Babylon, on the Euphrates ( 1 Peter 5:13 ). There is no satisfactory evidence that he was ever at Rome. Where or when he died is not certainly known. Probably he died between A.D. 64 and 67.  </p>
Peter, First Epistle of	<p>This epistle is addressed to "the strangers scattered abroad", i.e., to the Jews of the Dispersion (the Diaspora). </p><p> Its object is to confirm its readers in the doctrines they had been already taught. Peter has been called "the apostle of hope," because this epistle abounds with words of comfort and encouragement fitted to sustain a "lively hope." It contains about thirty-five references to the Old Testament. </p><p> It was written from Babylon, on the Euphrates, which was at this time one of the chief seats of Jewish learning, and a fitting centre for labour among the Jews. It has been noticed that in the beginning of his epistle Peter names the provinces of Asia Minor in the order in which they would naturally occur to one writing from Babylon. He counsels (1) to steadfastness and perseverance under persecution ( (1-2:10); ); (2) to the practical duties of a holy life ( (2:11-3:13); ); (3) he adduces the example of Christ and other motives to patience and holiness ( (3:14-4:19); ); and (4) concludes with counsels to pastors and people (ch. 5).  </p>
Peter, Second Epistle of	<p>The question of the authenticity of this epistle has been much discussed, but the weight of evidence is wholly in favour of its claim to be the production of the apostle whose name it bears. It appears to have been written shortly before the apostle's death ( 1:14 ). This epistle contains eleven references to the Old Testament. It also contains ( 1 Peter 3:15 1 Peter 3:16 ) a remarkable reference to Paul's epistles. Some think this reference is to  1 Thessalonians 4:13-5:11. . A few years ago, among other documents, a parchment fragment, called the "Gospel of Peter," was discovered in a Christian tomb at Akhmim in Upper Egypt. Origen (obiit A.D. 254), Eusebius (obiit 340), and Jerome (obiit 420) refer to such a work, and hence it has been concluded that it was probably written about the middle of the second century. It professes to give a history of our Lord's resurrection and ascension. While differing in not a few particulars from the canonical Gospels, the writer shows plainly that he was acquinted both with the synoptics and with the Gospel of John. Though apocryphal, it is of considerable value as showing that the main facts of the history of our Lord were then widely known.  </p>

Pharaoh	<p>the official title borne by the Egyptian kings down to the time when that country was conquered by the Greeks. (See EGYPT .) The name is a compound, as some think, of the words Ra, the "sun" or "sun-god," and the article phe, "the," prefixed; hence phera, "the sun," or "the sun-god." But others, perhaps more correctly, think the name derived from Perao, "the great house" = his majesty = in Turkish, "the Sublime Porte." </p><li> The Pharaoh who was on the throne when Abram went down into Egypt ( Genesis 12:10-20 ) was probably one of the Hyksos, or "shepherd kings." The Egyptians called the nomad tribes of Syria Shasu, "plunderers," their king or chief Hyk, and hence the name of those invaders who conquered the native kings and established a strong government, with Zoan or Tanis as their capital. They were of Semitic origin, and of kindred blood accordingly with Abram. They were probably driven forward by the pressure of the Hittites. The name they bear on the monuments is "Mentiu."  </li><li> The Pharaoh of Joseph's days ( Genesis 41 ) was probably Apopi, or Apopis, the last of the Hyksos kings. To the old native Egyptians, who were an African race, shepherds were "an abomination;" but to the Hyksos kings these Asiatic shepherds who now appeared with Jacob at their head were congenial, and being akin to their own race, had a warm welcome ( Genesis 47:5 Genesis 47:6 ). Some argue that Joseph came to Egypt in the reign of Thothmes III., long after the expulsion of the Hyksos, and that his influence is to be seen in the rise and progress of the religious revolution in the direction of monotheism which characterized the middle of the Eighteenth Dynasty. The wife of Amenophis III., of that dynasty, was a Semite. Is this singular fact to be explained from the presence of some of Joseph's kindred at the Egyptian court? Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee: the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell" ( Genesis 47:5 Genesis 47:6 ).  </li><li> The "new king who knew not Joseph" ( Exodus 1:8-22 ) has been generally supposed to have been Aahmes I., or Amosis, as he is called by Josephus. Recent discoveries, however, have led to the conclusion that Seti was the "new king."  <p> For about seventy years the Hebrews in Egypt were under the powerful protection of Joseph. After his death their condition was probably very slowly and gradually changed. The invaders, the Hyksos, who for some five centuries had been masters of Egypt, were driven out, and the old dynasty restored. The Israelites now began to be looked down upon. They began to be afflicted and tyrannized over. In process of time a change appears to have taken place in the government of Egypt. A new dynasty, the Nineteenth, as it is called, came into power under Seti I., who was its founder. He associated with him in his government his son, Rameses II., when he was yet young, probably ten or twelve years of age. </p><p> Note, Professor Maspero, keeper of the museum of Bulak, near Cairo, had his attention in 1870 directed to the fact that scarabs, i.e., stone and metal imitations of the beetle (symbols of immortality), originally worn as amulets by royal personages, which were evidently genuine relics of the time of the ancient Pharaohs, were being sold at Thebes and different places along the Nile. This led him to suspect that some hitherto undiscovered burial-place of the Pharaohs had been opened, and that these and other relics, now secretly sold, were a part of the treasure found there. For a long time he failed, with all his ingenuity, to find the source of these rare treasures. At length one of those in the secret volunteered to give information regarding this burial-place. The result was that a party was conducted in 1881 to Dier el-Bahari, near Thebes, when the wonderful discovery was made of thirty-six mummies of kings, queens, princes, and high priests hidden away in a cavern prepared for them, where they had lain undisturbed for thirty centuries. "The temple of Deir el-Bahari stands in the middle of a natural amphitheatre of cliffs, which is only one of a number of smaller amphitheatres into which the limestone mountains of the tombs are broken up. In the wall of rock separating this basin from the one next to it some ancient Egyptian engineers had constructed the hiding-place, whose secret had been kept for nearly three thousand years." The exploring party being guided to the place, found behind a great rock a shaft 6 feet square and about 40 feet deep, sunk into the limestone. At the bottom of this a passage led westward for 25 feet, and then turned sharply northward into the very heart of the mountain, where in a chamber 23 feet by 13, and 6 feet in height, they came upon the wonderful treasures of antiquity. The mummies were all carefully secured and brought down to Bulak, where they were deposited in the royal museum, which has now been removed to Ghizeh.  </p><p> Among the most notable of the ancient kings of Egypt thus discovered were Thothmes III., Seti I., and Rameses II. Thothmes III. was the most distinguished monarch of the brilliant Eighteenth Dynasty. When this mummy was unwound "once more, after an interval of thirty-six centuries, human eyes gazed on the features of the man who had conquered Syria and Cyprus and Ethiopia, and had raised Egypt to the highest pinnacle of her power. The spectacle, however, was of brief duration. The remains proved to be in so fragile a state that there was only time to take a hasty photograph, and then the features crumbled to pieces and vanished like an apparition, and so passed away from human view for ever." "It seems strange that though the body of this man," who overran Palestine with his armies two hundred years before the birth of Moses, "mouldered to dust, the flowers with which it had been wreathed were so wonderfully preserved that even their colour could be distinguished" (Manning's Land of the Pharaohs). </p><p> Seti I. (his throne name Merenptah), the father of Rameses II., was a great and successful warrior, also a great builder. The mummy of this Pharaoh, when unrolled, brought to view "the most beautiful mummy head ever seen within the walls of the museum. The sculptors of Thebes and Abydos did not flatter this Pharaoh when they gave him that delicate, sweet, and smiling profile which is the admiration of travellers. After a lapse of thirty-two centuries, the mummy retains the same expression which characterized the features of the living man. Most remarkable of all, when compared with the mummy of Rameses II., is the striking resemblance between the father and the son. Seti I. is, as it were, the idealized type of Rameses II. He must have died at an advanced age. The head is shaven, the eyebrows are white, the condition of the body points to considerably more than threescore years of life, thus confirming the opinions of the learned, who have attributed a long reign to this king." </p></li><li> Rameses II., the son of Seti I., is probably the Pharaoh of the Oppression. During his forty years' residence at the court of Egypt, Moses must have known this ruler well. During his sojourn in Midian, however, Rameses died, after a reign of sixty-seven years, and his body embalmed and laid in the royal sepulchre in the Valley of the Tombs of Kings beside that of his father. Like the other mummies found hidden in the cave of Deir el-Bahari, it had been for some reason removed from its original tomb, and probably carried from place to place till finally deposited in the cave where it was so recently discovered.  <p> In 1886, the mummy of this king, the "great Rameses," the "Sesostris" of the Greeks, was unwound, and showed the body of what must have been a robust old man. The features revealed to view are thus described by Maspero: "The head is long and small in proportion to the body. The top of the skull is quite bare. On the temple there are a few sparse hairs, but at the poll the hair is quite thick, forming smooth, straight locks about two inches in length. White at the time of death, they have been dyed a light yellow by the spices used in embalmment. The forehead is low and narrow; the brow-ridge prominent; the eye-brows are thick and white; the eyes are small and close together; the nose is long, thin, arched like the noses of the Bourbons; the temples are sunk; the cheek-bones very prominent; the ears round, standing far out from the head, and pierced, like those of a woman, for the wearing of earrings; the jaw-bone is massive and strong; the chin very prominent; the mouth small, but thick-lipped; the teeth worn and very brittle, but white and well preserved. The moustache and beard are thin. They seem to have been kept shaven during life, but were probably allowed to grow during the king's last illness, or they may have grown after death. The hairs are white, like those of the head and eyebrows, but are harsh and bristly, and a tenth of an inch in length. The skin is of an earthy-brown, streaked with black. Finally, it may be said, the face of the mummy gives a fair idea of the face of the living king. The expression is unintellectual, perhaps slightly animal; but even under the somewhat grotesque disguise of mummification there is plainly to be seen an air of sovereign majesty, of resolve, and of pride."  </p><p> Both on his father's and his mother's side it has been pretty clearly shown that Rameses had Chaldean or Mesopotamian blood in his veins to such a degree that he might be called an Assyrian. This fact is thought to throw light on  Isaiah 52:4 .  </p></li><li> The Pharaoh of the Exodus was probably Menephtah I., the fourteenth and eldest surviving son of Rameses II. He resided at Zoan, where he had the various interviews with Moses and Aaron recorded in the book of Exodus. His mummy was not among those found at Deir el-Bahari. It is still a question, however, whether Seti II. or his father Menephtah was the Pharaoh of the Exodus. Some think the balance of evidence to be in favour of the former, whose reign it is known began peacefully, but came to a sudden and disastrous end. The "Harris papyrus," found at Medinet-Abou in Upper Egypt in 1856, a state document written by Rameses III., the second king of the Twentieth Dynasty, gives at length an account of a great exodus from Egypt, followed by wide-spread confusion and anarchy. This, there is great reason to believe, was the Hebrew exodus, with which the Nineteenth Dynasty of the Pharaohs came to an end. This period of anarchy was brought to a close by Setnekht, the founder of the Twentieth Dynasty.  <p> "In the spring of 1896, Professor Flinders Petrie discovered, among the ruins of the temple of Menephtah at Thebes, a large granite stela, on which is engraved a hymn of victory commemorating the defeat of Libyan invaders who had overrun the Delta. At the end other victories of Menephtah are glanced at, and it is said that 'the Israelites (I-s-y-r-a-e-l-u) are minished (?) so that they have no seed.' Menephtah was son and successor of Rameses II., the builder of Pithom, and Egyptian scholars have long seen in him the Pharaoh of the Exodus. The Exodus is also placed in his reign by the Egyptian legend of the event preserved by the historian Manetho. In the inscription the name of the Israelites has no determinative of 'country' or 'district' attached to it, as is the case with all the other names (Canaan, Ashkelon, Gezer, Khar or Southern Palestine, etc.) mentioned along with it, and it would therefore appear that at the time the hymn was composed, the Israelites had already been lost to the sight of the Egyptians in the desert. At all events they must have had as yet no fixed home or district of their own. We may therefore see in the reference to them the Pharaoh's version of the Exodus, the disasters which befell the Egyptians being naturally passed over in silence, and only the destruction of the 'men children' of the Israelites being recorded. The statement of the Egyptian poet is a remarkable parallel to  Exodus 1:10-22 ."  </p></li><li> The Pharaoh of  1 Kings 11:18-22 .  </li><li> So, king of Egypt ( 2 Kings 17:4 ).  </li><li> The Pharaoh of  1 Chronicles 4:18 .  </li><li> Pharaoh, whose daughter Solomon married ( 1 Kings 3:1 ;  7:8 ).  </li><li> Pharaoh, in whom Hezekiah put his trust in his war against Sennacherib ( 2 Kings 18:21 ).  </li><li> The Pharaoh by whom Josiah was defeated and slain at Megiddo ( 2 Chronicles 35:20-24 ;  2 Kings  <span class="badLink">2 Chronicles 23:29</span> <span class="badLink">2 Chronicles 23:30</span> ).

Pharaohs daughters	<p>Three princesses are thus mentioned in Scripture: </p><li> The princess who adopted the infant Moses (q.v.),  Exodus 2:10 . She is twice mentioned in the New Testament ( Acts 7:21 :  Hebrews 11:24 ). It would seem that she was alive and in some position of influence about the court when Moses was compelled to flee from Egypt, and thus for forty years he had in some way been under her influence. She was in all probability the sister of Rameses, and the daughter of Seti I. Josephus calls her Thermuthis. It is supposed by some that she was Nefert-ari, the wife as well as sister of Rameses.

God "rained flesh upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea" ( Psalms 78:27 ). The words in  Numbers 11:31 , according to the Authorized Version, appear to denote that the quails lay one above another to the thickness of two cubits above the ground. The Revised Version, however, reads, "about two cubits above the face of the earth", i.e., the quails flew at this height, and were easily killed or caught by the hand. Being thus secured in vast numbers by the people, they "spread them all abroad" ( 11:32 ) in order to salt and dry them.  </p><p> These birds (the Coturnix vulgaris of naturalists) are found in countless numbers on the shores of the Mediterranean, and their annual migration is an event causing great excitement. </p>

Quarries	<p></p><li> The "Royal Quarries" (not found in Scripture) is the name given to the vast caverns stretching far underneath the northern hill, Bezetha, on which Jerusalem is built. Out of these mammoth caverns stones, a hard lime-stone, have been quarried in ancient times for the buildings in the city, and for the temples of Solomon, Zerubbabel, and Herod. Huge blocks of stone are still found in these caves bearing the marks of pick and chisel. The general appearance of the whole suggests to the explorer the idea that the Phoenician quarrymen have just suspended their work. The supposition that the polished blocks of stone for Solomon's temple were sent by Hiram from Lebanon or Tyre is not supported by any evidence (Compare  1 Kings 5:8 ). Hiram sent masons and stone-squarers to Jerusalem to assist Solomon's workmen in their great undertaking, but did not send stones to Jerusalem, where, indeed, they were not needed, as these royal quarries abundantly testify.  </li><li> The "quarries" (Heb. pesilim) by Gilgal ( Judges 3:19 ), from which Ehud turned back for the purpose of carrying out his design to put Eglon king of Moab to death, were probably the "graven images" (as the word is rendered by the LXX. and the Vulgate and in the marg. A.V. and RSV), or the idol temples the Moabites had erected at Gilgal, where the children of Israel first encamped after crossing the Jordan. The Hebrew word is rendered "graven images" in  Deuteronomy 7:25 , and is not elsewhere translated "quarries."   </li>
Quartus	<p>fourth, a Corinthian Christian who sent by Paul his salutations to friends at Rome ( Romans 16:23 ).  </p>
Quaternion	<p>a band of four soldiers. Peter was committed by Herod to the custody of four quaternions, i.e., one quaternion for each watch of the night ( Acts 12:4 ). Thus every precaution was taken against his escape from prison. Two of each quaternion were in turn stationed at the door ( 12:6 ), and to two the apostle was chained according to Roman custom.  </p>
Raamah	<p>thunder. </p><li> One of the sons of Cush ( Genesis 10:7 ). </li><li> A country which traded with Tyre ( Ezekiel 27:22 ).   </li>
Raamiah	<p>thunder of the Lord, one of the princes who returned from the Exile ( Nehemiah 7:7 ); called also Reelaiah ( Ezra 2:2 ).  </p>
Raamses	<p>( Exodus 1:11 ). (See RAMESES .) </p>
Rabbah	<p>or Rab'bath, great. </p><li> "Rabbath of the children of Ammon," the chief city of the Ammonites, among the eastern hills, some 20 miles east of the Jordan, on the southern of the two streams which united with the Jabbok. Here the bedstead of Og was preserved ( Deuteronomy 3:11 ), perhaps as a trophy of some victory gained by the Ammonites over the king of Bashan. After David had subdued all their allies in a great war, he sent Joab with a strong force to take their city. For two years it held out against its assailants. It was while his army was engaged in this protracted siege that David was guilty of that deed of shame which left a blot on his character and cast a gloom over the rest of his life. At length, having taken the "royal city" (or the "city of waters,"  2 Samuel 12:27 , i.e., the lower city on the river, as distinguished from the citadel), Joab sent for David to direct the final assault ( 11:1 ;  12:26-31 ). The city was given up to plunder, and the people were ruthlessly put to death, and "thus did he with all the cities of the children of Ammon." The destruction of Rabbath was the last of David's conquests. His kingdom now reached its farthest limits ( 2 Samuel 8:1-15 ;  1 Chronicles 18:1-15 ). The capture of this city is referred to by ( Amos 1:14 ), ( Jeremiah 49:2 Jeremiah 49:3 ), and ( Ezekiel 21:20 ;  25:5 ).  </li><li> A city in the hill country of Judah ( Joshua 15:60 ), possibly the ruin Rubba, six miles north-east of Beit-Jibrin.   </li>
Rabbi	<p>my master, a title of dignity given by the Jews to their doctors of the law and their distinguished teachers. It is sometimes applied to Christ ( Matthew 23:7 Matthew 23:8 ;  Mark 9:5  (RSV);  John 1:38 John 1:49 ;  3:2 ;  6:25 , etc.); also to ( John 3:26 ).  </p>
Rabboni	<p>(id.) occurs only twice in the New Testament ( Mark 10:51 , A.V., "Lord," RSV, "Rabboni;"  John 20:16 ). It was the most honourable of all the titles.  </p>
Rabmag	<p>Assyrian Rab-mugi, "chief physician," "who was attached to the king ( Jeremiah 39:3 Jeremiah 39:13 ), the title of one of Sennacherib's officers sent with messages to Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem ( 2 Kings 18:17-19:13; ;  Isaiah 36:12-37:13) ) demanding the surrender of the city. He was accompanied by a "great army;" but his mission was unsuccessful.  </p>
Rabsaris	<p>chief of the Heads, one of the three officers whom Sennacherib sent from Lachish with a threatening message to Jerusalem ( 2 Kings 18:17 ;  Jeremiah 39:3 Jeremiah 39:13 ).  </p>
Rabshakeh	<p>chief of the princes, the name given to the chief cup-bearer or the vizier of the Assyrian court; one of Sennacherib's messengers to Hezekiah. See the speech he delivered, in the Hebrew language, in the hearing of all the people, as he stood near the wall on the north side of the city ( 2 Kings 18:17-37 ). He and the other envoys returned to their master and reported that Hezekiah and his people were obdurate, and would not submit.  </p>
Raca	<p>vain, empty, worthless, only found in  Matthew 5:22 . The Jews used it as a word of contempt. It is derived from a root meaning "to spit."  </p>
Rachab	<p>=Rahab, a name found in the genealogy of our Lord ( Matthew 1:5 ).  </p>
Rachal	<p>traffic, a town in the tribe of Judah, to which David sent presents from the spoils of his enemies ( 1 Samuel 30:29 ).  </p>
Rachel	<p>ewe, "the daughter", "the somewhat petulant, peevish, and self-willed though beautiful younger daughter" of Laban, and one of Jacob's wives ( Genesis 29:6 Genesis 29:28 ). He served Laban fourteen years for her, so deep was Jacob's affection for her. She was the mother of Joseph ( Genesis 30:22-24 ). Afterwards, on Jacob's departure from Mesopotamia, she took with her her father's teraphim ( Genesis 31:34 Genesis 31:35 ). As they journeyed on from Bethel, Rachel died in giving birth to Benjamin ( Genesis 35:18 Genesis 35:19 ), and was buried "in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem. And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave". Her sepulchre is still regarded with great veneration by the Jews. Its traditional site is about half a mile from Jerusalem.  </p><p> This name is used poetically by ( Jeremiah 31:15-17 ) to denote God's people mourning under their calamities. This passage is also quoted by Matthew as fulfilled in the lamentation at Bethlehem on account of the slaughter of the infants there at the command of Herod ( Matthew 2:17 Matthew 2:18 ).  </p>
Raguel	<p>friend of God, (Nu 10:29)=Reuel (q.v.),  Exodus 2:18 , the father-in-law of Moses, and probably identical with Jethro (q.v.).  </p>
Rahab	<p>insolence; pride, a poetical name applied to Egypt in  Psalms 87:4 ;  89:10 ;  Isaiah 51:9 , as "the proud one."  </p><p> Rahab, (Heb. Rahab; i.e., "broad," "large"). When the Hebrews were encamped at Shittim, in the "Arabah" or Jordan valley opposite Jericho, ready to cross the river, Joshua, as a final preparation, sent out two spies to "spy the land." After five days they returned, having swum across the river, which at this season, the month Abib, overflowed its banks from the melting of the snow on Lebanon. The spies reported how it had fared with them ( Joshua 2:1-7 ). They had been exposed to danger in Jericho, and had been saved by the fidelity of Rahab the harlot, to whose house they had gone for protection. When the city of Jericho fell ( 6:17-25 ), Rahab and her whole family were preserved according to the promise of the spies, and were incorporated among the Jewish people. She afterwards became the wife of Salmon, a prince of the tribe of Judah ( Ruth 4:21 ;  1 Chronicles 2:11 ;  Matthew 1:5 ). "Rahab's being asked to bring out the spies to the soldiers ( Joshua 2:3 ) sent for them, is in strict keeping with Eastern manners, which would not permit any man to enter a woman's house without her permission. The fact of her covering the spies with bundles of flax which lay on her house-roof ( 2:6 ) is an 'undesigned coincidence' which strictly corroborates the narrative. It was the time of the barley harvest, and flax and barley are ripe at the same time in the Jordan valley, so that the bundles of flax stalks might have been expected to be drying just then" (Geikie's Hours, etc., ii., 390).  </p>
Raham	<p>merciful, one of the descendants of Caleb, the son of Hezron ( 1 Chronicles 2:44 ).  </p>
Rain	<p>There are three Hebrew words used to denote the rains of different seasons, </p><li> Yoreh ( Hosea 6:3 ), or moreh ( Joel 2:23 ), denoting the former or the early rain. </li><li> Melqosh, the "latter rain" ( Proverbs 16:15 ). </li><li> Geshem, the winter rain, "the rains." The heavy winter rain is mentioned in  Genesis 7:12 ;  Ezra 10:9 ; Cant  2:11 . The "early" or "former" rains commence in autumn in the latter part of October or beginning of November ( Deuteronomy 11:14 ;  Joel 2:23 ; Compare  Jeremiah 3:3 ), and continue to fall heavily for two months. Then the heavy "winter rains" fall from the middle of December to March. There is no prolonged fair weather in Palestine between October and March. The "latter" or spring rains fall in March and April, and serve to swell the grain then coming to maturity ( Deuteronomy 11:14 ;  Hosea 6:3 ). After this there is ordinarily no rain, the sky being bright and cloudless till October or November.  <p> Rain is referred to symbolically in  Deuteronomy 32:2 ;  Psalms 72:6 ;  Isaiah 44:3 Isaiah 44:4 ;  Hosea 10:12 .  </p> </li>
Rainbow	<p>caused by the reflection and refraction of the rays of the sun shining on falling rain. It was appointed as a witness of the divine faithfulness ( Genesis 9:12-17 ). It existed indeed before, but it was then constituted as a sign of the covenant. Others, however (as Delitzsch, Commentary on Pentateuch), think that it "appeared then for the first time in the vault and clouds of heaven." It is argued by those holding this opinion that the atmosphere was differently constituted before the Flood. It is referred to three other times in Scripture ( Ezekiel 1:27 Ezekiel 1:28 ;  Revelation 4:1-3 ;  10:1 ).  </p>
Raisins	<p>dried grapes; mentioned  1 Samuel 25:18 ;  30:12 ;  2 Sam  16:1 ;  1 Chronicles 12:40 .  </p>
Rakkath	<p>shore-town, a "fenced city" of the tribe of Naphtali ( Joshua 19:35 ). The old name of Tiberias, according to the Rabbins.  </p>
Rakkon	<p>a place upon the shore, a town belonging to Dan ( Joshua 19:46 ). It is now Tell er-Rakkeit, 6 miles north of Joppa, on the sea-shore, near the mouth of the river 'Aujeh, i.e., "yellow water." (See KANAH .) </p>
Ram	<p>exalted. </p><li> The son of Hezron, and one of the ancestors of the royal line ( Ruth 4:19 ). The margin of  1 Chronicles 2:9 , also Matt. 1:3,4and  Luke 3:33 , have "Aram."  </li><li> One of the sons of Jerahmeel ( 1 Chronicles 2:25 1 Chronicles 2:27 ).  </li><li> A person mentioned in  Job 32:2  as founder of a clan to which Elihu belonged. The same as Aram of  Genesis 22:21 .   </li>
Rama	<p>( Matthew 2:18 ), the Greek form of Ramah. </p><li> A city first mentioned in  Joshua 18:25 , near Gibeah of Benjamin. It was fortified by Baasha, king of Israel ( 1 Kings 15:17-22 ;  2 Chr.  16:1-6 ). Asa, king of Judah, employed Benhadad the Syrian king to drive Baasha from this city ( 1 Kings 15:18 1 Kings 15:20 ). ( Isaiah 10:29 ) refers to it, and also Jeremiah, who was once a prisoner there among the other captives of Jerusalem when it was taken by Nebuchadnezzar ( Jeremiah 39:8-12 ;  40:1 ). Rachel, whose tomb lies close to Bethlehem, is represented as weeping in Ramah ( Jeremiah 31:15 ) for her slaughtered children. This prophecy is illustrated and fulfilled in the re-awakening of Rachel's grief at the slaughter of the infants in Bethlehem ( Matthew 2:18 ). It is identified with the modern village of er-Ram, between Gibeon and Beeroth, about 5 miles due north of Jerusalem. (See SAMUEL .) </li><li> A town identified with Rameh, on the border of Asher, about 13 miles south-east of Tyre, "on a solitary hill in the midst of a basin of green fields" ( Joshua 19:29 ).  </li><li> One of the "fenced cities" of Naphtali ( Joshua 19:36 ), on a mountain slope, about seven and a half miles west-south-west of Safed, and 15 miles west of the north end of the Sea of Galilee, the present large and well-built village of Rameh.  </li><li> The same as Ramathaim-zophim (q.v.), a town of Mount Ephraim ( 1 Samuel 1:1 1 Samuel 1:19 ).  </li><li> The same as Ramoth-gilead (q.v.),  2 Kings 8:29 ;  2 Chr.  22:6 .   </li>
Ramath of the south	<p>(Heb. Ramath-negeb). The Heb. negeb is the general designation for south or south-west of Judah. This was one of the towns of Simeon ( Joshua 19:8 ). It is the same as "south Ramoth" ( 1 Samuel 30:27 ; RSV, "Ramoth of the south"). Its site is doubtful. Some have thought it another name for Baalath-beer.  </p>
Ramathaim-zophim	<p>the two heights of the Zophites or of the watchers (only in  1 Samuel 1:1 ), "in the land of Zuph" ( 9:5 ). Ramathaim is another name for Ramah (4).  </p><p> One of the Levitical families descended from Kohath, that of Zuph or Zophai ( 1 Chronicles 6:26 1 Chronicles 6:35 ), had a district assigned to them in Ephraim, which from this circumstance was called "the land of Zuph," and hence the name of the town, "Zophim." It was the birth-place of Samuel and the seat of his authority ( 1 Samuel 2:11 ;  7:17 ). It is frequently mentioned in the history of that prophet and of David ( 15:34 ;  16:13 ;  19:18-23 ). Here Samuel died and was buried ( 25:1 ).  </p><p> This town has been identified with the modern Neby Samwil ("the prophet Samuel"), about 4 or 5 miles north-west of Jerusalem. But there is no certainty as to its precise locality. Some have supposed that it may be identical with Arimathea of the New Testament. (See MIZPAH).  </p>
Ramathite	<p>the designation given to Shimei, the manager of David's vineyard ( 1 Chronicles 27:27 ).  </p>
Ramath-lehi	<p>elevation of Lehi, or the jawbone height; i.e., the Ramah of Lehi ( Judges 15:15-17 ). The phrase "in the jaw," ver. 19, Authorized Version, is in the margin, also in the Revised Version, "in Lehi." Here Samson slew a thousand Philistines with a jawbone.  </p>
Ramath-mizpeh	<p>the height of Mizpeh or of the watch-tower ( Joshua 13:26 ), a place mentioned as one of the limits of Gad. There were two Mizpehs on the east of the Jordan. This was the Mizpeh where Jacob and Laban made a covenant, "Mizpeh of Gilead," called also Galeed and Jegar-sahadutha. It has been identified with the modern es-Salt, where the roads from Jericho and from Shechem to Damascus unite, about 25 miles east of the Jordan and 13 south of the Jabbok.  </p>
Rameses	<p>"the land of" ( Genesis 47:11 ), was probably "the land of Goshen" (q.v.)  45:10 . After the Hebrews had built Rameses, one of the "treasure cities," it came to be known as the "land" in which that city was built.  </p><p> The city bearing this name ( Exodus 12:37 ) was probably identical with Zoan, which Rameses II. ("son of the sun") rebuilt. It became his special residence, and ranked next in importance and magnificance to Thebes. Huge masses of bricks, made of Nile mud, sun-dried, some of them mixed with stubble, possibly moulded by Jewish hands, still mark the site of Rameses. This was the general rendezvous of the Israelites before they began their march out of Egypt. Called also Raamses ( Exodus 1:11 ).  </p>
Ramoth	<p>heights. A Levitical city in the tribe of Issachar ( 1 Samuel 30:27 ;  1 Chronicles 6:73 ), the same as Jarmuth ( Joshua 21:29 ) and Remeth (q.v.),  19:21 .  </p>
Ramoth-gilead	<p>heights of Gilead, a city of refuge on the east of Jordan; called "Ramoth in Gilead" ( Deuteronomy 4:43 ;  Joshua 20:8 ;  21:38 ). Here Ahab, who joined Jehoshaphat in an endeavour to rescue it from the hands of the king of Syria, was mortally wounded ( 1 Kings 22:1-36 ). A similar attempt was afterwards made by Ahaziah and Joram, when the latter was wounded ( 2 Kings 8:28 ). In this city Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, was anointed by one of the sons of the prophets ( 2 Kings 9:1 2 Kings 9:4 ).  </p><p> It has with probability been identified with Reimun, on the northern slope of the Jabbok, about 5 miles west of Jerash or Gerasa, one of the cities of Decapolis. Others identify it with Gerosh, about 25 miles north-east of es-Salt, with which also many have identified it. (See RAMATH-MIZPEH.)  </p>
Ranges	<p></p><li> Leviticus 11:35 . Probably a cooking furnace for two or more pots, as the Hebrew word here is in the dual number; or perhaps a fire-place fitted to receive a pair of ovens.  </li><li> 2 Kings 11:8 . A Hebrew word is here used different from the preceding, meaning "ranks of soldiers." The Levites were appointed to guard the king's person within the temple ( 2 Chronicles 23:7 ), while the soldiers were his guard in the court, and in going from the temple to the palace. The soldiers are here commanded to slay any one who should break through the "ranks" (as rendered in the RSV) to come near the king. In  2 Kings 11:15  the expression, "Have her forth without the ranges," is in the Revised Version, "Have her forth between the ranks;" i.e., Jehoiada orders that Athaliah should be kept surrounded by his own guards, and at the same time conveyed beyond the precincts of the temple.   </li>
Ransom	<p>the price or payment made for our redemption, as when it is said that the Son of man "gave his life a ransom for many" ( Matthew 20:28 ; Compare  Acts 20:28 ;  Romans 3:23 Romans 3:24 ;  1 Corinthians 6:19 1 Corinthians 6:20 ;  Galatians 3:13 ;  Galatians 4:4 Galatians 4:5 :  Ephesians 1:7 ;  Colossians 1:14 ;  1 Timothy 2:6 ;  Titus 2:14 ;  1 Peter 1:18 1 Peter 1:19 . In all these passages the same idea is expressed). This word is derived from the Fr. rancon; Lat. redemptio. The debt is represented not as cancelled but as fully paid. The slave or captive is not liberated by a mere gratuitous favour, but a ransom price has been paid, in consideration of which he is set free. The original owner receives back his alienated and lost possession because he has bought it back "with a price." This price or ransom (Gr. lutron) is always said to be Christ, his blood, his death. He secures our redemption by the payment of a ransom. (See REDEMPTION .) </p>
Rapha	<p>tall. </p><li> A Benjamite, the son of Binea ( 1 Chronicles 8:2 1 Chronicles 8:37 ), a descendant of Saul. </li><li> Margin of  1 Chronicles 20:4 1 Chronicles 20:6 , where "giant" is given in the text.   </li>
Raphu	<p>healed, a Benjamite, whose son Palti was one of the twelve spies ( Numbers 13:9 ).  </p>
Raven	<p>Heb. 'orebh, from a root meaning "to be black" (Compare Cant.  5:11 ); first mentioned as "sent forth" by Noah from the ark ( Genesis 8:7 ). "Every raven after his kind" was forbidden as food ( Leviticus 11:15 ;  Deuteronomy 14:14 ). Ravens feed mostly on carrion, and hence their food is procured with difficulty ( Job 38:41 ;  Psalms 147:9 ). When they attack kids or lambs or weak animals, it is said that they first pick out the eyes of their victims ( Proverbs 30:17 ). When Elijah was concealed by the brook Cherith, God commanded the ravens to bring him "bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening" ( 1 Kings 17:3-6 ). (See ELIJAH .) </p><p> There are eight species of ravens in Palestine, and they are everywhere very numerous in that land. </p>
Razor	<p>The Nazarites were forbidden to make use of the razor ( Numbers 6:5 ;  Judges 13:5 ). At their consecration the Levites were shaved all over with a razor ( Numbers 8:7 ; Compare  Psalms 52:2 ;  Ezekiel 5:1 ).  </p>
Reba	<p>fourth, one of the Midianite chiefs slain by the Israelites in the wilderness ( Numbers 31:8 ;  Joshua 13:21 ).  </p>
Rebekah	<p>a noose, the daughter of Bethuel, and the wife of Isaac ( Genesis 22:23 ;  24:67 ). The circumstances under which Abraham's "steward" found her at the "city of Nahor," in Padan-aram, are narrated in  Genesis 2427 -27. "She can hardly be regarded as an amiable woman. When we first see her she is ready to leave her father's house for ever at an hour's notice; and her future life showed not only a full share of her brother Laban's duplicity, but the grave fault of partiality in her relations to her children, and a strong will, which soon controlled the gentler nature of her husband." The time and circumstances of her death are not recorded, but it is said that she was buried in the cave of Machpelah ( Genesis 49:31 ).  </p>
Rechab	<p>horseman, or chariot. </p><li> One of Ishbosheth's "captains of bands" or leaders of predatory troops ( 2 Samuel 4:2 ).  </li><li> The father of Jehonadab, who was the father of the Rechabites ( 2 Kings 10:15 2 Kings 10:23 ;  Jeremiah 35:6-19 ).   </li>
Rechabites	<p>the descendants of Rechab through Jonadab or Jehonadab. They belonged to the Kenites, who accompanied the children of Israel into Palestine, and dwelt among them. Moses married a Kenite wife ( Judges 1:16 ), and Jael was the wife of "Heber the Kenite" ( 4:17 ). Saul also showed kindness to the Kenites ( 1 Samuel 15:6 ). The main body of the Kenites dwelt in cities, and adopted settled habits of life ( 30:29 ); but Jehonadab forbade his descendants to drink wine or to live in cities. They were commanded to lead always a nomad life. They adhered to the law laid down by Jonadab, and were noted for their fidelity to the old-established custom of their family in the days of Jeremiah (35); and this feature of their character is referred to by the prophet for the purpose of giving point to his own exhortation. They are referred to in  Nehemiah 3:14  and  1 Chronicles 2:55 . Dr. Wolff (1839) found in Arabia, near Mecca, a tribe claiming to be descendants of Jehonadab; and recently a Bedouin tribe has been found near the Dead Sea who also profess to be descendants of the same Kenite chief.  </p>
Reconcilation	<p>a change from enmity to friendship. It is mutual, i.e., it is a change wrought in both parties who have been at enmity. </p><li> In  Colossians 1:21 Colossians 1:22 , the word there used refers to a change wrought in the personal character of the sinner who ceases to be an enemy to God by wicked works, and yields up to him his full confidence and love. In  2 Corinthians 5:20  the apostle beseeches the Corinthians to be "reconciled to God", i.e., to lay aside their enmity.  </li><li> Romans 5:10  refers not to any change in our disposition toward God, but to God himself, as the party reconciled.  Romans 5:11  teaches the same truth. From God we have received "the reconciliation" (RSV), i.e., he has conferred on us the token of his friendship. So also 2co 5:18,19speaks of a reconciliation originating with God, and consisting in the removal of his merited wrath. In  Ephesians 2:16  it is clear that the apostle does not refer to the winning back of the sinner in love and loyalty to God, but to the restoration of God's forfeited favour. This is effected by his justice being satisfied, so that he can, in consistency with his own nature, be favourable toward sinners. Justice demands the punishment of sinners. The death of Christ satisfies justice, and so reconciles God to us. This reconciliation makes God our friend, and enables him to pardon and save us. (See ATONEMENT .)  </li>
Recorder	<p>(Heb. mazkir, i.e., "the mentioner," "rememberancer"), the office first held by Jehoshaphat in the court of David ( 2 Samuel 8:16 ), also in the court of Solomon ( 1 Kings 4:3 ). The next recorder mentioned is Joah, in the reign of Hezekiah ( 2 Kings 18:18 2 Kings 18:37 ;  Isaiah 36:3 Isaiah 36:22 ). In the reign of Josiah another of the name of Joah filled this office ( 2 Chronicles 34:8 ). The "recorder" was the chancellor or vizier of the kingdom. He brought all weighty matters under the notice of the king, "such as complaints, petitions, and wishes of subjects or foreigners. He also drew up papers for the king's guidance, and prepared drafts of the royal will for the scribes. All treaties came under his oversight; and he had the care of the national archives or records, to which, as royal historiographer, like the same state officer in Assyria and Egypt, he added the current annals of the kingdom."  </p>
Red Sea	<p>The sea so called extends along the west coast of Arabia for about 1,400 miles, and separates Asia from Africa. It is connected with the Indian Ocean, of which it is an arm, by the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb. At a point (Ras Mohammed) about 200 miles from its nothern extremity it is divided into two arms, that on the east called the AElanitic Gulf, now the Bahr el-'Akabah, about 100 miles long by 15 broad, and that on the west the Gulf of Suez, about 150 miles long by about 20 broad. This branch is now connected with the Mediterranean by the Suez Canal. Between these two arms lies the Sinaitic Peninsula.  </p><p> The Hebrew name generally given to this sea is <i> Yam Suph</i> . This word <i> suph</i> means a woolly kind of sea-weed, which the sea casts up in great abundance on its shores. In these passages,  Exodus 10:19 ;  13:18 ;  Exodus 15:4 Exodus 15:22 ;  23:31 ;  Numbers 14:25 , etc., the Hebrew name is always translated "Red Sea," which was the name given to it by the Greeks. The origin of this name (Red Sea) is uncertain. Some think it is derived from the red colour of the mountains on the western shore; others from the red coral found in the sea, or the red appearance sometimes given to the water by certain zoophytes floating in it. In the New Testament ( Acts 7:36 ;  Hebrews 11:29 ) this name is given to the Gulf of Suez.  </p><p> This sea was also called by the Hebrews Yam-mitstraim, i.e., "the Egyptian sea" ( Isaiah 11:15 ), and simply Ha-yam, "the sea" ( Exodus 14:2 Exodus 14:9 Exodus 14:16 Exodus 14:21 Exodus 14:28 ;  Joshua 24:6 Joshua 24:7 ;  Isaiah 10:26 , etc.).  </p><p> The great historical event connected with the Red Sea is the passage of the children of Israel, and the overthrow of the Egyptians, to which there is frequent reference in Scripture ( Exodus 1415 ,15;  Numbers 33:8 ;  Deuteronomy 11:4 ;  Joshua 2:10 ;  Judges 11:16 ;  2 Sam  22:16 ;  Nehemiah 9:9-11 ;  Psalms 66:6 ;  Isaiah 10:26 ;  Acts 7:36 , etc.).  </p>
Red Sea, Passage of	<p>The account of the march of the Israelites through the Red Sea is given in  Exodus 14:22-31 . There has been great diversity of opinion as to the precise place where this occurred. The difficulty of arriving at any definite conclusion on the matter is much increased by the consideration that the head of the Gulf of Suez, which was the branch of the sea that was crossed, must have extended at the time of the Exodus probably 50 miles farther north than it does at present. Some have argued that the crossing took place opposite the Wady Tawarik, where the sea is at present some 7 miles broad. But the opinion that seems to be best supported is that which points to the neighbourhood of Suez. This position perfectly satisfies all the conditions of the stupendous miracle as recorded in the sacred narrative. (See EXODUS .) </p>
Redeemer	<p>Heb. goel; i.e., one charged with the duty of restoring the rights of another and avenging his wrongs ( Leviticus 25:48 Leviticus 25:49 ;  Numbers 5:8 ;  Ruth 4:1 ;  Job 19:25 ;  Psalms 19:14 ;  78:35 , etc.). This title is peculiarly applied to Christ. He redeems us from all evil by the payment of a ransom (q.v.). (See REDEMPTION .) </p>
Redemption	<p>the purchase back of something that had been lost, by the payment of a ransom. The Greek word so rendered is <i> apolutrosis</i> , a word occurring nine times in Scripture, and always with the idea of a ransom or price paid, i.e., redemption by a lutron (see  Matthew 20:28 ;  Mark 10:45 ). There are instances in the LXX. Version of the Old Testament of the use of <i> lutron</i> in man's relation to man ( Leviticus 19:20 ;  25:51 ;  Exodus 21:30 ;  Numbers 35:31 Numbers 35:32 ;  Isaiah 45:13 ;  Proverbs 6:35 ), and in the same sense of man's relation to God ( Numbers 3:49 ;  18:15 ).  </p><p> There are many passages in the New Testament which represent Christ's sufferings under the idea of a ransom or price, and the result thereby secured is a purchase or redemption (Compare  Acts 20:28 ;  1 Corinthians 6:19 1 Corinthians 6:20 ;  Galatians 3:13 ;  Galatians 4:4 Galatians 4:5 ;  Ephesians 1:7 ;  Colossians 1:14 ;  1 Timothy 2:5 1 Timothy 2:6 ;  Titus 2:14 ;  Hebrews 9:12 ;  1 Peter 1:18 1 Peter 1:19 ;  Revelation 5:9 ). The idea running through all these texts, however various their reference, is that of payment made for our redemption. The debt against us is not viewed as simply cancelled, but is fully paid. Christ's blood or life, which he surrendered for them, is the "ransom" by which the deliverance of his people from the servitude of sin and from its penal consequences is secured. It is the plain doctrine of Scripture that "Christ saves us neither by the mere exercise of power, nor by his doctrine, nor by his example, nor by the moral influence which he exerted, nor by any subjective influence on his people, whether natural or mystical, but as a satisfaction to divine justice, as an expiation for sin, and as a ransom from the curse and authority of the law, thus reconciling us to God by making it consistent with his perfection to exercise mercy toward sinners" (Hodge's Systematic Theology).  </p>
Reed	<p></p><li> "Paper reeds" ( Isaiah 19:7 ; RSV, "reeds"). Heb. 'aroth, properly green herbage growing in marshy places.  </li><li> Heb. kaneh ( 1 Kings 14:15 ;  Job 40:21 ;  Isaiah 19:6 ), whence the Gr. kanna, a "cane," a generic name for a reed of any kind.  <p> The reed of Egypt and Palestine is the Arundo donax, which grows to the height of 12 feet, its stalk jointed like the bamboo, "with a magnificent panicle of blossom at the top, and so slender and yielding that it will lie perfectly flat under a gust of wind, and immediately resume its upright position." It is used to illustrate weakness ( 2 Kings 18:21 ;  Ezekiel 29:6 ), also fickleness or instability ( Matthew 11:7 ; Compare  Ephesians 4:14 ).  </p><p> A "bruised reed" ( Isaiah 42:3 ;  Matthew 12:20 ) is an emblem of a believer weak in grace. A reed was put into our Lord's hands in derision ( Matthew 27:29 ); and "they took the reed and smote him on the head" (30). The "reed" on which they put the sponge filled with vinegar ( Matthew 27:48 ) was, according to ( John 19:29 ), a hyssop stalk, which must have been of some length, or perhaps a bunch of hyssop twigs fastened to a rod with the sponge. (See CANE .) </p> </li>
Refiner	<p>The process of refining metals is referred to by way of illustrations in  Isaiah 1:25 ;  Jeremiah 6:29 ;  Zechariah 13:9 ;  Malachi 3:2 Malachi 3:3 .  </p>
Refuge, Cities of	<p>were six in number ( Numbers 35 ). 1. On the west of Jordan were (1) Kadesh, in Naphtali; (2) Shechem, in Mount Ephraim; (3) Hebron, in Judah. 2. On the east of Jordan were, (1) Golan, in Bashan; (2) Ramoth-Gilead, in Gad; and (3) Bezer, in Reuben. (See under each of these names.)  </p>
Regem-melech	<p>friend of the king, one of the two messengers sent by the exiled Jews to Jerusalem in the time of Darius ( Zechariah 7:2 ) to make inquiries at the temple.  </p>
Regeneration	<p>only found in  Matthew 19:28  and  Titus 3:5 . This word literally means a "new birth." The Greek word so rendered (palingenesia) is used by classical writers with reference to the changes produced by the return of spring. In  Matthew 19:28  the word is equivalent to the "restitution of all things" ( Acts 3:21 ). In  Titus 3:5  it denotes that change of heart elsewhere spoken of as a passing from death to life ( 1 John 3:14 ); becoming a new creature in Christ Jesus ( 2 Corinthians 5:17 ); being born again ( John 3:5 ); a renewal of the mind ( Romans 12:2 ); a resurrection from the dead ( Ephesians 2:6 ); a being quickened ( Ephesians 2:1 Ephesians 2:5 ).  </p><p> This change is ascribed to the Holy Spirit. It originates not with man but with God ( John 1:12 John 1:13 ;  1 John 2:29 ;  1 John 5:1 1 John 5:4 ).  </p><p> As to the nature of the change, it consists in the implanting of a new principle or disposition in the soul; the impartation of spiritual life to those who are by nature "dead in trespasses and sins." </p><p> The necessity of such a change is emphatically affirmed in Scripture ( John 3:3 ;  Romans 7:18 ;  8:7-9 ;  1 Corinthians 2:14 ;  Ephesians 2:1 ;  4:21-24 ).  </p>
Rehabiah	<p>enlargement of the Lord, the son of Eliezer, and grandson of Moses ( 1 Chronicles 23:17 ;  24:21 ).  </p>
Rehob	<p>street; broad place. </p><li> The father of Hadadezer, king of Tobah ( 2 Samuel 8:3 2 Samuel 8:12 ).  </li><li> Nehemiah 10:11 .  </li><li> The same, probably, as Beth-rehob ( 2 Samuel 10:6 2 Samuel 10:8 ; Judg.  18:28 ), a place in the north of Palestine ( Numbers 13:21 ). It is now supposed to be represented by the castle of Hunin, south-west of Dan, on the road from Hamath into Coele-Syria.  </li><li> A town of Asher ( Joshua 19:28 ), to the east of Zidon.  </li><li> Another town of Asher ( Joshua 19:30 ), kept possession of by the Canaanites ( Judges 1:31 ).   </li>
Rehoboam	<p>he enlarges the people, the successor of Solomon on the throne, and apparently his only son. He was the son of Naamah "the Ammonitess," some well-known Ammonitish princess ( 1 Kings 14:21 ;  2 Chr  12:13 ). He was forty-one years old when he ascended the throne, and he reigned seventeen years (B.C. 975-958). Although he was acknowledged at once as the rightful heir to the throne, yet there was a strongly-felt desire to modify the character of the government. The burden of taxation to which they had been subjected during Solomon's reign was very oppressive, and therefore the people assembled at Shechem and demanded from the king an alleviation of their burdens. He went to meet them at Shechem, and heard their demands for relief ( 1 Kings 12:4 ). After three days, having consulted with a younger generation of courtiers that had grown up around him, instead of following the advice of elders, he answered the people haughtily (6-15). "The king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the Lord" (comp  11:31 ). This brought matters speedily to a crisis. The terrible cry was heard (Compare  2 Samuel 20:1 ):  </p><p> "What portion have we in David?  Neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse:  To your tents, O Israel:  Now see to thine own house, David" ( 1 Kings 12:16 ).  </p><p> And now at once the kingdom was rent in twain. Rehoboam was appalled, and tried concessions, but it was too late (18). The tribe of Judah, Rehoboam's own tribe, alone remained faithful to him. Benjamin was reckoned along with Judah, and these two tribes formed the southern kingdom, with Jerusalem as its capital; while the northern ten tribes formed themselves into a separate kingdom, choosing Jeroboam as their king. Rehoboam tried to win back the revolted ten tribes by making war against them, but he was prevented by the prophet Shemaiah (21-24;  2 Chronicles 11:1-4 ) from fulfilling his purpose. (See JEROBOAM .) </p><p> In the fifth year of Rehoboam's reign, Shishak (q.v.), one of the kings of Egypt of the Assyrian dynasty, stirred up, no doubt, by Jeroboam his son-in-law, made war against him. Jerusalem submitted to the invader, who plundered the temple and virtually reduced the kingdom to the position of a vassal of Egypt ( 1 Kings 14:25 1 Kings 14:26 ;  2 Chr  12:5-9 ). A remarkable memorial of this invasion has been discovered at Karnac, in Upper Egypt, in certain sculptures on the walls of a small temple there. These sculptures represent the king, Shishak, holding in his hand a train of prisoners and other figures, with the names of the captured towns of Judah, the towns which Rehoboam had fortified ( 2 Chronicles 11:5-12 ).  </p><p> The kingdom of Judah, under Rehoboam, sank more and more in moral and spiritual decay. "There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days." At length, in the fifty-eighth year of his age, Rehoboam "slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David" ( 1 Kings 14:31 ). He was succeeded by his son Abijah. (See EGYPT .) </p>
Rehoboth	<p>broad places. </p><li> A well in Gerar dug by Isaac ( Genesis 26:22 ), supposed to be in Wady er-Ruheibeh, about 20 miles south of Beersheba.  </li><li> An ancient city on the Euphrates ( Genesis 36:37 ;  1 Chronicles 1:48 ), "Rehoboth by the river."  </li><li> Named among the cities of Asshur ( Genesis 10:11 ). Probably, however, the words "rehoboth'ir" are to be translated as in the Vulgate and the margin of A.V., "the streets of the city," or rather "the public square of the city", i.e., of Nineveh.   </li>
Rehum	<p>merciful. </p><li> One of "the children of the province" who returned from the Captivity ( Ezra 2:2 ); the same as "Nehum" ( Nehemiah 7:7 ).  </li><li> The "chancellor" of Artaxerxes, who sought to stir him up against the Jews ( Ezra 4:8-24 ) and prevent the rebuilding of the walls and the temple of Jerusalem.  </li><li> A Levite ( Nehemiah 3:17 ).  </li><li> Nehemiah 10:25 .  </li><li> A priest ( Nehemiah 12:3 ).   </li>
Rei	<p>friendly, one who maintained true allegiance to king David ( 1 Kings 1:8 ) when Adonijah rebelled.  </p>
Reins	<p>the kidneys, the supposed seat of the desires and affections; used metaphorically for "heart." The "reins" and the "heart" are often mentioned together, as denoting the whole moral constitution of man ( Psalms 7:9 ;  16:7 ;  26:2 ;  139:13 ;  Jeremiah 17:10 , etc.).  </p>
Rekem	<p>embroidered; variegated. </p><li> One of the five Midianite kings whom the Israelites destroyed ( Numbers 31:8 ).  </li><li> One of the sons of Hebron ( 1 Chronicles 2:43 1 Chronicles 2:44 ).  </li><li> A town of Benjamin ( Joshua 18:27 ).   </li>
Remaliah	<p>adorned by the Lord, the father of Pekah, who conspired successfully against Pekahiah ( 2 Kings 15:25 2 Kings 15:27 2 Kings 15:30 2 Kings 15:32 2 Kings 15:37 ;  Isaiah 7:1 Isaiah 7:4 Isaiah 7:5 Isaiah 7:9 ;  8:6 ).  </p>
Remeth	<p>another form of Ramah (q.v.) or Ramoth ( 1 Chronicles 6:73 ;  Joshua 19:21 ), and probably also of Jarmuth ( Joshua 21:29 ).  </p>
Remmon-methoar	<p>( Joshua 19:13 ), rendered correctly in the Revised Version, "Rimmon, which stretcheth unto Neah," a landmark of Zebulun; called also Rimmon ( 1 Chronicles 6:77 ).  </p>
Remphan	<p>( Acts 7:43 ; RSV, "Rephan"). In  Amos 5:26  the Heb. Chiun (q.v.) is rendered by the LXX. "Rephan," and this name is adopted by Luke in his narrative of the Acts. These names represent the star-god Saturn or Moloch.  </p>
Sabachthani	<p>thou hast forsaken me, one of the Aramaic words uttered by our Lord on the cross ( Matthew 27:46 ;  Mark 15:34 ).  </p>
Sabaoth	<p>the transliteration of the Hebrew word <i> tsebha'oth</i> , meaning "hosts," "armies" ( Romans 9:29 ;  James 5:4 ). In the LXX. the Hebrew word is rendered by "Almighty." (See   Revelation 4:8 ; Compare  Isaiah 6:3 .) It may designate Jehovah as either (1) God of the armies of earth, or (2) God of the armies of the stars, or (3) God of the unseen armies of angels; or perhaps it may include all these ideas.  </p>
Sabbath	<p>(Heb. verb shabbath, meaning "to rest from labour"), the day of rest. It is first mentioned as having been instituted in Paradise, when man was in innocence ( Genesis 2:2 ). "The sabbath was made for man," as a day of rest and refreshment for the body and of blessing to the soul.  </p><p> It is next referred to in connection with the gift of manna to the children of Israel in the wilderness ( Exodus 16:23 ); and afterwards, when the law was given from Sinai ( 20:11 ), the people were solemnly charged to "remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy." Thus it is spoken of as an institution already existing.  </p><p> In the Mosaic law strict regulations were laid down regarding its observance ( Exodus 35:2 Exodus 35:3 ;  Leviticus 23:3 ;  26:34 ). These were peculiar to that dispensation.  </p><p> In the subsequent history of the Jews frequent references are made to the sanctity of the Sabbath ( Isaiah 56:2 Isaiah 56:4 Isaiah 56:6 Isaiah 56:7 ;  Isaiah 58:13 Isaiah 58:14 ;  Jeremiah 17:20-22 ;  Nehemiah 13:19 ). In later times they perverted the Sabbath by their traditions. Our Lord rescued it from their perversions, and recalled to them its true nature and intent ( Matthew 12:10-13 ;  Mark 2:27 ;  Luke 13:10-17 ).  </p><p> The Sabbath, originally instituted for man at his creation, is of permanent and universal obligation. The physical necessities of man require a Sabbath of rest. He is so constituted that his bodily welfare needs at least one day in seven for rest from ordinary labour. Experience also proves that the moral and spiritual necessities of men also demand a Sabbath of rest. "I am more and more sure by experience that the reason for the observance of the Sabbath lies deep in the everlasting necessities of human nature, and that as long as man is man the blessedness of keeping it, not as a day of rest only, but as a day of spiritual rest, will never be annulled. I certainly do feel by experience the eternal obligation, because of the eternal necessity, of the Sabbath. The soul withers without it. It thrives in proportion to its observance. The Sabbath was made for man. God made it for men in a certain spiritual state because they needed it. The need, therefore, is deeply hidden in human nature. He who can dispense with it must be holy and spiritual indeed. And he who, still unholy and unspiritual, would yet dispense with it is a man that would fain be wiser than his Maker" (F. W. Robertson). </p><p> The ancient Babylonian calendar, as seen from recently recovered inscriptions on the bricks among the ruins of the royal palace, was based on the division of time into weeks of seven days. The Sabbath is in these inscriptions designated Sabattu, and defined as "a day of rest for the heart" and "a day of completion of labour." </p><p> The change of the day. Originally at creation the seventh day of the week was set apart and consecrated as the Sabbath. The first day of the week is now observed as the Sabbath. Has God authorized this change? There is an obvious distinction between the Sabbath as an institution and the particular day set apart for its observance. The question, therefore, as to the change of the day in no way affects the perpetual obligation of the Sabbath as an institution. Change of the day or no change, the Sabbath remains as a sacred institution the same. It cannot be abrogated. </p><p> If any change of the day has been made, it must have been by Christ or by his authority. Christ has a right to make such a change ( Mark 2:23-28 ). As Creator, Christ was the original Lord of the Sabbath ( John 1:3 ;  Hebrews 1:10 ). It was originally a memorial of creation. A work vastly greater than that of creation has now been accomplished by him, the work of redemption. We would naturally expect just such a change as would make the Sabbath a memorial of that greater work.  </p><p> True, we can give no text authorizing the change in so many words. We have no express law declaring the change. But there are evidences of another kind. We know for a fact that the first day of the week has been observed from apostolic times, and the necessary conclusion is, that it was observed by the apostles and their immediate disciples. This, we may be sure, they never would have done without the permission or the authority of their Lord. </p><p> After his resurrection, which took place on the first day of the week ( Matthew 28:1 ;  Mark 16:2 ;  Luke 24:1 ;  John 20:1 ), we never find Christ meeting with his disciples on the seventh day. But he specially honoured the first day by manifesting himself to them on four separate occasions ( Matthew 28:9 ;  Luke 24:34 Luke 24:18-33 ;  John 20:19-23 ). Again, on the next first day of the week, Jesus appeared to his disciples ( John 20:26 ).  </p><p> Some have calculated that Christ's ascension took place on the first day of the week. And there can be no doubt that the descent of the Holy Ghost at Pentecost was on that day ( Acts 2:1 ). Thus Christ appears as instituting a new day to be observed by his people as the Sabbath, a day to be henceforth known amongst them as the "Lord's day." The observance of this "Lord's day" as the Sabbath was the general custom of the primitive churches, and must have had apostolic sanction (Compare  Acts 20:3-7 ;  1 Corinthians 16:1 1 Corinthians 16:2 ) and authority, and so the sanction and authority of Jesus Christ.  </p><p> The words "at her sabbaths" ( Lamentations 1:7 , A.V.) ought probably to be, as in the Revised Version, "at her desolations."  </p>
Sabbath days journey	<p>supposed to be a distance of 2,000 cubits, or less than half-a-mile, the distance to which, according to Jewish tradition, it was allowable to travel on the Sabbath day without violating the law ( Acts 1:12 ; Compare  Exodus 16:29 ;  Numbers 35:5 ;  Joshua 3:4 ).  </p>
Sabbatical year	<p>every seventh year, during which the land, according to the law of Moses, had to remain uncultivated ( Leviticus 25:2-7 ; Compare  Exodus 23:10 Exodus 23:11 Exodus 23:12 ;  Leviticus 26:34 Leviticus 26:35 ). Whatever grew of itself during that year was not for the owner of the land, but for the poor and the stranger and the beasts of the field. All debts, except those of foreigners, were to be remitted ( Deuteronomy 15:1-11 ). There is little notice of the observance of this year in Biblical history. It appears to have been much neglected ( 2 Chronicles 36:20 2 Chronicles 36:21 ).  </p>
Sabeans	<p>descendants of Seba ( Genesis 10:7 ); Africans ( Isaiah 43:3 ). They were "men of stature," and engaged in merchandise ( Isaiah 45:14 ). Their conversion to the Lord was predicted ( Psalms 72:10 ). This word, in  Ezekiel 23:42 , should be read, as in the margin of the Authorized Version, and in the Revised Version, "drunkards." Another tribe, apparently given to war, is mentioned in  Job 1:15 .  </p>
Sabtah	<p>rest, the third son of Cush ( Genesis 10:7 ;  1 Chronicles 1:9 ).  </p>
Sabtecha	<p>the fifth son of Cush (id.). </p>
Sachar	<p>hire. </p><li> One of David's heroes ( 1 Chronicles 11:35 ); called also Sharar ( 2 Samuel 23:33 ).  </li><li> A son of Obed-edom the Gittite, and a temple porter ( 1 Chronicles 26:4 ).   </li>
Sackbut	<p>(Chald. sabkha; Gr. sambuke), a Syrian stringed instrument resembling a harp ( Daniel 3:5 Daniel 3:7 Daniel 3:10 Daniel 3:15 ); not the modern sackbut, which is a wind instrument.  </p>
Sackcloth	<p>cloth made of black goats' hair, coarse, rough, and thick, used for sacks, and also worn by mourners ( Genesis 37:34 ;  42:25 ;  2 Sam.  3:31 ;  Esther 4:1 Esther 4:2 ;  Psalms 30:11 , etc.), and as a sign of repentance ( Matthew 11:21 ). It was put upon animals by the people of Nineveh ( Jonah 3:8 ).  </p>
Sacrifice	<p>The offering up of sacrifices is to be regarded as a divine institution. It did not originate with man. God himself appointed it as the mode in which acceptable worship was to be offered to him by guilty man. The language and the idea of sacrifice pervade the whole Bible. </p><p> Sacrifices were offered in the ante-diluvian age. The Lord clothed Adam and Eve with the skins of animals, which in all probability had been offered in sacrifice ( Genesis 3:21 ). Abel offered a sacrifice "of the firstlings of his flock" ( 4:4 ;  Hebrews 11:4 ). A distinction also was made between clean and unclean animals, which there is every reason to believe had reference to the offering up of sacrifices ( Genesis 7:2 Genesis 7:8 ), because animals were not given to man as food till after the Flood.  </p><p> The same practice is continued down through the patriarchal age ( Genesis 8:20 ;  12:7 ;  Genesis 13:4 Genesis 13:18 ;  15:9-11 ;  22:1-18 , etc.). In the Mosaic period of Old Testament history definite laws were prescribed by God regarding the different kinds of sacrifices that were to be offered and the manner in which the offering was to be made. The offering of stated sacrifices became indeed a prominent and distinctive feature of the whole period ( Exodus 12:3-27 ;  Leviticus 23:5-8 ;  Numbers 9:2-14 ). (See ALTAR .) </p><p> We learn from the Epistle to the Hebrews that sacrifices had in themselves no value or efficacy. They were only the "shadow of good things to come," and pointed the worshippers forward to the coming of the great High Priest, who, in the fullness of the time, "was offered once for all to bear the sin of many." Sacrifices belonged to a temporary economy, to a system of types and emblems which served their purposes and have now passed away. The "one sacrifice for sins" hath "perfected for ever them that are sanctified." </p><p> Sacrifices were of two kinds: 1. Unbloody, such as (1) first-fruits and tithes; (2) meat and drink-offerings; and (3) incense. 2. Bloody, such as (1) burnt-offerings; (2) peace-offerings; and (3) sin and trespass offerings. (See OFFERINGS .) </p>
Sadducees	<p>The origin of this Jewish sect cannot definitely be traced. It was probably the outcome of the influence of Grecian customs and philosophy during the period of Greek domination. The first time they are met with is in connection with John the Baptist's ministry. They came out to him when on the banks of the Jordan, and he said to them, "O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?" ( Matthew 3:7 .) The next time they are spoken of they are represented as coming to our Lord tempting him. He calls them "hypocrites" and "a wicked and adulterous generation" ( Matthew 16:1-4 ;  22:23 ). The only reference to them in the Gospels of ( Mark 12:18-27 ) and ( Luke 20:27-38 ) is their attempting to ridicule the doctrine of the resurrection, which they denied, as they also denied the existence of angels. They are never mentioned in John's Gospel.  </p><p> There were many Sadducees among the "elders" of the Sanhedrin. They seem, indeed, to have been as numerous as the Pharisees ( Acts 23:6 ). They showed their hatred of Jesus in taking part in his condemnation ( Matthew 16:21 ;  Matthew 26:1-3 Matthew 26:59 ;  Mark 8:31 ;  15:1 ;  Luke 9:22 ;  22:66 ). They endeavoured to prohibit the apostles from preaching the resurrection of Christ ( Acts 2:24 Acts 2:31 Acts 2:32 ;  Acts 4:1 Acts 4:2 ;  Acts 5:17 Acts 5:24-28 ). They were the deists or sceptics of that age. They do not appear as a separate sect after the destruction of Jerusalem.  </p>
Sadoc	<p>just, mentioned in the genealogy of our Lord ( Matthew 1:14 ).  </p>
Saffron	<p>Heb. karkom, Arab. zafran (i.e., "yellow"), mentioned only in Cant  Matthew 4:13 Matthew 4:14 ; the Crocus sativus. Many species of the crocus are found in Palestine. The pistils and stigmata, from the centre of its flowers, are pressed into "saffron cakes," common in the East. "We found," says Tristram, "saffron a very useful condiment in travelling cookery, a very small pinch of it giving not only a rich yellow colour but an agreable flavour to a dish of rice or to an insipid stew."  </p>
Saint	<p>one separated from the world and consecrated to God; one holy by profession and by covenant; a believer in Christ ( Psalms 16:3 ;  Romans 1:7 ;  8:27 ; Phil  1:1 ;  Hebrews 6:10 ).  </p><p> The "saints" spoken of in  Jude 1:14  are probably not the disciples of Christ, but the "innumerable company of angels" ( Hebrews 12:22 ;  Psalms 68:17 ), with reference to  Deuteronomy 33:2 .  </p><p> This word is also used of the holy dead ( Matthew 27:52 ;  Revelation 18:24 ). It was not used as a distinctive title of the apostles and evangelists and of a "spiritual nobility" till the fourth century. In that sense it is not a scriptural title.  </p>
Sala	<p>a shoot, a descendant of Arphaxed ( Luke 3:35 Luke 3:36 ); called also Shelah ( 1 Chronicles 1:18 1 Chronicles 1:24 ).  </p>
Salamis	<p>a city on the south-east coast of Cyprus ( Acts 13:5 ), where Saul and Barnabas, on their first missionary journey, preached the word in one of the Jewish synagogues, of which there seem to have been several in that place. It is now called Famagusta.  </p>
Salathiel	<p>whom I asked of God, the son of Jeconiah ( Matthew 1:12 ;  1 Chronicles 3:17 ); also called the son of Neri ( Luke 3:27 ). The probable explanation of the apparent discrepancy is that he was the son of Neri, the descendant of Nathan, and thus heir to the throne of David on the death of Jeconiah (Compare  Jeremiah 22:30 ).  </p>
Salcah	<p>wandering, a city of Bashan assigned to the half tribe of Manasseh ( Deuteronomy 3:10 ;  Joshua 12:5 ;  13:11 ), identified with Salkhad, about 56 miles east of Jordan.  </p>
Salem	<p>peace, commonly supposed to be another name of Jerusalem ( Genesis 14:18 ;  Psalms 76:2 ;  Hebrews 7:1 Hebrews 7:2 ).  </p>
Salim	<p>peaceful, a place near AEnon (q.v.), on the west of Jordan, where John baptized ( John 3:23 ). It was probably the Shalem mentioned in  Genesis 33:18 , about 7 miles south of AEnon, at the head of the great Wady Far'ah, which formed the northern boundary of Judea in the Jordan valley.  </p>
Sallai	<p>basket-maker. </p><li> A Benjamite ( Nehemiah 11:8 ).  </li><li> A priest in the days of Joshua and Zerubbabel ( Nehemiah 12:20 ).   </li>
Sallu	<p>weighed. </p><li> A priest ( Nehemiah 12:7 ).  </li><li> A Benjamite ( 1 Chronicles 9:7 ;  Nehemiah 11:7 ).   </li>
Salmon	<p>garment, the son of Nashon ( Ruth 4:20 ;  Matthew 1:4 Matthew 1:5 ), possibly the same as Salma in  1 Chronicles 2:51 .  </p>
Salmon	<p>shady; or Zalmon (q.v.), a hill covered with dark forests, south of Shechem, from which Abimelech and his men gathered wood to burn that city ( Judges 9:48 ). In  Psalms 68:14  the change from war to peace is likened to snow on the dark mountain, as some interpret the expression. Others suppose the words here mean that the bones of the slain left unburied covered the land, so that it seemed to be white as if covered with snow. The reference, however, of the psalm is probably to  Joshua 11  and 12. The scattering of the kings and their followers is fitly likened unto the snow-flakes rapidly falling on the dark Salmon. It is the modern Jebel Suleiman.  </p>
Salmone	<p>a promontory on the east of Crete, under which Paul sailed on his voyage to Rome ( Acts 27:7 ); the modern Cape Sidero.  </p>
Salome	<p>perfect. </p><li> The wife of Zebedee and mother of James and John (Mat  27:56 ), and probably the sister of Mary, the mother of our Lord ( John 19:25 ). She sought for her sons places of honour in Christ's kingdom ( Matthew 20:20 Matthew 20:21 ; comp  19:28 ). She witnessed the crucifixion ( Mark 15:40 ), and was present with the other women at the sepulchre ( Matthew 27:56 ).  </li><li> "The daughter of Herodias," not named in the New Testament. On the occasion of the birthday festival held by Herod Antipas, who had married her mother Herodias, in the fortress of Machaerus, she "came in and danced, and pleased Herod" ( Mark 6:14-29 ). John the Baptist, at that time a prisoner in the dungeons underneath the castle, was at her request beheaded by order of Herod, and his head given to the damsel in a charger, "and the damsel gave it to her mother," whose revengeful spirit was thus gratified. "A luxurious feast of the period" (says Farrar, Life of Christ) "was not regarded as complete unless it closed with some gross pantomimic representation; and doubtless Herod had adopted the evil fashion of his day. But he had not anticipated for his guests the rare luxury of seeing a princess, his own niece, a grand-daughter of Herod the Great and of Mariamne, a descendant, therefore, of Simon the high priest and the great line of Maccabean princes, a princess who afterwards became the wife of a tetrarch [Philip, tetrarch of Trachonitis] and the mother of a king, honouring them by degrading herself into a scenic dancer."   </li>
Salt	<p>used to season food ( Job 6:6 ), and mixed with the fodder of cattle ( Isaiah 30:24 , "clean;" in marg. of RSV "salted"). All meat-offerings were seasoned with salt ( Leviticus 2:13 ). To eat salt with one is to partake of his hospitality, to derive subsistence from him; and hence he who did so was bound to look after his host's interests ( Ezra 4:14 , "We have maintenance from the king's palace;" A.V. marg., "We are salted with the salt of the palace;" RSV, "We eat the salt of the palace").  </p><p> A "covenant of salt" ( Numbers 18:19 ;  2 Chr  13:5 ) was a covenant of perpetual obligation. New-born children were rubbed with salt ( Ezekiel 16:4 ). Disciples are likened unto salt, with reference to its cleansing and preserving uses ( Matthew 5:13 ). When Abimelech took the city of Shechem, he sowed the place with salt, that it might always remain a barren soil ( Judges 9:45 ). Sir Lyon Playfair argues, on scientific grounds, that under the generic name of "salt," in certain passages, we are to understand petroleum or its residue asphalt. Thus in  Genesis 19:26  he would read "pillar of asphalt;" and in  Matthew 5:13 , instead of "salt," "petroleum," which loses its essence by exposure, as salt does not, and becomes asphalt, with which pavements were made.  </p><p> The Jebel Usdum, to the south of the Dead Sea, is a mountain of rock salt about 7 miles long and from 2 to 3 miles wide and some hundreds of feet high.  </p>
Salt Sea	<p>( Joshua 3:16 ). See DEAD  SEA . </p>
Salt, The city of	<p>one of the cities of Judah ( Joshua 15:62 ), probably in the Valley of Salt, at the southern end of the Dead Sea.  </p>
Salt, Valley of	<p>a place where it is said David smote the Syrians ( 2 Samuel 8:13 ). This valley (the' Arabah) is between Judah and Edom on the south of the Dead Sea. Hence some interpreters would insert the words, "and he smote Edom," after the words, "Syrians" in the above text. It is conjectured that while David was leading his army against the Ammonites and Syrians, the Edomites invaded the south of Judah, and that David sent Joab or Abishai against them, who drove them back and finally subdued Edom. (Compare title to  Psalms 60 .)  </p><p> Here also Amaziah "slew of Edom ten thousand men" ( 2 Kings 14:7 ; comp  8: :  2022 -22 and  2 Chronicles 25:5-11 ).  </p>
Salutation	<p>"Eastern modes of salutation are not unfrequently so prolonged as to become wearisome and a positive waste of time. The profusely polite Arab asks so many questions after your health, your happiness, your welfare, your house, and other things, that a person ignorant of the habits of the country would imagine there must be some secret ailment or mysterious sorrow oppressing you, which you wished to conceal, so as to spare the feelings of a dear, sympathizing friend, but which he, in the depth of his anxiety, would desire to hear of. I have often listened to these prolonged salutations in the house, the street, and the highway, and not unfrequently I have experienced their tedious monotony, and I have bitterly lamented useless waste of time" (Porter, Through Samaria, etc.). The work on which the disciples were sent forth was one of urgency, which left no time for empty compliments and prolonged greetings ( Luke 10:4 ).  </p>
Salvation	<p>This word is used of the deliverance of the Israelites from the Egyptians ( Exodus 14:13 ), and of deliverance generally from evil or danger. In the New Testament it is specially used with reference to the great deliverance from the guilt and the pollution of sin wrought out by Jesus Christ, "the great salvation" ( Hebrews 2:3 ). (See REDEMPTION;  REGENERATION .) </p>
Samaria	<p>a watch-mountain or a watch-tower. In the heart of the mountains of Israel, a few miles north-west of Shechem, stands the "hill of Shomeron," a solitary mountain, a great "mamelon." It is an oblong hill, with steep but not inaccessible sides, and a long flat top. Omri, the king of Israel, purchased this hill from Shemer its owner for two talents of silver, and built on its broad summit the city to which he gave the name of "Shomeron", i.e., Samaria, as the new capital of his kingdom instead of Tirzah ( 1 Kings 16:24 ). As such it possessed many advantages. Here Omri resided during the last six years of his reign. As the result of an unsuccessful war with Syria, he appears to have been obliged to grant to the Syrians the right to "make streets in Samaria", i.e., probably permission to the Syrian merchants to carry on their trade in the Israelite capital. This would imply the existence of a considerable Syrian population. "It was the only great city of Palestine created by the sovereign. All the others had been already consecrated by patriarchal tradition or previous possession. But Samaria was the choice of Omri alone. He, indeed, gave to the city which he had built the name of its former owner, but its especial connection with himself as its founder is proved by the designation which it seems Samaria bears in Assyrian inscriptions, Beth-khumri ('the house or palace of Omri').", Stanley.  </p><p> Samaria was frequently besieged. In the days of Ahab, Benhadad II. came up against it with thirty-two vassal kings, but was defeated with a great slaughter ( 1 Kings 20:1-21 ). A second time, next year, he assailed it; but was again utterly routed, and was compelled to surrender to Ahab ( 20:28-34 ), whose army, as compared with that of Benhadad, was no more than "two little flocks of kids."  </p><p> In the days of Jehoram this Benhadad again laid siege to Samaria, during which the city was reduced to the direst extremities. But just when success seemed to be within their reach, they suddenly broke up the seige, alarmed by a mysterious noise of chariots and horses and a great army, and fled, leaving their camp with all its contents behind them. The famishing inhabitants of the city were soon relieved with the abundance of the spoil of the Syrian camp; and it came to pass, according to the word of Elisha, that "a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barely for a shekel, in the gates of Samaria" ( 2 Kings 7:1-20 ).  </p><p> Shalmaneser invaded Israel in the days of Hoshea, and reduced it to vassalage. He laid siege to Samaria (B.C. 723), which held out for three years, and was at length captured by Sargon, who completed the conquest Shalmaneser had begun ( 2 Kings 18:9-12 ;  17:3 ), and removed vast numbers of the tribes into captivity. (See SARGON .) </p><p> This city, after passing through various vicissitudes, was given by the emperor Augustus to Herod the Great, who rebuilt it, and called it Sebaste (Gr. form of Augustus) in honour of the emperor. In the New Testament the only mention of it is in  Acts 8:5-14 , where it is recorded that Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached there.  </p><p> It is now represented by the hamlet of Sebustieh, containing about three hundred inhabitants. The ruins of the ancient town are all scattered over the hill, down the sides of which they have rolled. The shafts of about one hundred of what must have been grand Corinthian columns are still standing, and attract much attention, although nothing definite is known regarding them. (Compare  Micah 1:6 .)  </p><p> In the time of Christ, Western Palestine was divided into three provinces, Judea, Samaria, and Galilee. Samaria occupied the centre of Palestine ( John 4:4 ). It is called in the Talmud the "land of the Cuthim," and is not regarded as a part of the Holy Land at all.  </p><p> It may be noticed that the distance between Samaria and Jerusalem, the respective capitals of the two kingdoms, is only 35 miles in a direct line.  </p>
Samaritan Pentateuch	<p>On the return from the Exile, the Jews refused the Samaritans participation with them in the worship at Jerusalem, and the latter separated from all fellowship with them, and built a temple for themselves on Mount Gerizim. This temple was razed to the ground more than one hundred years B.C. Then a system of worship was instituted similar to that of the temple at Jerusalem. It was founded on the Law, copies of which had been multiplied in Israel as well as in Judah. Thus the Pentateuch was preserved among the Samaritans, although they never called it by this name, but always "the Law," which they read as one book. The division into five books, as we now have it, however, was adopted by the Samaritans, as it was by the Jews, in all their priests' copies of "the Law," for the sake of convenience. This was the only portion of the Old Testament which was accepted by the Samaritans as of divine authority. </p><p> The form of the letters in the manuscript copies of the Samaritan Pentateuch is different from that of the Hebrew copies, and is probably the same as that which was in general use before the Captivity. There are other peculiarities in the writing which need not here be specified. </p><p> There are important differences between the Hebrew and the Samaritan copies of the Pentateuch in the readings of many sentences. In about two thousand instances in which the Samaritan and the Jewish texts differ, the LXX. agrees with the former. The New Testament also, when quoting from the Old Testament, agrees as a rule with the Samaritan text, where that differs from the Jewish. Thus  Exodus 12:40  in the Samaritan reads, "Now the sojourning of the children of Israel and of their fathers which they had dwelt in the land of Canaan and in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years" (Compare  Galatians 3:17 ). It may be noted that the LXX. has the same reading of this text.  </p>
Samaritans	<p>the name given to the new and mixed inhabitants whom Esarhaddon (B.C. 677), the king of Assyria, brought from Babylon and other places and settled in the cities of Samaria, instead of the original inhabitants whom Sargon (B.C. 721) had removed into captivity ( 2 Kings 17:24 ; Compare  Ezra 4:2 Ezra 4:9 Ezra 4:10 ). These strangers (Compare  Luke 17:18 ) amalgamated with the Jews still remaining in the land, and gradually abandoned their old idolatry and adopted partly the Jewish religion.  </p><p> After the return from the Captivity, the Jews in Jerusalem refused to allow them to take part with them in rebuilding the temple, and hence sprang up an open enmity between them. They erected a rival temple on Mount Gerizim, which was, however, destroyed by a Jewish king (B.C. 130). They then built another at Shechem. The bitter enmity between the Jews and Samaritans continued in the time of our Lord: the Jews had "no dealings with the Samaritans" ( John 4:9 ; Compare  Luke 9:52 Luke 9:53 ). Our Lord was in contempt called "a Samaritan" ( John 8:48 ). Many of the Samaritans early embraced the gospel ( John 4:5-42 ;  Acts 8:25 ;  9:31 ;  15:3 ). Of these Samaritans there still remains a small population of about one hundred and sixty, who all reside in Shechem, where they carefully observe the religious customs of their fathers. They are the "smallest and oldest sect in the world."  </p>
Samgar-nebo	<p>be gracious, O Nebo! or a cup-bearer of Nebo, probably the title of Nergal-sharezer, one of the princes of Babylon ( Jeremiah 39:3 ).  </p>
Samos	<p>an island in the AEgean Sea, which Paul passed on his voyage from Assos to Miletus ( Acts 20:15 ), on his third missionary journey. It is about 27 miles long and 20 broad, and lies about 42 miles south-west of Smyrna.  </p>
Samothracia	<p>an island in the AEgean Sea, off the coast of Thracia, about 32 miles distant. This Thracian Samos was passed by Paul on his voyage from Troas to Neapolis ( Acts 16:11 ) on his first missionary journey. It is about 8 miles long and 6 miles broad. Its modern name is Samothraki.  </p>
Samson	<p>of the sun, the son of Manoah, born at Zorah. The narrative of his life is given in Judg. 13-16. He was a "Nazarite unto God" from his birth, the first Nazarite mentioned in Scripture (Judg.  13:3-5 ; Compare  Numbers 6:1-21 ). The first recorded event of his life was his marriage with a Philistine woman of Timnath (Judg.  14:1-5 ). Such a marriage was not forbidden by the law of Moses, as the Philistines did not form one of the seven doomed Canaanite nations ( Exodus 34:11-16 ;  Deuteronomy 7:1-4 ). It was, however, an ill-assorted and unblessed marriage. His wife was soon taken from him and given "to his companion" ( Judges 14:20 ). For this Samson took revenge by burning the "standing corn of the Philistines" ( 15:1-8 ), who, in their turn, in revenge "burnt her and her father with fire." Her death he terribly avenged ( 15:7-19 ). During the twenty years following this he judged Israel; but we have no record of his life. Probably these twenty years may have been simultaneous with the last twenty years of Eli's life. After this we have an account of his exploits at Gaza ( 16:1-3 ), and of his infatuation for Delilah, and her treachery ( 16:4-20 ), and then of his melancholy death ( 16:21-31 ). He perished in the last terrible destruction he brought upon his enemies. "So the dead which he slew at his death were more [in social and political importance=the elite of the people] than they which he slew in his life."  </p><p> "Straining all his nerves, he bowed:  As with the force of winds and waters pent,  When mountains tremble, those two massy pillars  With horrible convulsion to and fro  He tugged, he shook, till down they came, and drew  The whole roof after them, with burst of thunder  Upon the heads of all who sat beneath,  Lords, ladies, captains, counsellors, or priests,  Their choice nobility and flower."  Milton's Samson Agonistes. </p>
Samuel	<p>heard of God. The peculiar circumstances connected with his birth are recorded in  1 Samuel 1:20 . Hannah, one of the two wives of Elkanah, who came up to Shiloh to worship before the Lord, earnestly prayed to God that she might become the mother of a son. Her prayer was graciously granted; and after the child was weaned she brought him to Shiloh nd consecrated him to the Lord as a perpetual Nazarite ( (1:23-2:11). ). Here his bodily wants and training were attended to by the women who served in the tabernacle, while Eli cared for his religious culture. Thus, probably, twelve years of his life passed away. "The child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the Lord, and also with men" ( 2:26 ; Compare  Luke 2:52 ). It was a time of great and growing degeneracy in Israel ( Judges 21:19-21 ;  1 Samuel 2:12-17 1 Samuel 2:22 ). The Philistines, who of late had greatly increased in number and in power, were practically masters of the country, and kept the people in subjection ( 1 Samuel 10:5 ;  13:3 ).  </p><p> At this time new communications from God began to be made to the pious child. A mysterious voice came to him in the night season, calling him by name, and, instructed by Eli, he answered, "Speak, Lord; for thy servant heareth." The message that came from the Lord was one of woe and ruin to Eli and his profligate sons. Samuel told it all to Eli, whose only answer to the terrible denunciations ( 1 Samuel 3:11-18 ) was, "It is the Lord; let him do what seemeth him good", the passive submission of a weak character, not, in his case, the expression of the highest trust and faith. The Lord revealed himself now in divers manners to Samuel, and his fame and his influence increased throughout the land as of one divinely called to the prophetical office. A new period in the history of the kingdom of God now commenced.  </p><p> The Philistine yoke was heavy, and the people, groaning under the wide-spread oppression, suddenly rose in revolt, and "went out against the Philistines to battle." A fierce and disastrous battle was fought at Aphek, near to Ebenezer ( 1 Samuel 4:1 1 Samuel 4:2 ). The Israelites were defeated, leaving 4,000 dead "in the field." The chiefs of the people thought to repair this great disaster by carrying with them the ark of the covenant as the symbol of Jehovah's presence. They accordingly, without consulting Samuel, fetched it out of Shiloh to the camp near Aphek. At the sight of the ark among them the people "shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again." A second battle was fought, and again the Philistines defeated the Israelites, stormed their camp, slew 30,000 men, and took the sacred ark. The tidings of this fatal battle was speedily conveyed to Shiloh; and so soon as the aged Eli heard that the ark of God was taken, he fell backward from his seat at the entrance of the sanctuary, and his neck brake, and he died. The tabernacle with its furniture was probably, by the advice of Samuel, now about twenty years of age, removed from Shiloh to some place of safety, and finally to Nob, where it remained many years ( 21:1 ).  </p><p> The Philistines followed up their advantage, and marched upon Shiloh, which they plundered and destroyed (Compare  Jeremiah 7:12 ;  Psalms 78:59 ). This was a great epoch in the history of Israel. For twenty years after this fatal battle at Aphek the whole land lay under the oppression of the Philistines. During all these dreary years Samuel was a spiritual power in the land. From Ramah, his native place, where he resided, his influence went forth on every side among the people. With unwearied zeal he went up and down from place to place, reproving, rebuking, and exhorting the people, endeavouring to awaken in them a sense of their sinfulness, and to lead them to repentance. His labours were so far successful that "all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord." Samuel summoned the people to Mizpeh, one of the loftiest hills in Central Palestine, where they fasted and prayed, and prepared themselves there, under his direction, for a great war against the Philistines, who now marched their whole force toward Mizpeh, in order to crush the Israelites once for all. At the intercession of Samuel God interposed in behalf of Israel. Samuel himself was their leader, the only occasion in which he acted as a leader in war. The Philistines were utterly routed. They fled in terror before the army of Israel, and a great slaughter ensued. This battle, fought probably about B.C. 1095, put an end to the forty years of Philistine oppression. In memory of this great deliverance, and in token of gratitude for the help vouchsafed, Samuel set up a great stone in the battlefield, and called it "Ebenezer," saying, "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us" ( 1 Samuel 7:1-12 ). This was the spot where, twenty years before, the Israelites had suffered a great defeat, when the ark of God was taken.  </p><p> This victory over the Philistines was followed by a long period of peace for Israel ( 1 Samuel 7:13 1 Samuel 7:14 ), during which Samuel exercised the functions of judge, going "from year to year in circuit" from his home in Ramah to Bethel, thence to Gilgal (not that in the Jordan valley, but that which lay to the west of Ebal and Gerizim), and returning by Mizpeh to Ramah. He established regular services at Shiloh, where he built an altar; and at Ramah he gathered a company of young men around him and established a school of the prophets. The schools of the prophets, thus originated, and afterwards established also at Gibeah, Bethel, Gilgal, and Jericho, exercised an important influence on the national character and history of the people in maintaining pure religion in the midst of growing corruption. They continued to the end of the Jewish commonwealth.  </p><p> Many years now passed, during which Samuel exercised the functions of his judicial office, being the friend and counsellor of the people in all matters of private and public interest. He was a great statesman as well as a reformer, and all regarded him with veneration as the "seer," the prophet of the Lord. At the close of this period, when he was now an old man, the elders of Israel came to him at Ramah ( 1 Samuel 8:4 1 Samuel 8:5 1 Samuel 8:19-22 ); and feeling how great was the danger to which the nation was exposed from the misconduct of Samuel's sons, whom he had invested with judicial functions as his assistants, and had placed at Beersheba on the Philistine border, and also from a threatened invasion of the Ammonites, they demanded that a king should be set over them. This request was very displeasing to Samuel. He remonstrated with them, and warned them of the consequences of such a step. At length, however, referring the matter to God, he acceded to their desires, and anointed Saul (q.v.) to be their king ( 11:15 ). Before retiring from public life he convened an assembly of the people at Gilgal (ch. 12), and there solemnly addressed them with reference to his own relation to them as judge and prophet.  </p><p> The remainder of his life he spent in retirement at Ramah, only occasionally and in special circumstances appearing again in public ( <span class="badLink">1 Samuel 1315</span> ,15) with communications from God to king Saul. While mourning over the many evils which now fell upon the nation, he is suddenly summoned (ch.16) to go to Bethlehem and anoint David, the son of Jesse, as king over Israel instead of Saul. After this little is known of him till the time of his death, which took place at Ramah when he was probably about eighty years of age. "And all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah" ( 25:1 ), not in the house itself, but in the court or garden of his house. (Compare  2 Kings 21:18 ;  2 Chr  33:20 ;  1 Kings 2:34 ;  John 19:41 .)  </p><p> Samuel's devotion to God, and the special favour with which God regarded him, are referred to in  Jeremiah 15:1  and  Psalms 99:6 .  </p>
Samuel, Books of	<p>The LXX. translators regarded the books of Samuel and of Kings as forming one continuous history, which they divided into four books, which they called "Books of the Kingdom." The Vulgate version followed this division, but styled them "Books of the Kings." These books of Samuel they accordingly called the "First" and "Second" Books of Kings, and not, as in the modern Protestant versions, the "First" and "Second" Books of Samuel. </p><p> The authors of the books of Samuel were probably Samuel, Gad, and Nathan. Samuel penned the first twenty-four chapters of the first book. Gad, the companion of David ( 1 Samuel 22:5 ), continued the history thus commenced; and Nathan completed it, probably arranging the whole in the form in which we now have it ( 1 Chronicles 29:29 ).  </p><p> The contents of the books. The first book comprises a period of about a hundred years, and nearly coincides with the life of Samuel. It contains (1) the history of Eli (1-4); (2) the history of Samuel (5-12); (3) the history of Saul, and of David in exile (13-31). The second book, comprising a period of perhaps fifty years, contains a history of the reign of David (1) over Judah (1-4), and (2) over all Israel (5-24), mainly in its political aspects. The last four chapters of Second Samuel may be regarded as a sort of appendix recording various events, but not chronologically. These books do not contain complete histories. Frequent gaps are met with in the record, because their object is to present a history of the kingdom of God in its gradual development, and not of the events of the reigns of the successive rulers. It is noticeable that the section ( 2 Samuel 11:2-12 :  <span class="badLink">29</span> ) containing an account of David's sin in the matter of Bathsheba is omitted in the corresponding passage in  1 Chronicles 20 .  </p>
Sanballat	<p>held some place of authority in Samaria when Nehemiah went up to Jerusalem to rebuild its ruined walls. He vainly attempted to hinder this work ( Nehemiah 2:10 Nehemiah 2:19 ;  4:1-12 ;  6 ). His daughter became the wife of one of the sons of Joiada, a son of the high priest, much to the grief of ( Nehemiah 13:28 ).  </p>
Sanctification	<p>involves more than a mere moral reformation of character, brought about by the power of the truth: it is the work of the Holy Spirit bringing the whole nature more and more under the influences of the new gracious principles implanted in the soul in regeneration. In other words, sanctification is the carrying on to perfection the work begun in regeneration, and it extends to the whole man ( Romans 6:13 ;  2 co  4:6 ;  Colossians 3:10 ;  1 John 4:7 ;  1 Corinthians 6:19 ). It is the special office of the Holy Spirit in the plan of redemption to carry on this work ( 1 Corinthians 6:11 ;  2 th.  2:13 ). Faith is instrumental in securing sanctification, inasmuch as it (1) secures union to Christ ( Galatians 2:20 ), and (2) brings the believer into living contact with the truth, whereby he is led to yield obedience "to the commands, trembling at the threatenings, and embracing the promises of God for this life and that which is to come."  </p><p> Perfect sanctification is not attainable in this life ( 1 Kings 8:46 ;  Proverbs 20:9 ; Eccl  7:20 ;  James 3:2 ;  1 John 1:8 ). See Paul's account of himself in  Romans 7:14-25 ; Phil  3:12-14 ; and  1 Timothy 1:15 ; also the confessions of David ( Psalms 19:12 Psalms 19:13 ;  51 ), of Moses ( 90:8 ), of ( Job 42:5 Job 42:6 ), and of ( Daniel 9:3-20 ). "The more holy a man is, the more humble, self-renouncing, self-abhorring, and the more sensitive to every sin he becomes, and the more closely he clings to Christ. The moral imperfections which cling to him he feels to be sins, which he laments and strives to overcome. Believers find that their life is a constant warfare, and they need to take the kingdom of heaven by storm, and watch while they pray. They are always subject to the constant chastisement of their Father's loving hand, which can only be designed to correct their imperfections and to confirm their graces. And it has been notoriously the fact that the best Christians have been those who have been the least prone to claim the attainment of perfection for themselves.", Hodge's Outlines.  </p>
Sanctuary	<p>denotes, (1) the Holy Land ( Exodus 15:17 ; Compare  Psalms 114:2 ); (2) the temple ( 1 Chronicles 22:19 ;  2 Chr  29:21 ); (3) the tabernacle ( Exodus 25:8 ;  Leviticus 12:4 ;  21:12 ); (4) the holy place, the place of the Presence (Gr. hieron, the temple-house; not the <i> naos</i> , which is the temple area, with its courts and porches),  Leviticus 4:6 ;  Ephesians 2:21 , RSV, marg.; (5) God's holy habitation in heaven ( Psalms 102:19 ). In the final state there is properly "no sanctuary" ( Revelation 21:22 ), for God and the Lamb "are the sanctuary" (RSV, "temple"). All is there hallowed by the Divine Presence; all is sancturary.  </p>
Sandals	<p>Mentioned only in  Mark 6:9  and  Acts 12:8 . The sandal was simply a sole, made of wood or palm-bark, fastened to the foot by leathern straps. Sandals were also made of seal-skin (Ezek.  16:10 ; lit. tahash, "leather;" A.V., "badger's skin;" RSV, "sealskin," or marg., "porpoise-skin"). (See SHOE .) </p>
Sanhedrim	<p>more correctly Sanhedrin (Gr. synedrion), meaning "a sitting together," or a "council." This word (rendered "council," A.V.) is frequently used in the New Testament ( Matthew 5:22 ;  26:59 ;  Mark 15:1 , etc.) to denote the supreme judicial and administrative council of the Jews, which, it is said, was first instituted by Moses, and was composed of seventy men ( Numbers 11:16 Numbers 11:17 ). But that seems to have been only a temporary arrangement which Moses made. This council is with greater probability supposed to have originated among the Jews when they were under the domination of the Syrian kings in the time of the Maccabees. The name is first employed by the Jewish historian Josephus. This "council" is referred to simply as the "chief priests and elders of the people" ( Matthew 26:3 Matthew 26:47 Matthew 26:57 Matthew 26:59 ;  Matthew 27:1 Matthew 27:3 Matthew 27:12 Matthew 27:20 , etc.), before whom Christ was tried on the charge of claiming to be the Messiah. Peter and John were also brought before it for promulgating heresy ( Acts 4:1-23 ;  5:17-41 ); as was also Stephen on a charge of blasphemy ( 6:12-15 ), and Paul for violating a temple by-law ( 22:30 ;  23:1-10 ).  </p><p> The Sanhedrin is said to have consisted of seventy-one members, the high priest being president. They were of three classes (1) the chief priests, or heads of the twenty-four priestly courses ( 1 Chronicles 24 ), (2) the scribes, and (3) the elders. As the highest court of judicature, "in all causes and over all persons, ecclesiastical and civil, supreme," its decrees were binding, not only on the Jews in Palestine, but on all Jews wherever scattered abroad. Its jurisdiction was greatly curtailed by Herod, and afterwards by the Romans. Its usual place of meeting was within the precincts of the temple, in the hall "Gazith," but it sometimes met also in the house of the high priest ( Matthew 26:3 ), who was assisted by two vice-presidents.  </p>
Sansannah	<p>a palm branch, or a thorn bush, a town in the south (the negeb) of Judah ( Joshua 15:31 ); called also Hazarsusah ( 19:5 ), or Hazar-susim ( 1 Chronicles 4:31 ).  </p>
Saph	<p>extension, the son of the giant whom Sibbechai slew ( 2 Samuel 21:18 ); called also Sippai ( 1 Chronicles 20:4 ).  </p>
Saphir	<p>beautiful, a town of Judah ( Micah 1:11 ), identified with es-Suafir, 5 miles south-east of Ashdod.  </p>
Sapphira	<p>beautiful, the wife of Ananias (q.v.). She was a partner in his guilt and also in his punishment ( Acts 5:1-11 ).  </p>
Sapphire	<p>Associated with diamonds ( Exodus 28:18 ) and emeralds ( Ezekiel 28:13 ); one of the stones in the high priest's breastplate. It is a precious stone of a sky-blue colour, probably the lapis lazuli, brought from Babylon. The throne of God is described as of the colour of a sapphire ( Exodus 24:10 ; Compare  Ezekiel 1:26 ).  </p>
Sarah	<p>princess, the wife and at the same time the half-sister of Abraham ( Genesis 11:29 ;  20:12 ). This name was given to her at the time that it was announced to Abraham that she should be the mother of the promised child. Her story is from her marriage identified with that of the patriarch till the time of her death. Her death, at the age of one hundred and twenty-seven years (the only instance in Scripture where the age of a woman is recorded), was the occasion of Abraham's purchasing the cave of Machpelah as a family burying-place.  </p><p> In the allegory of  Galatians 4:22-31  she is the type of the "Jerusalem which is above." She is also mentioned as Sara in  Hebrews 11:11  among the Old Testament worthies, who "all died in faith." (See ABRAHAM .) </p>
Sarai	<p>my princess, the name originally borne by Sarah ( Genesis 11:31 ;  17:15 ).  </p>
Sardine stone	<p>( Revelation 4:3 , RSV, "sardius;" Heb. 'odhem; LXX., Gr. sardion, from a root meaning "red"), a gem of a blood-red colour. It was called "sardius" because obtained from Sardis in Lydia. It is enumerated among the precious stones in the high priest's breastplate ( Exodus 28:17 ;  39:10 ). It is our red carnelian.  </p>
Sardis	<p>the metropolis of Lydia in Asia Minor. It stood on the river Pactolus, at the foot of mount Tmolus. Here was one of the seven Asiatic churches ( Revelation 3:1-6 ). It is now a ruin called Sert-Kalessi.  </p>
Sardonyx	<p>( Revelation 21:20 ), a species of the carnelian combining the sard and the onyx, having three layers of opaque spots or stripes on a transparent red basis. Like the sardine, it is a variety of the chalcedony.  </p>
Sarepta	<p>( Luke 4:26 ). See ZAREPHATH . </p>
Sargon	<p>(In the inscriptions, "Sarra-yukin" [the god] has appointed the king; also "Sarru-kinu," the legitimate king.) On the death of Shalmaneser (B.C. 723), one of the Assyrian generals established himself on the vacant throne, taking the name of "Sargon," after that of the famous monarch, the Sargon of Accad, founder of the first Semitic empire, as well as of one of the most famous libraries of Chaldea. He forthwith began a conquering career, and became one of the most powerful of the Assyrian monarchs. He is mentioned by name in the Bible only in connection with the siege of Ashdod ( Isaiah 20:1 ).  </p><p> At the very beginning of his reign he besieged and took the city of Samaria ( 2 Kings 17:6 ;  18:9-12 ). On an inscription found in the palace he built at Khorsabad, near Nieveh, he says, "The city of Samaria I besieged, I took; 27,280 of its inhabitants I carried away; fifty chariots that were among them I collected," etc. The northern kingdom he changed into an Assyrian satrapy. He afterwards drove Merodach-baladan (q.v.), who kept him at bay for twelve years, out of Babylon, which he entered in triumph. By a succession of victories he gradually enlarged and consolidated the empire, which now extended from the frontiers of Egypt in the west to the mountains of Elam in the east, and thus carried almost to completion the ambitious designs of Tiglath-pileser (q.v.). He was murdered by one of his own soldiers (B.C. 705) in his palace at Khorsabad, after a reign of sixteen years, and was succeeded by his son Sennacherib.  </p>
Satan	<p>adversary; accuser. When used as a proper name, the Hebrew word so rendered has the article "the adversary" ( Job 1:6-12 ;  2:1-7 ). In the New Testament it is used as interchangeable with Diabolos, or the devil, and is so used more than thirty times.  </p><p> He is also called "the dragon," "the old serpent" ( Revelation 12:9 ;  20:2 ); "the prince of this world" ( John 12:31 ;  14:30 ); "the prince of the power of the air" ( Ephesians 2:2 ); "the god of this world" ( 2 Corinthians 4:4 ); "the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience" ( Ephesians 2:2 ). The distinct personality of Satan and his activity among men are thus obviously recognized. He tempted our Lord in the wilderness ( Matthew 4:1-11 ). He is "Beelzebub, the prince of the devils" ( 12:24 ). He is "the constant enemy of God, of Christ, of the divine kingdom, of the followers of Christ, and of all truth; full of falsehood and all malice, and exciting and seducing to evil in every possible way." His power is very great in the world. He is a "roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour" ( 1 Peter 5:8 ). Men are said to be "taken captive by him" ( 2 Timothy 2:26 ). Christians are warned against his "devices" ( 2 Corinthians 2:11 ), and called on to "resist" him ( James 4:7 ). Christ redeems his people from "him that had the power of death, that is, the devil" ( Hebrews 2:14 ). Satan has the "power of death," not as lord, but simply as executioner.  </p>
Satyr	<p>hairy one. Mentioned in Greek mythology as a creature composed of a man and a goat, supposed to inhabit wild and desolate regions. The Hebrew word is rendered also "goat" ( Leviticus 4:24 ) and "devil", i.e., an idol in the form of a goat ( 17:7 ;  2 Chr.  11:15 ). When it is said ( Isaiah 13:21 ; comp  34:14 ) "the satyrs shall dance there," the meaning is that the place referred to shall become a desolate waste. Some render the Hebrew word "baboon," a species of which is found in Babylonia.  </p>
Saul	<p>asked for. </p><li> A king of Edom ( Genesis 36:37 Genesis 36:38 ); called Shaul in  1 Chronicles 1:48 .  </li><li> The son of Kish (probably his only son, and a child of prayer, "asked for"), of the tribe of Benjamin, the first king of the Jewish nation. The singular providential circumstances connected with his election as king are recorded in  <span class="badLink">1 Samuel 810</span> -10. His father's she-asses had strayed, and Saul was sent with a servant to seek for them. Leaving his home at Gibeah ( 10:5 , "the hill of God," A.V.; lit., as in RSV marg., "Gibeah of God"), Saul and his servant went toward the north-west over Mount Ephraim, and then turning north-east they came to "the land of Shalisha," and thence eastward to the land of Shalim, and at length came to the district of Zuph, near Samuel's home at Ramah ( 9:5-10 ). At this point Saul proposed to return from the three days' fruitless search, but his servant suggested that they should first consult the "seer." Hearing that he was about to offer sacrifice, the two hastened into Ramah, and "behold, Samuel came out against them," on his way to the "bamah", i.e., the "height", where sacrifice was to be offered; and in answer to Saul's question, "Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is," Samuel made himself known to him. Samuel had been divinely prepared for his coming ( 9:15-17 ), and received Saul as his guest. He took him with him to the sacrifice, and then after the feast "communed with Saul upon the top of the house" of all that was in his heart. On the morrow Samuel "took a vial of oil and poured it on his head," and anointed Saul as king over Israel ( (9:25-10:8), ), giving him three signs in confirmation of his call to be king. When Saul reached his home in Gibeah the last of these signs was fulfilled, and the Sprit of God came upon him, and "he was turned into another man." The simple countryman was transformed into the king of Israel, a remarkable change suddenly took place in his whole demeanour, and the people said in their astonishment, as they looked on the stalwart son of Kish, "Is Saul also among the prophets?", a saying which passed into a "proverb." (Comp  19:24 .)  <p> The intercourse between Saul and Samuel was as yet unknown to the people. The "anointing" had been in secret. But now the time had come when the transaction must be confirmed by the nation. Samuel accordingly summoned the people to a solemn assembly "before the Lord" at Mizpeh. Here the lot was drawn ( 10:17-27 ), and it fell upon Saul, and when he was presented before them, the stateliest man in all Israel, the air was rent for the first time in Israel by the loud cry, "God save the king!" He now returned to his home in Gibeah, attended by a kind of bodyguard, "a band of men whose hearts God had touched." On reaching his home he dismissed them, and resumed the quiet toils of his former life.  </p><p> Soon after this, on hearing of the conduct of Nahash the Ammonite at Jabeshgilead (q.v.), an army out of all the tribes of Israel rallied at his summons to the trysting-place at Bezek, and he led them forth a great army to battle, gaining a complete victory over the Ammonite invaders at Jabesh ( 11:1-11 ). Amid the universal joy occasioned by this victory he was now fully recognized as the king of Israel. At the invitation of Samuel "all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the Lord in Gilgal." Samuel now officially anointed him as king ( 11:15 ). Although Samuel never ceased to be a judge in Israel, yet now his work in that capacity practically came to an end.  </p><p> Saul now undertook the great and difficult enterprise of freeing the land from its hereditary enemies the Philistines, and for this end he gathered together an army of 3,000 men ( 1 Samuel 13:1 1 Samuel 13:2 ). The Philistines were encamped at Geba. Saul, with 2,000 men, occupied Michmash and Mount Bethel; while his son Jonathan, with 1,000 men, occupied Gibeah, to the south of Geba, and seemingly without any direction from his father "smote" the Philistines in Geba. Thus roused, the Philistines, who gathered an army of 30,000 chariots and 6,000 horsemen, and "people as the sand which is on the sea-shore in multitude," encamped in Michmash, which Saul had evacuated for Gilgal. Saul now tarried for seven days in Gilgal before making any movement, as Samuel had appointed ( 10:8 ); but becoming impatient on the seventh day, as it was drawing to a close, when he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, Samuel appeared and warned him of the fatal consequences of his act of disobedience, for he had not waited long enough ( 1 Samuel 13:13 1 Samuel 13:14 ).  </p><p> When Saul, after Samuel's departure, went out from Gilgal with his 600 men, his followers having decreased to that number ( 13:15 ), against the Philistines at Michmash (q.v.), he had his head-quarters under a pomegrante tree at Migron, over against Michmash, the Wady esSuweinit alone intervening. Here at Gibeah-Geba Saul and his army rested, uncertain what to do. Jonathan became impatient, and with his armour-bearer planned an assault against the Philistines, unknown to Saul and the army ( 14:1-15 ). Jonathan and his armour-bearer went down into the wady, and on their hands and knees climbed to the top of the narrow rocky ridge called Bozez, where was the outpost of the Philistine army. They surprised and then slew twenty of the Philistines, and immediately the whole host of the Philistines was thrown into disorder and fled in great terror. "It was a very great trembling;" a supernatural panic seized the host. Saul and his 600 men, a band which speedily increased to 10,000, perceiving the confusion, pursued the army of the Philistines, and the tide of battle rolled on as far as to Bethaven, halfway between Michmash and Bethel. The Philistines were totally routed. "So the Lord saved Israel that day." While pursuing the Philistines, Saul rashly adjured the people, saying, "Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening." But though faint and weary, the Israelites "smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon" (a distance of from 15 to 20 miles). Jonathan had, while passing through the wood in pursuit of the Philistines, tasted a little of the honeycomb which was abundant there ( 14:27 ). This was afterwards discovered by Saul (ver. 42), and he threatened to put his son to death. The people, however, interposed, saying, "There shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground." He whom God had so signally owned, who had "wrought this great salvation in Israel," must not die. "Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place" ( 1 Samuel 14:24-46 ); and thus the campaign against the Philistines came to an end. This was Saul's second great military success.  </p><p> Saul's reign, however, continued to be one of almost constant war against his enemies round about ( 1 Samuel 14:47 1 Samuel 14:48 ), in all of which he proved victorious. The war against the Amalekites is the only one which is recorded at length ( 1 Samuel 15 ). These oldest and hereditary ( Exodus 17:8 ;  Numbers 14:43-45 ) enemies of Israel occupied the territory to the south and south-west of Palestine. Samuel summoned Saul to execute the "ban" which God had pronounced ( Deuteronomy 25:17-19 ) on this cruel and relentless foe of Israel. The cup of their iniquity was now full. This command was "the test of his moral qualification for being king." Saul proceeded to execute the divine command; and gathering the people together, marched from Telaim ( 1 Samuel 15:4 ) against the Amalekites, whom he smote "from Havilah until thou comest to Shur," utterly destroying "all the people with the edge of the sword", i.e., all that fell into his hands. He was, however, guilty of rebellion and disobedience in sparing Agag their king, and in conniving at his soldiers' sparing the best of the sheep and cattle; and Samuel, following Saul to Gilgal, in the Jordan valley, said unto him, "Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he also hath rejected thee from being king" ( 15:23 ). The kingdom was rent from Saul and was given to another, even to David, whom the Lord chose to be Saul's successor, and whom Samuel anointed ( 16:1-13 ). From that day "the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him." He and Samuel parted only to meet once again at one of the schools of the prophets.  </p><p> David was now sent for as a "cunning player on an harp" ( 1 Samuel 16:16 1 Samuel 16:18 ), to play before Saul when the evil spirit troubled him, and thus was introduced to the court of Saul. He became a great favourite with the king. At length David returned to his father's house and to his wonted avocation as a shepherd for perhaps some three years. The Philistines once more invaded the land, and gathered their army between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim, on the southern slope of the valley of Elah. Saul and the men of Israel went forth to meet them, and encamped on the northern slope of the same valley which lay between the two armies. It was here that David slew Goliath of Gath, the champion of the Philistines ( 17:4-54 ), an exploit which led to the flight and utter defeat of the Philistine army. Saul now took David permanently into his service ( 18:2 ); but he became jealous of him (ver. 9), and on many occasions showed his enmity toward him (ver. 10,11), his enmity ripening into a purpose of murder which at different times he tried in vain to carry out.  </p><p> After some time the Philistines "gathered themselves together" in the plain of Esdraelon, and pitched their camp at Shunem, on the slope of Little Hermon; and Saul "gathered all Israel together," and "pitched in Gilboa" ( 1 Samuel 28:3-14 ). Being unable to discover the mind of the Lord, Saul, accompanied by two of his retinue, betook himself to the "witch of Endor," some 7 or 8 miles distant. Here he was overwhelmed by the startling communication that was mysteriously made to him by Samuel (ver. 16-19), who appeared to him. "He fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel" (ver. 20). The Philistine host "fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines, and fell down slain in Mount Gilboa" ( 31:1 ). In his despair at the disaster that had befallen his army, Saul "took a sword and fell upon it." And the Philistines on the morrow "found Saul and his three sons fallen in Mount Gilboa." Having cut off his head, they sent it with his weapons to Philistia, and hung up the skull in the temple of Dagon at Ashdod. They suspended his headless body, with that of Jonathan, from the walls of Bethshan. The men of Jabesh-gilead afterwards removed the bodies from this position; and having burnt the flesh, they buried the bodies under a tree at Jabesh. The remains were, however, afterwards removed to the family sepulchre at Zelah ( 2 Samuel 21:13 2 Samuel 21:14 ). (See DAVID .) </p></li><li> "Who is also called Paul" (q.v.), the circumcision name of the apostle, given to him, perhaps, in memory of King Saul ( Acts 7:58 ;  8:1 ;  9:1 ).   </li>
Saviour	<p>one who saves from any form or degree of evil. In its highest sense the word indicates the relation sustained by our Lord to his redeemed ones, he is their Saviour. The great message of the gospel is about salvation and the Saviour. It is the "gospel of salvation." Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ secures to the sinner a personal interest in the work of redemption. Salvation is redemption made effectual to the individual by the power of the Holy Spirit. </p>
Scapegoat	<p> Leviticus 16:8-26 ; RSV, "the goat for Azazel" (q.v.), the name given to the goat which was taken away into the wilderness on the day of Atonement ( 16:20-22 ). The priest made atonement over the scapegoat, laying Israel's guilt upon it, and then sent it away, the goat bearing "upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited."  </p><p> At a later period an evasion or modification of the law of Moses was introduced by the Jews. "The goat was conducted to a mountain named Tzuk, situated at a distance of ten Sabbath days' journey, or about six and a half English miles, from Jerusalem. At this place the Judean desert was supposed to commence; and the man in whose charge the goat was sent out, while setting him free, was instructed to push the unhappy beast down the slope of the mountain side, which was so steep as to insure the death of the goat, whose bones were broken by the fall. The reason of this barbarous custom was that on one occasion the scapegoat returned to Jerusalem after being set free, which was considered such an evil omen that its recurrence was prevented for the future by the death of the goat" (Twenty-one Years' Work in the Holy Land). This mountain is now called el-Muntar. </p>
Scarlet	<p>This dye was obtained by the Egyptians from the shell-fish Carthamus tinctorius; and by the Hebrews from the Coccus ilicis, an insect which infests oak trees, called kermes by the Arabians. </p><p> This colour was early known ( Genesis 38:28 ). It was one of the colours of the ephod ( Exodus 28:6 ), the girdle (8), and the breastplate (15) of the high priest. It is also mentioned in various other connections ( Joshua 2:18 ;  2 Sam  1:24 ;  Lamentations 4:5 ;  Nahum 2:3 ). A scarlet robe was in mockery placed on our Lord ( Matthew 27:28 ;  Luke 23:11 ). "Sins as scarlet" ( Isaiah 1:18 ), i.e., as scarlet robes "glaring and habitual." Scarlet and crimson were the firmest of dyes, and thus not easily washed out.  </p>
Sceptre	<p>(Heb. shebet = Gr. skeptron), properly a staff or rod. As a symbol of authority, the use of the sceptre originated in the idea that the ruler was as a shepherd of his people ( Genesis 49:10 ;  Numbers 24:17 ;  Psalms 45:6 ;  Isaiah 14:5 ). There is no example on record of a sceptre having ever been actually handled by a Jewish king.  </p>
Sceva	<p>an implement, a Jew, chief of the priests at Ephesus ( Acts 19:13-16 ); i.e., the head of one of the twenty-four courses of the house of Levi. He had seven sons, who "took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus," in imitation of Paul. They tried their method of exorcism on a fierce demoniac, and failed. His answer to them was to this effect ( 19:15 ): "The Jesus whom you invoke is One whose authority I acknowledge; and the Paul whom you name I recognize to be a servant or messenger of God; but what sort of men are ye who have been empowered to act as you do by neither?" (Lindsay on the Acts of the Apostles.)  </p>
Schism	<p>a separation, an alienation causing divisions among Christians, who ought to be united ( 1 Corinthians 12:25 ).  </p>
Schoolmaster	<p>the law so designated by Paul ( Galatians 3:24 Galatians 3:25 ). As so used, the word does not mean teacher, but pedagogue (shortened into the modern page), i.e., one who was intrusted with the supervision of a family, taking them to and from the school, being responsible for their safety and manners. Hence the pedagogue was stern and severe in his discipline. Thus the law was a pedagogue to the Jews, with a view to Christ, i.e., to prepare for faith in Christ by producing convictions of guilt and helplessness. The office of the pedagogue ceased when "faith came", i.e., the object of that faith, the seed, which is Christ.  </p>
Schools of the Prophets	<p>( 1 Samuel 19:18-24 ;  2 Kings  1 Samuel 2:3 1 Samuel 2:5 1 Samuel 2:7 1 Samuel 2:12 1 Samuel 2:15 ) were instituted for the purpose of training young men for the prophetical and priestly offices. (See PROPHET;  SAMUEL .) </p>
Scorpions	<p>mentioned along with serpents ( Deuteronomy 8:15 ). Used also figuratively to denote wicked persons ( Ezekiel 2:6 ;  Luke 10:19 ); also a particular kind of scourge or whip ( 1 Kings 12:11 ). Scorpions were a species of spider. They abounded in the Jordan valley.  </p>
Scourging	<p>( 1 Kings 12:11 ). Variously administered. In no case were the stripes to exceed forty ( Deuteronomy 25:3 ; Compare  2 Corinthians 11:24 ). In the time of the apostles, in consequence of the passing of what was called the Porcian law, no Roman citizen could be scourged in any case ( Acts 16:22-37 ). (See BASTINADO .) In the scourging of our Lord ( Matthew 27:26 ;  Mark 15:15 ) the words of prophecy ( Isaiah 53:5 ) were fulfilled.  </p>
Scribes	<p>anciently held various important offices in the public affairs of the nation. The Hebrew word so rendered (sopher) is first used to designate the holder of some military office (Judg.  5:14 ; A.V., "pen of the writer;" RSV, "the marshal's staff;" marg., "the staff of the scribe"). The scribes acted as secretaries of state, whose business it was to prepare and issue decrees in the name of the king ( 2 Samuel 8:17 ;  20:25 ;  1 Chronicles 18:16 ;  24:6 ;  1 Kings 4:3 ;  2 Kings  12:9-11 ;  18:18-37 , etc.). They discharged various other important public duties as men of high authority and influence in the affairs of state.  </p><p> There was also a subordinate class of scribes, most of whom were Levites. They were engaged in various ways as writers. Such, for example, was Baruch, who "wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord" ( Jeremiah 36:4 Jeremiah 36:32 ).  </p><p> In later times, after the Captivity, when the nation lost its independence, the scribes turned their attention to the law, gaining for themselves distinction by their intimate acquaintance with its contents. On them devolved the duty of multiplying copies of the law and of teaching it to others ( Ezra 7:6 Ezra 7:10-12 ;  Nehemiah 8:1 Nehemiah 8:4 Nehemiah 8:9 Nehemiah 8:13 ). It is evident that in New Testament times the scribes belonged to the sect of the Pharisees, who supplemented the ancient written law by their traditions ( Matthew 23 ), thereby obscuring it and rendering it of none effect. The titles "scribes" and "lawyers" (q.v.) are in the Gospels interchangeable ( Matthew 22:35 ;  Mark 12:28 ;  Luke 20:39 , etc.). They were in the time of our Lord the public teachers of the people, and frequently came into collision with him. They afterwards showed themselves greatly hostile to the apostles ( Acts 4:5 ;  6:12 ).  </p><p> Some of the scribes, however, were men of a different spirit, and showed themselves friendly to the gospel and its preachers. Thus Gamaliel advised the Sanhedrin, when the apostles were before them charged with "teaching in this name," to "refrain from these men and let them alone" ( Acts 5:34-39 ; comp  23:9 ).  </p>
Scrip	<p>a small bag or wallet usually fastened to the girdle ( 1 Samuel 17:40 ); "a shepherd's bag."  </p><p> In the New Testament it is the rendering of Gr. pera, which was a bag carried by travellers and shepherds, generally made of skin ( Matthew 10:10 ;  Mark 6:8 ;  Luke 9:3 ;  10:4 ). The name "scrip" is meant to denote that the bag was intended to hold scraps, fragments, as if scraped off from larger articles, trifles.  </p>
Scripture	<p>invariably in the New Testament denotes that definite collection of sacred books, regarded as given by inspiration of God, which we usually call the Old Testament ( 2 Timothy 3:15 2 Timothy 3:16 ;  John 20:9 ;  Galatians 3:22 ;  2 Pet  1:20 ). It was God's purpose thus to perpetuate his revealed will. From time to time he raised up men to commit to writing in an infallible record the revelation he gave. The "Scripture," or collection of sacred writings, was thus enlarged from time to time as God saw necessary. We have now a completed "Scripture," consisting of the Old and New Testaments. The Old Testament canon in the time of our Lord was precisely the same as that which we now possess under that name. He placed the seal of his own authority on this collection of writings, as all equally given by inspiration ( Matthew 5:17 ;  7:12 ;  22:40 ;  Luke 16:29 Luke 16:31 ). (See BIBLE;  CANON .) </p>
Scythian	<p>The Scythians consisted of "all the pastoral tribes who dwelt to the north of the Black Sea and the Caspian, and were scattered far away toward the east. Of this vast country but little was anciently known. Its modern representative is Russia, which, to a great extent, includes the same territories." They were the descendants of Japheth ( Genesis 9:27 ). It appears that in apostolic times there were some of this people that embraced Christianity ( Colossians 3:11 ).  </p>
Sea of glass	<p>a figurative expression used in  Revelation 4:6  and  15:2 . According to the interpretation of some, "this calm, glass-like sea, which is never in storm, but only interfused with flame, represents the counsels of God, those purposes of righteousness and love which are often fathomless but never obscure, always the same, though sometimes glowing with holy anger." (Compare  Psalms 36:6 ;  77:19 ;  Romans 11:33-36 .)  </p>[J] indicates this entry was also found in Jack Van Impe's Prophecy Dictionary<br/>
Sea of Jazer	<p>( Jeremiah 48:32 ), a lake, now represented by some ponds in the high valley in which the Ammonite city of Jazer lies, the ruins of which are called Sar.  </p>
Sea, The	<p>(Heb. yam), signifies (1) "the gathering together of the waters," the ocean ( Genesis 1:10 ); (2) a river, as the Nile ( Isaiah 19:5 ), the Euphrates ( Isaiah 21:1 ;  Jeremiah 51:36 ); (3) the Red Sea ( Exodus 14:16 Exodus 14:27 ;  15:4 , etc.); (4) the Mediterranean ( Exodus 23:31 ;  Numbers 34:6 Numbers 34:7 ;  Joshua 15:47 ;  Psalms 80:11 , etc.); (5) the "sea of Galilee," an inland fresh-water lake, and (6) the Dead Sea or "salt sea" ( Genesis 14:3 ;  Numbers 34:3 Numbers 34:12 , etc.). The word "sea" is used symbolically in  Isaiah 60:5 , where it probably means the nations around the Mediterranean. In  Daniel 7:3 ,  Revelation 13:1  it may mean the tumultuous changes among the nations of the earth.  </p>
Sea, The molten	<p>the great laver made by Solomon for the use of the priests in the temple, described in  1 Kings 7:23-26 ;  2 Chr  4:2-5 . It stood in the south-eastern corner of the inner court. It was 5 cubits high, 10 in diameter from brim to brim, and 30 in circumference. It was placed on the backs of twelve oxen, standing with their faces outward. It was capable of containing two or three thousand baths of water (Compare  2 Chronicles 4:5 ), which was originally supplied by the Gibeonites, but was afterwards brought by a conduit from the pools of Bethlehem. It was made of "brass" (copper), which Solomon had taken from the captured cities of Hadarezer, the king of Zobah ( 1 Chronicles 18:8 ). Ahaz afterwards removed this laver from the oxen, and placed it on a stone pavement ( 2 Kings 16:17 ). It was destroyed by the Chaldeans ( 25:13 ).  </p>
Seah	<p>In land measure, a space of 50 cubits long by 50 broad. In measure of capacity, a seah was a little over one peck. (See MEASURE .) </p>
Seal	<p>commonly a ring engraved with some device ( Genesis 38:18 Genesis 38:25 ). Jezebel "wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his seal" ( 1 Kings 21:8 ). Seals are frequently mentioned in Jewish history ( Deuteronomy 32:34 ;  Nehemiah 9:38 ;  10:1 ;  Esther 3:12 ; Cant  8:6 ;  Isaiah 8:16 ;  Jeremiah 22:24 ;  32:44 , etc.). Sealing a document was equivalent to the signature of the owner of the seal. "The use of a signet-ring by the monarch has recently received a remarkable illustration by the discovery of an impression of such a signet on fine clay at Koyunjik, the site of the ancient Nineveh. This seal appears to have been impressed from the bezel of a metallic finger-ring. It is an oval, 2 inches in length by 1 inch wide, and bears the image, name, and titles of the Egyptian king Sabaco" (Rawlinson's Hist. Illus. of the O.T., p. 46). The actual signet-rings of two Egyptian kings (Cheops and Horus) have been discovered. (See SIGNET .) </p><p> The use of seals is mentioned in the New Testament only in connection with the record of our Lord's burial ( Matthew 27:66 ). The tomb was sealed by the Pharisees and chief priests for the purpose of making sure that the disciples would not come and steal the body away (ver. 63,64). The mode of doing this was probably by stretching a cord across the stone and sealing it at both ends with sealing-clay. When God is said to have sealed the Redeemer, the meaning is, that he has attested his divine mission ( John 6:27 ). Circumcision is a seal, an attestation of the covenant ( Romans 4:11 ). Believers are sealed with the Spirit, as God's mark put upon them ( Ephesians 1:13 ;  4:30 ). Converts are by Paul styled the seal of his apostleship, i.e., they are its attestation ( 1 Corinthians 9:2 ). Seals and sealing are frequently mentioned in the book of ( Revelation 5:1 ;  6:1 ;  7:3 ;  10:4 ;  22:10 ).  </p>
Seasons	<p>( Genesis 8:22 ). See AGRICULTURE;  MONTH . </p>
Seba	<p></p><li> One of the sons of Cush ( Genesis 10:7 ).  </li><li> The name of a country and nation ( Isaiah 43:3 ;  45:14 ) mentioned along with Egypt and Ethiopia, and therefore probably in north-eastern Africa. The ancient name of Meroe. The kings of Sheba and Seba are mentioned together in  Psalms 72:10 .   </li>
Sebat	<p>the eleventh month of the Hebrew year, extending from the new moon of February to that of March ( Zechariah 1:7 ). Assyrian sabatu, "storm." (See MONTH .) </p>
Secacah	<p>enclosure, one of the six cities in the wilderness of Judah, noted for its "great cistern" ( Joshua 15:61 ). It has been identified with the ruin Sikkeh, east of Bethany.  </p>
Sechu	<p>a hill or watch-tower, a place between Gibeah and Ramah noted for its "great well" ( 1 Samuel 19:22 ); probably the modern Suweikeh, south of Beeroth.  </p>
Sect	<p>(Gr. hairesis, usually rendered "heresy",  Acts 24:14 ;  1 Chronicles 11:19 ;  Galatians 5:20 , etc.), meaning properly "a choice," then "a chosen manner of life," and then "a religious party," as the "sect" of the Sadducees ( Acts 5:17 ), of the Pharisees ( 15:5 ), the Nazarenes, i.e., Christians ( 24:5 ). It afterwards came to be used in a bad sense, of those holding pernicious error, divergent forms of belief ( 2 Peter 2:1 ;  Galatians 5:20 ).  </p>
Secundus	<p>second, a Christian of Thessalonica who accompanied Paul into Asia ( Acts 20:4 ).  </p>
See r	<p>a name sometimes applied to the prophets because of the visions granted to them. It is first found in  1 Samuel 9:9 . It is afterwards applied to Zadok, Gad, etc. ( 2 Samuel 15:27 ;  24:11 ;  1 Chronicles 9:22 ;  25:5 ;  2 Chr  9:29 ;  Amos 7:12 ;  Micah 3:7 ). The "sayings of the seers" ( 2 Chronicles 33:18 2 Chronicles 33:19 ) is rendered in the Revised Version "the history of Hozai" (marg., the seers; so the LXX.), of whom, however, nothing is known. (See PROPHET .) </p>
See the	<p>to boil ( Exodus 16:23 ).  </p>
See thing pot	<p>a vessel for boiling provisions in ( Job 41:20 ;  Jeremiah 1:13 ).  </p>
Segub	<p>elevated. </p><li> The youngest son of Hiel the Bethelite. His death is recorded in  1 Kings 16:34  (Compare  Joshua 6:26 ).  </li><li> A descendant of Judah ( 1 Chronicles 2:21 1 Chronicles 2:22 ).   </li>
Seir	<p>rough; hairy. </p><li> A Horite; one of the "dukes" of Edom ( Genesis 36:20-30 ).  </li><li> The name of a mountainous region occupied by the Edomites, extending along the eastern side of the Arabah from the south-eastern extremity of the Dead Sea to near the Akabah, or the eastern branch of the Red Sea. It was originally occupied by the Horites ( Genesis 14:6 ), who were afterwards driven out by the Edomites ( Genesis 32:3 ;  Genesis 33:14 Genesis 33:16 ). It was allotted to the descendants of Esau ( Deuteronomy 2:4 Deuteronomy 2:22 ;  Joshua 24:4 ;  2 Chr  <span class="badLink">20:10</span> ;  Isaiah 21:11 ; Exek  25:8 ).  </li><li> A mountain range (not the Edomite range,  Genesis 32:3 ) lying between the Wady Aly and the Wady Ghurab ( Joshua 15:10 ).   </li>
Seirath	<p>woody district; shaggy, a place among the mountains of Ephraim, bordering on Benjamin, to which Ehud fled after he had assassinated Eglon at Jericho ( Judges 3:26 Judges 3:27 ).  </p>
Sela	<p>=Se'lah, rock, the capital of Edom, situated in the great valley extending from the Dead Sea to the Red Sea ( 2 Kings 14:7 ). It was near Mount Hor, close by the desert of Zin. It is called "the rock" ( Judges 1:36 ). When Amaziah took it he called it Joktheel (q.v.) It is mentioned by the prophets ( Isaiah 16:1 ;  Obadiah 1:3 ) as doomed to destruction.  </p><p> It appears in later history and in the Vulgate Version under the name of Petra. "The caravans from all ages, from the interior of Arabia and from the Gulf of Persia, from Hadramaut on the ocean, and even from Sabea or Yemen, appear to have pointed to Petra as a common centre; and from Petra the tide seems again to have branched out in every direction, to Egypt, Palestine, and Syria, through Arsinoe, Gaza, Tyre, Jerusalem, and Damascus, and by other routes, terminating at the Mediterranean." (See EDOM [2].)  </p>
Selah	<p>a word frequently found in the Book of Psalms, and also in  Habakkuk 3:9 Habakkuk 3:13 , about seventy-four times in all in Scripture. Its meaning is doubtful. Some interpret it as meaning "silence" or "pause;" others, "end," "a louder strain," "piano," etc. The LXX. render the word by daplasma i.e., "a division."  </p>
Sela-hammahlekoth	<p>cliff of divisions the name of the great gorge which lies between Hachilah and Maon, south-east of Hebron. This gorge is now called the Wady Malaky. This was the scene of the interview between David and Saul mentioned in 1Sam.26:13. Each stood on an opposing cliff, with this deep chasm between.  </p>
Seleucia	<p>the sea-port of Antioch, near the mouth of the Orontes. Paul and his companions sailed from this port on their first missionary journey ( Acts 13:4 ). This city was built by Seleucus Nicator, the "king of Syria." It is said of him that "few princes have ever lived with so great a passion for the building of cities. He is reputed to have built in all nine Seleucias, sixteen Antiochs, and six Laodiceas." Seleucia became a city of great importance, and was made a "free city" by Pompey. It is now a small village, called el-Kalusi.  </p>
Semei	<p>mentioned in the genealogy of our Lord ( Luke 3:26 ).  </p>
Senaah	<p>thorny, a place many of the inhabitants of which returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel ( Ezra 2:35 ;  Nehemiah 7:38 ).  </p>
Senate	<p>( Acts 5:21 ), the "elders of Israel" who formed a component part of the Sanhedrin.  </p>
Seneh	<p>the acacia; rock-thorn, the southern cliff in the Wady es-Suweinit, a valley south of Michmash, which Jonathan climbed with his armour-bearer ( 1 Samuel 14:4 1 Samuel 14:5 ). The rock opposite, on the other side of the wady, was called Bozez.  </p>
Senir	<p>=Shenir, the name given to Hermon by the Amorites ( Deuteronomy 3:9 ). It means "coat of mail" or "breastplate," and is equivalent to "Sirion." Some interpret the word as meaning "the prominent" or "the snowy mountain." It is properly the name of the central of the three summits of Hermon (q.v.).  </p>
Sennacherib	<p>Sin (the god) sends many brothers, son of Sargon, whom he succeeded on the throne of Assyria (B.C. 705), in the 23rd year of Hezekiah. "Like the Persian Xerxes, he was weak and vainglorious, cowardly under reverse, and cruel and boastful in success." He first set himself to break up the powerful combination of princes who were in league against him. Among these was Hezekiah, who had entered into an alliance with Egypt against Assyria. He accordingly led a very powerful army of at least 200,000 men into Judea, and devastated the land on every side, taking and destroying many cities ( 2 Kings 18:13-16 ; Compare  Isaiah 222429 ,24,29, and  2 Chronicles 32:1-8 ). His own account of this invasion, as given in the Assyrian annals, is in these words: "Because Hezekiah, king of Judah, would not submit to my yoke, I came up against him, and by force of arms and by the might of my power I took forty-six of his strong fenced cities; and of the smaller towns which were scattered about, I took and plundered a countless number. From these places I took and carried off 200,156 persons, old and young, male and female, together with horses and mules, asses and camels, oxen and sheep, a countless multitude; and Hezekiah himself I shut up in Jerusalem, his capital city, like a bird in a cage, building towers round the city to hem him in, and raising banks of earth against the gates, so as to prevent escape...Then upon Hezekiah there fell the fear of the power of my arms, and he sent out to me the chiefs and the elders of Jerusalem with 30 talents of gold and 800 talents of silver, and divers treasures, a rich and immense booty...All these things were brought to me at Nineveh, the seat of my government." (Compare  Isaiah 22:1-13  for description of the feelings of the inhabitants of Jerusalem at such a crisis.)  </p><p> Hezekiah was not disposed to become an Assyrian feudatory. He accordingly at once sought help from Egypt ( 2 Kings 18:20-24 ). Sennacherib, hearing of this, marched a second time into Palestine ( 2 Kings 18:17 2 Kings 18:37 ;  19 ;  2 Chr  32:9-23 ;  Isaiah 36:2-22 .  Isaiah 37:25  should be rendered "dried up all the Nile-arms of Matsor," i.e., of Egypt, so called from the "Matsor" or great fortification across the isthmus of Suez, which protected it from invasions from the east). Sennacherib sent envoys to try to persuade Hezekiah to surrender, but in vain. (See TIRHAKAH .) He next sent a threatening letter ( 2 Kings 19:10-14 ), which Hezekiah carried into the temple and spread before the Lord. Isaiah again brought an encouraging message to the pious king ( 2 Kings 19:20-34 ). "In that night" the angel of the Lord went forth and smote the camp of the Assyrians. In the morning, "behold, they were all dead corpses." The Assyrian army was annihilated.  </p><p> This great disaster is not, as was to be expected, taken notice of in the Assyrian annals. </p><p> Though Sennacherib survived this disaster some twenty years, he never again renewed his attempt against Jerusalem. He was murdered by two of his own sons (Adrammelech and Sharezer), and was succeeded by another son, Esarhaddon (B.C. 681), after a reign of twenty-four years.  </p>
Seorim	<p>barley, the chief of the forth priestly course ( 1 Chronicles 24:8 ).  </p>
Sephar	<p>numbering, ( Genesis 10:30 ), supposed by some to be the ancient Himyaritic capital, "Shaphar," Zaphar, on the Indian Ocean, between the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea.  </p>
Sepharad	<p>( Obadiah 1:20 ), some locality unknown. The modern Jews think that Spain is meant, and hence they designate the Spanish Jews "Sephardim," as they do the German Jews by the name "Ashkenazim," because the rabbis call Germany Ashkenaz. Others identify it with Sardis, the capital of Lydia. The Latin father Jerome regarded it as an Assyrian word, meaning "boundary," and interpreted the sentence, "which is in Sepharad," by "who are scattered abroad in all the boundaries and regions of the earth." Perowne says: "Whatever uncertainty attaches to the word Sepharad, the drift of the prophecy is clear, viz., that not only the exiles from Babylon, but Jewish captives from other and distant regions, shall be brought back to live prosperously within the enlarged borders of their own land."  </p>
Sepharvaim	<p>taken by Sargon, king of Assyria ( 2 Kings 17:24 ;  18:34 ;  19:13 ;  Isaiah 37:13 ). It was a double city, and received the common name Sepharvaim, i.e., "the two Sipparas," or "the two booktowns." The Sippara on the east bank of the Euphrates is now called Abu-Habba; that on the other bank was Accad, the old capital of Sargon I., where he established a great library. (See SARGON .) The recent discovery of cuneiform inscriptions at Tel el-Amarna in Egypt, consisting of official despatches to Pharaoh Amenophis IV. and his predecessor from their agents in Palestine, proves that in the century before the Exodus an active literary intercourse was carried on between these nations, and that the medium of the correspondence was the Babylonian language and script. (See KIRJATH-SEPHER.) </p>
Septuagint	<p>See VERSIONS . </p>
Sepulchre	<p>first mentioned as purchased by Abraham for Sarah from Ephron the Hittite ( Genesis 23:20 ). This was the "cave of the field of Machpelah," where also Abraham and Rebekah and Jacob and Leah were burried ( <span class="badLink">79:29-32</span> ). In  Acts 7:16  it is said that Jacob was "laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem." It has been proposed, as a mode of reconciling the apparent discrepancy between this verse and  Genesis 23:20 , to read  Acts 7:16  thus: "And they [i.e., our fathers] were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor [the son] of Sychem." In this way the purchase made by Abraham is not to be confounded with the purchase made by Jacob subsequently in the same district. Of this purchase by Abraham there is no direct record in the Old Testament. (See TOMB .) </p>
Serah	<p>abundance; princess, the daughter of Asher and grand-daughter of Jacob ( Genesis 46:17 ); called also Sarah ( Numbers 26:46 ; RSV, "Serah").  </p>
Seraiah	<p>soldier of Jehovah. </p><li> The father of Joab ( 1 Chronicles 4:13 1 Chronicles 4:14 ).  </li><li> The grandfather of Jehu ( 1 Chronicles 4:35 ).  </li><li> One of David's scribes or secretaries ( 2 Samuel 8:17 ).  </li><li> A Netophathite ( Jeremiah 40:8 ), a chief priest of the time of Zedekiah. He was carried captive by Nebuchadnezzar to Babylon, and there put to death ( 2 Kings 25:18 2 Kings 25:23 ).  </li><li> Ezra 2:2 .  </li><li> Father of Ezra the scribe ( 7:1 ).  </li><li> A ruler of the temple ( Nehemiah 11:11 ).  </li><li> A priest of the days of Jehoiakim ( Nehemiah 12:1 Nehemiah 12:12 ).  </li><li> The son of Neriah. When Zedekiah made a journey to Babylon to do homage to Nebuchadnezzar, Seraiah had charge of the royal gifts to be presented on that occasion. Jeremiah took advantage of the occasion, and sent with Seraiah a word of cheer to the exiles in Babylon, and an announcement of the doom in store for that guilty city. The roll containing this message ( Jeremiah 50:1-8 ) Seraiah was to read to the exiles, and then, after fixing a stone to it, was to throw it into the Euphrates, uttering, as it sank, the prayer recorded in  Jeremiah 51:59-64 . Babylon was at this time in the height of its glory, the greatest and most powerful monarchy in the world. Scarcely seventy years elapsed when the words of the prophet were all fulfilled.  Jeremiah 51:59  is rendered in the Revised Version, "Now Seraiah was chief chamberlain," instead of "was a quiet prince," as in the Authorized Version.   </li>
Seraphim	<p>mentioned in  Isaiah 6:2 Isaiah 6:3 Isaiah 6:6 Isaiah 6:7 . This word means fiery ones, in allusion, as is supposed, to their burning love. They are represented as "standing" above the King as he sat upon his throne, ready at once to minister unto him. Their form appears to have been human, with the addition of wings. (See ANGELS .) This word, in the original, is used elsewhere only of the "fiery serpents" ( Numbers 21:6 Numbers 21:8 ;  Deuteronomy 8:15 ; Compare  Isaiah 14:29 ;  30:6 ) sent by God as his instruments to inflict on the people the righteous penalty of sin.  </p>
Sered	<p>fear, one of the sons of Zebulun ( Genesis 46:14 ).  </p>
Sergeants	<p>Acts 16:35,38(RSV, "lictors"), officers who attended the magistrates and assisted them in the execution of justice.  </p>
Sergius Paulus	<p>a "prudent man" (RSV, "man of understanding"), the deputy (RSV, "proconsul") of Cyprus ( Acts 13:6-13 ). He became a convert to Christianity under Paul, who visited this island on his first mission to the heathen.  </p><p> A remarkable memorial of this proconsul was recently (1887) discovered at Rome. On a boundary stone of Claudius his name is found, among others, as having been appointed (A.D. 47) one of the curators of the banks and the channel of the river Tiber. After serving his three years as proconsul at Cyprus, he returned to Rome, where he held the office referred to. As he is not saluted in Paul's letter to the Romans, he probably died before it was written.  </p>
Sermon on the mount	<p>After spending a night in solemn meditation and prayer in the lonely mountain-range to the west of the Lake of Galilee ( Luke 6:12 ), on the following morning our Lord called to him his disciples, and from among them chose twelve, who were to be henceforth trained to be his apostles ( Mark 3:14 Mark 3:15 ). After this solemn consecration of the twelve, he descended from the mountain-peak to a more level spot ( Luke 6:17 ), and there he sat down and delivered the "sermon on the mount" ( Matthew 57 -7;  Luke 6:20-49 ) to the assembled multitude. The mountain here spoken of was probably that known by the name of the "Horns of Hattin" (Kurun Hattin), a ridge running east and west, not far from Capernaum. It was afterwards called the "Mount of Beatitudes."  </p>
Serpent	<p>(Heb. nahash; Gr. ophis), frequently noticed in Scripture. More than forty species are found in Syria and Arabia. The poisonous character of the serpent is alluded to in Jacob's blessing on Dan ( Genesis 49:17 ; see  Proverbs 30:18 Proverbs 30:19 ;  James 3:7 ;  Jeremiah 8:17 ). (See ADDER .) </p><p> This word is used symbolically of a deadly, subtle, malicious enemy ( Luke 10:19 ).  </p><p> The serpent is first mentioned in connection with the history of the temptation and fall of our first parents ( Genesis 3 ). It has been well remarked regarding this temptation: "A real serpent was the agent of the temptation, as is plain from what is said of the natural characteristic of the serpent in the first verse of the chapter ( 3:1 ), and from the curse pronounced upon the animal itself. But that Satan was the actual tempter, and that he used the serpent merely as his instrument, is evident (1) from the nature of the transaction; for although the serpent may be the most subtle of all the beasts of the field, yet he has not the high intellectual faculties which the tempter here displayed. </p><li> In the New Testament it is both directly asserted and in various forms assumed that Satan seduced our first parents into sin ( John 8:44 ;  Romans 16:20 ;  2 co  Romans 11:3 Romans 11:14 ;  Revelation 12:9 ;  20:2 )." Hodge's System. Theol., ii. 127.   </li>
Serpent, Fiery	<p>(LXX. "deadly," Vulg. "burning"),  Numbers 21:6 , probably the naja haje of Egypt; some swift-springing, deadly snake ( Isaiah 14:29 ). After setting out from their encampment at Ezion-gaber, the Israelites entered on a wide sandy desert, which stretches from the mountains of Edom as far as the Persian Gulf. While traversing this region, the people began to murmur and utter loud complaints against Moses. As a punishment, the Lord sent serpents among them, and much people of Israel died. Moses interceded on their behalf, and by divine direction he made a "brazen serpent," and raised it on a pole in the midst of the camp, and all the wounded Israelites who looked on it were at once healed. (Compare  John 3:14 John 3:15 .) (See ASP .) This "brazen serpent" was preserved by the Israelites till the days of Hezekiah, when it was destroyed ( 2 Kings 18:4 ). (See BRASS .) </p>
Serug	<p>branch, the father of Nahor ( Genesis 11:20-23 ); called Saruch in  Luke 3:35 .  </p>
Servitor	<p>occurs only in  2 Kings 4:43 , Authorized Version (RSV, "servant"). The Hebrew word there rendered "servitor" is elsewhere rendered "minister," "servant" ( Exodus 24:13 ;  33:11 ). Probably Gehazi, the personal attendant on Elisha, is here meant.  </p>
Seth	<p>appointed; a substitute, the third son of Adam and Eve ( Genesis 4:25 ;  5:3 ). His mother gave him this name, "for God," said she, "hath appointed me [i.e., compensated me with] another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew."  </p>
Sethur	<p>hidden, one of the spies sent to search the Promised Land. He was of the tribe of Asher ( Numbers 13:13 ).  </p>
Seven	<p>This number occurs frequently in Scripture, and in such connections as lead to the supposition that it has some typical meaning. On the seventh day God rested, and hallowed it ( Genesis 2:2 Genesis 2:3 ). The division of time into weeks of seven days each accounts for many instances of the occurrence of this number. This number has been called the symbol of perfection, and also the symbol of rest. "Jacob's seven years' service to Laban; Pharaoh's seven fat oxen and seven lean ones; the seven branches of the golden candlestick; the seven trumpets and the seven priests who sounded them; the seven days' siege of Jericho; the seven churches, seven spirits, seven stars, seven seals, seven vials, and many others, sufficiently prove the importance of this sacred number" (see  Leviticus 25:4 ;  1 Samuel 2:5 ;  Psalms 12:6 ;  79:12 ;  Proverbs 26:16 ;  Isaiah 4:1 ;  Matthew 18:21 Matthew 18:22 ;  Luke 17:4 ). The feast of Passover ( Exodus 12:15 Exodus 12:16 ), the feast of Weeks ( Deuteronomy 16:9 ), of Tabernacles ( 13:15 ), and the Jubilee ( Leviticus 25:8 ), were all ordered by seven. Seven is the number of sacrifice ( 2 Chronicles 29:21 ;  Job 42:8 ), of purification and consecration ( Leviticus 42:6  Leviticus 42:17 ;  Leviticus 8:11 Leviticus 8:33 ;  Leviticus 14:9 Leviticus 14:51 ), of forgiveness ( Matthew 18:21 Matthew 18:22 ;  Luke 17:4 ), of reward ( Deuteronomy 28:7 ;  1 Samuel 2:5 ), and of punishment ( Leviticus 26:21 Leviticus 26:24 Leviticus 26:28 ;  Deuteronomy 28:25 ). It is used for any round number in such passages as  Job 5:19 ;  Proverbs 26:16 Proverbs 26:25 ;  Isaiah 4:1 ;  Matthew 12:45 . It is used also to mean "abundantly" ( Genesis 4:15 Genesis 4:24 ;  Leviticus 26:24 ;  Psalms 79:12 ).  </p>
Seventy weeks	<p>a prophetic period mentioned in  Daniel 9:24 , and usually interpreted on the "year-day" theory, i.e., reckoning each day for a year. This period will thus represent 490 years. This is regarded as the period which would elapse till the time of the coming of the Messiah, dating "from the going forth of the commandment to restore and rebuild Jerusalem" i.e., from the close of the Captivity.  </p>
Shaalabbin	<p>or Shaal'bim, a place of foxes, a town of the tribe of Dan ( Joshua 19:42 ;  Judges 1:35 ). It was one of the chief towns from which Solomon drew his supplies ( 1 Kings 4:9 ). It is probably the modern village of Selbit, 3 miles north of Ajalon.  </p>
Shaaraim	<p>two gates. </p><li> A city in the plain of Judah ( 1 Samuel 17:52 ); called also Sharaim ( Joshua 15:36 ).  </li><li> A town in Simeon ( 1 Chronicles 4:31 ).   </li>
Shaashgaz	<p>servant of the beautiful, a chief eunuch in the second house of the harem of king Ahasuerus ( Esther 2:14 ).  </p>
Shabbethai	<p>Sabbath-born, a Levite who assisted in expounding the law and investigating into the illegal marriages of the Jews ( Ezra 10:15 ;  Nehemiah 8:7 ;  11:16 ).  </p>
Shaddai	<p>the Omnipotent, the name of God in frequent use in the Hebrew Scriptures, generally translated "the Almighty." </p>
Shadow	<p>used in  Colossians 2:17 ;  Hebrews 8:5 ;  10:1  to denote the typical relation of the Jewish to the Christian dispensation.  </p>
Shadrach	<p>Aku's command, the Chaldean name given to Hananiah, one of the Hebrew youths whom Nebuchadnezzar carried captive to Babylon ( Daniel 1:6 Daniel 1:7 ;  3:12-30 ). He and his two companions refused to bow down before the image which Nebuchadnezzar had set up on the plains of Dura. Their conduct filled the king with the greatest fury, and he commanded them to be cast into the burning fiery furnace. Here, amid the fiery flames, they were miraculously preserved from harm. Over them the fire had no power, "neither was a hair of their head singed, neither had the smell of fire passed on them." Thus Nebuchadnezzar learned the greatness of the God of Israel. (See ABEDNEGO .) </p>
Shalem	<p>perfect, a place (probably the village of Salim) some 2 miles east of Jacob's well. There is an abundant supply of water, which may have been the reason for Jacob's settling at this place ( Genesis 33:18-20 ). The Revised Version translates this word, and reads, "Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem," thus not regarding it as a proper name at all.  </p>
Shalim, Land of	<p>land of foxes, a place apparently to the north-west of Jerusalem ( 1 Samuel 9:4 ), perhaps in the neighbourhood of Shaalabbin in Dan ( Joshua 19:42 ).  </p>
Shalisha, Land of	<p>probably the district of Baal-shalisha ( 2 Kings 4:42 ), lying about 12 miles north of Lydda ( 1 Samuel 9:4 ).  </p>
Shallecheth, The gate of	<p>i.e., "the gate of casting out," hence supposed to be the refuse gate; one of the gates of the house of the Lord, "by the causeway of the going up" i.e., the causeway rising up from the Tyropoeon valley = valley of the cheesemakers ( 1 Chronicles 26:16 ).  </p>
Shallum	<p>retribution. </p><li> The son of Jabesh, otherwise unknown. He "conspired against Zachariah, and smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead" ( 2 Kings 15:10 ). He reigned only "a month of days in Samaria" ( 15:13 , marg.). Menahem rose up against Shallum and put him to death ( 2 Kings 15:14 2 Kings 15:15 2 Kings 15:17 ), and became king in his stead.  </li><li> Keeper of the temple vestments in the reign of Josiah ( 2 Kings 22:14 ).  </li><li> One of the posterity of Judah ( 1 Chronicles 2:40 1 Chronicles 2:41 ).  </li><li> A descendant of Simeon ( 1 Chronicles 4:25 ).  </li><li> One of the line of the high priests ( 1 Chronicles 6:13 ).  </li><li> 1 Chronicles 7:13 .  </li><li> A keeper of the gate in the reign of David ( 1 Chronicles 9:17 ).  </li><li> A Levite porter ( 1 Chronicles 9:19 1 Chronicles 9:31 ;  Jeremiah 35:4 ).  </li><li> An Ephraimite chief ( 2 Chronicles 28:12 ).  </li><li> The uncle of the prophet Jeremiah ( Jeremiah 32:7 ).  </li><li> A son of king Josiah ( 1 Chronicles 3:15 ;  Jeremiah 22:11 ), who was elected to succeed his father on the throne, although he was two years younger than his brother Eliakim. He assumed the crown under the name of Jehoahaz (q.v.). He did not imitate the example of his father ( 2 Kings 23:32 ), but was "a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men" ( Ezekiel 19:3 ). His policy was anti-Egyptian therefore. Necho, at that time at Riblah, sent an army against Jerusalem, which at once yielded, and Jehoahaz was carried captive to the Egyptian camp, Eliakim being appointed king in his stead. He remained a captive in Egypt till his death, and was the first king of Judah that died in exile.   </li>
Shalman	<p>an Assyrian king ( Hosea 10:14 ), identified with Shalmaneser II. (Sayce) or IV. (Lenormant), the successor of Pul on the throne of Assyria (B.C. 728). He made war against Hoshea, the king of Israel, whom he subdued and compelled to pay an annual tribute. Hoshea, however, soon after rebelled against his Assyrian conquerer. Shalmaneser again marched against Samaria, which, after a siege of three years, was taken ( 2 Kings 17:3-5 ;  18:9 ) by Sargon (q.v.). A revolution meantime had broken out in Assyria, and Shalmaneser was deposed. Sargon usurped the vacant throne. Schrader thinks that this is probably the name of a king of Moab mentioned on an inscription of Tiglath-pileser as Salamanu.  </p>
Shamgar	<p>The Philistines from the maritime plain had made incursions into the Hebrew upland for the purposes of plunder, when one of this name, the son of Anath, otherwise unknown, headed a rising for the purpose of freeing the land from this oppression. He repelled the invasion, slaying 600 men with an "ox goad" (q.v.). The goad was a formidable sharpointed instrument, sometimes ten feet long. He was probably contemporary for a time with Deborah and Barak ( Judges 3:31 ;  5:6 ).  </p>
Shamir	<p>a sharp thorn. </p><li> One of the sons of Michah ( 1 Chronicles 24:24 ).  </li><li> A town among the mountains of Judah ( Joshua 15:48 ); probably Somerah, 2 1/2 miles north-west of Debir.  </li><li> The residence of Tola, one of the judges, on Mount Ephraim ( Judges 10:1 Judges 10:2 ).   </li>
Shammah	<p>desert. </p><li> One of the "dukes" of Edom ( Genesis 36:13 Genesis 36:17 ).  </li><li> One of the sons of Jesse ( 1 Samuel 16:9 ). He is also called Shimeah ( 2 Samuel 13:3 ) and Shimma ( 1 Chronicles 2:13 ).  </li><li> One of David's three mighty men ( 2 Samuel 23:11 2 Samuel 23:12 ).  </li><li> One of David's mighties ( 2 Samuel 23:25 ); called also Shammoth ( 1 Chronicles 11:27 ) and Shamhuth ( 27:8 ).   </li>
Shammua	<p>heard. </p><li> One of the spies sent out by Moses to search the land ( Numbers 13:4 ). He represented the tribe of Reuben.  </li><li> One of David's sons ( 1 Chronicles 14:4 ;  3:5 , "Shimea;"  2 Samuel 5:14 ).  </li><li> A Levite under ( Nehemiah 11:17 ).   </li>
Shaphan	<p>a coney, a scribe or secretary of king Josiah ( 2 Kings 22:3-7 ). He consulted Huldah concerning the newly-discovered copy of the law which was delivered to him by Hilkiah the priest (8-14). His grandson Gedaliah was governor of Judea ( 25:22 ).  </p>
Shaphat	<p>judge. </p><li> One of the spies. He represented the tribe of Simeon ( Numbers 13:5 ).  </li><li> The father of Elisha ( 1 Kings 19:16-19 ).  </li><li> One of David's chief herdsmen ( 1 Chronicles 27:29 ).   </li>
Shapher	<p>brightness, one of the stations where Israel encamped in the wilderness ( Numbers 33:23 Numbers 33:24 ).  </p>
Sharaim	<p>two gates ( Joshua 15:36 ), more correctly Shaaraim ( 1 Samuel 17:52 ), probably Tell Zakariya and Kefr Zakariya, in the valley of Elah, 3 1/2 miles north-west of Socoh.  </p>
Sharezer	<p>(god) protect the king!, a son of Sennacherib, king of Assyria. He and his brother Adrammelech murdered their father, and then fled into the land of Armenia ( 2 Kings 19:37 ).  </p>
Sharon, Saron	<p>a plain, a level tract extending from the Mediterranean to the hill country to the west of Jerusalem, about 30 miles long and from 8 to 15 miles broad, celebrated for its beauty and fertility ( 1 Chronicles 27:29 ;  Isaiah 33:9 ;  35:2 ;  65:10 ). The "rose of Sharon" is celebrated (Cant  2:1 ). It is called Lasharon (the article la being here a part of the word) in  Joshua 12:18 .  </p>
Shaveh, Valley of	<p>valley of the plain the ancient name of the "king's dale" (q.v.), or Kidron, on the north side of Jerusalem ( Genesis 14:17 ).  </p>
Shaveh-Kiriathaim	<p>plain of Kirja-thaim where Chedorlaomer defeated the Emims, the original inhabitants ( Genesis 14:5 ). Now Kureiyat, north of Dibon, in the land of Moab.  </p>
Shavsha	<p>("Seraiah,"  2 Samuel 8:17 ; "Shisha,"  1 Kings 4:3 ), one of David's secretaries ( 1 Chronicles 18:16 ).  </p>
Shealtiel	<p>asked for of God, father of Zerubbabel ( Ezra 3:2 Ezra 3:8 ;  Nehemiah 12:1 ).  </p>
Shearing-house	<p>( 2 Kings 10:12 2 Kings 10:14 ; marg., "house of shepherds binding sheep." RSV, "the shearing-house of the shepherds;" marg., "house of gathering"), some place between Samaria and Jezreel, where Jehu slew "two and forty men" of the royal family of Judah. The Heb. word Beth-eked so rendered is supposed by some to be a proper name.  </p>
Shear-Jashub	<p>a remnant shall escape or return (i.e., to God), a symbolical name which the prophet Isaiah gave to his son ( Isaiah 7:3 ), perhaps his eldest son.  </p>
Sheba	<p>an oath, seven. </p><li> Heb. shebha, the son of Raamah ( Genesis 10:7 ), whose descendants settled with those of Dedan on the Persian Gulf.  </li><li> Heb. id. A son of Joktan ( Genesis 10:28 ), probably the founder of the Sabeans.  </li><li> Heb. id. A son of Jokshan, who was a son of Abraham by Keturah ( Genesis 25:3 ).  </li><li> Heb. id. A kingdom in Arabia Felix. Sheba, in fact, was Saba in Southern Arabia, the Sabaeans of classical geography, who carried on the trade in spices with the other peoples of the ancient world. They were Semites, speaking one of the two main dialects of Himyaritic or South Arabic. Sheba had become a monarchy before the days of Solomon. Its queen brought him gold, spices, and precious stones ( 1 Kings 10:1-13 ). She is called by our Lord the "queen of the south" ( Matthew 12:42 ).  </li><li> Heb. shebha', "seven" or "an oak." A town of Simeon ( Joshua 19:2 ).  </li><li> Heb. id. A "son of Bichri," of the family of Becher, the son of Benjamin, and thus of the stem from which Saul was descended ( 2 Samuel 20:1-22 ). When David was returning to Jerusalem after the defeat of Absalom, a strife arose between the ten tribes and the tribe of Judah, because the latter took the lead in bringing back the king. Sheba took advantage of this state of things, and raised the standard of revolt, proclaiming, "We have no part in David." With his followers he proceeded northward. David seeing it necessary to check this revolt, ordered Abishai to take the gibborim, "mighty men," and the body-guard and such troops as he could gather, and pursue Sheba. Joab joined the expedition, and having treacherously put Amasa to death, assumed the command of the army. Sheba took refuge in Abel-Bethmaachah, a fortified town some miles north of Lake Merom. While Joab was engaged in laying siege to this city, Sheba's head was, at the instigation of a "wise woman" who had held a parley with him from the city walls, thrown over the wall to the besiegers, and thus the revolt came to an end.   </li>
Shebaniah	<p>whom Jehovah hides, or has made grow up. </p><li> A Levite appointed to blow the trumpet before the ark of God ( 1 Chronicles 15:24 ).  </li><li> Another Levite ( Nehemiah 9:4 Nehemiah 9:5 ).  </li><li> A priest ( Nehemiah 10:12 ).  </li><li> A Levite ( Nehemiah 10:4 ).   </li>
Shebarim	<p>breaks; ruins, a place near Ai ( Joshua 7:5 ; RSV marg., "the quarries").  </p>
Shebna	<p>tender youth, "treasurer" over the house in the reign of Hezekiah, i.e., comptroller or governor of the palace. On account of his pride he was ejected from his office, and Eliakim was promoted to it ( Isaiah 22:15-25 ). He appears to have been the leader of the party who favoured an alliance with Egypt against Assyria. It is conjectured that "Shebna the scribe," who was one of those whom the king sent to confer with the Assyrian ambassador ( 2 Kings 18:18 2 Kings 18:26 2 Kings 18:37 ;  19:2 ;  Isaiah 36:3 Isaiah 36:11 Isaiah 36:22 ;  37:2 ), was a different person.  </p>
Shebuel	<p>captive of God. </p><li> One of the descendants of Gershom, who had charge of the temple treasures in the time of David ( 1 Chronicles 23:16 ;  26:24 ).  </li><li> One of the sons of Heman; one of those whose duty it was to "lift up the horn" in the temple service ( 1 Chronicles 25:4 1 Chronicles 25:5 ); called also Shubael (ver. 20).   </li>
Shecaniah	<p>one intimate with Jehovah. </p><li> A priest to whom the tenth lot came forth when David divided the priests ( 1 Chronicles 24:11 ).  </li><li> One of the priests who were set "to give to their brethren by courses" of the daily portion ( 2 Chronicles 31:15 ).  <p> Shechani'ah, id. </p></li><li> A priest whose sons are mentioned in  1 Chronicles 3:21 1 Chronicles 3:22 .  </li><li> Ezra 8:5 .  </li><li> Ezra 10:2-4 .  </li><li> The father of Shemaiah, who repaired the wall of Jerusalem ( Nehemiah 3:29 ).  </li><li> The father-in-law of Tobiah ( Nehemiah 6:18 ).  </li><li> A priest who returned from the Captivity with Zerubbabel ( Nehemiah 12:3 ; marg., or Shebaniah).   </li>
Shechem	<p>shoulder. </p><li> The son of Hamor the Hivite ( Genesis 33:19 ;  34 ).  </li><li> A descendant of Manasseh ( Numbers 26:31 ;  Joshua 17:2 ).  </li><li> A city in Samaria ( Genesis 33:18 ), called also Sichem ( 12:6 ), Sychem ( Acts 7:16 ). It stood in the narrow sheltered valley between Ebal on the north and Gerizim on the south, these mountains at their base being only some 500 yards apart. Here Abraham pitched his tent and built his first altar in the Promised Land, and received the first divine promise ( Genesis 12:6 Genesis 12:7 ). Here also Jacob "bought a parcel of a field at the hands of the children of Hamor" after his return from Mesopotamia, and settled with his household, which he purged from idolatry by burying the teraphim of his followers under an oak tree, which was afterwards called "the oak of the sorcerer" ( Genesis 33:19 ;  35:4 ;  Judges 9:37 ). (See MEONENIM .) Here too, after a while, he dug a well, which bears his name to this day ( John 4:5 John 4:39-42 ). To Shechem Joshua gathered all Israel "before God," and delivered to them his second parting address ( Joshua 24:1-15 ). He "made a covenant with the people that day" at the very place where, on first entering the land, they had responded to the law from Ebal and Gerizim ( Joshua 24:25 ), the terms of which were recorded "in the book of the law of God", i.e., in the roll of the law of Moses; and in memory of this solemn transaction a great stone was set up "under an oak" (Compare  Genesis 28:18 ;  31:44-48 ;  Exodus 24:4 ;  Joshua 4:3 Joshua 4:8 Joshua 4:9 ), possibly the old "oak of Moreh," as a silent witness of the transaction to all coming time.  <p> Shechem became one of the cities of refuge, the central city of refuge for Western Palestine ( Joshua 20:7 ), and here the bones of Joseph were buried ( 24:32 ). Rehoboam was appointed king in Shechem ( 1 Kings 12:1 1 Kings 12:19 ), but Jeroboam afterwards took up his residence here. This city is mentioned in connection with our Lord's conversation with the woman of Samaria ( John 4:5 ); and thus, remaining as it does to the present day, it is one of the oldest cities of the world. It is the modern Nablus, a contraction for Neapolis, the name given to it by Vespasian. It lies about a mile and a half up the valley on its southern slope, and on the north of Gerizim, which rises about 1,100 feet above it, and is about 34 miles north of Jerusalem. It contains about 10,000 inhabitants, of whom about 160 are Samaritans and 100 Jews, the rest being Christians and Mohammedans.  </p><p> The site of Shechem is said to be of unrivalled beauty. Stanley says it is "the most beautiful, perhaps the only very beautiful, spot in Central Palestine." </p><p> Gaza, near Shechem, only mentioned  1 Chronicles 7:28 , has entirely disappeared. It was destroyed at the time of the Conquest, and its place was taken by Shechem. (See SYCHAR .) </p> </li>
Shechinah	<p>a Chaldee word meaning resting-place, not found in Scripture, but used by the later Jews to designate the visible symbol of God's presence in the tabernacle, and afterwards in Solomon's temple. When the Lord led Israel out of Egypt, he went before them "in a pillar of a cloud." This was the symbol of his presence with his people. For references made to it during the wilderness wanderings, see  Exodus 14:20 ;  40:34-38 ;  Leviticus 9:23 Leviticus 9:24 ;  Numbers 14:10 ;  Numbers 16:19 Numbers 16:42 .  </p><p> It is probable that after the entrance into Canaan this glory-cloud settled in the tabernacle upon the ark of the covenant in the most holy place. We have, however, no special reference to it till the consecration of the temple by Solomon, when it filled the whole house with its glory, so that the priests could not stand to minister ( 1 Kings 8:10-13 ;  2 Chr.  1 Kings 5:13 1 Kings 5:14 ;  7:1-3 ). Probably it remained in the first temple in the holy of holies as the symbol of Jehovah's presence so long as that temple stood. It afterwards disappeared. (See CLOUD .) </p>
Sheep	<p>are of different varieties. Probably the flocks of Abraham and Isaac were of the wild species found still in the mountain regions of Persia and Kurdistan. After the Exodus, and as a result of intercourse with surrounding nations, other species were no doubt introduced into the herds of the people of Israel. They are frequently mentioned in Scripture. The care of a shepherd over his flock is referred to as illustrating God's care over his people ( Psalms 23:1 Psalms 23:2 ;  74:1 ;  77:20 ;  Isaiah 40:11 ;  53:6 ;  John 10:1-5 John 10:7-16 ).  </p><p> "The sheep of Palestine are longer in the head than ours, and have tails from 5 inches broad at the narrowest part to 15 inches at the widest, the weight being in proportion, and ranging generally from 10 to 14 lbs., but sometimes extending to 30 lbs. The tails are indeed huge masses of fat" (Geikie's Holy Land, etc.). The tail was no doubt the "rump" so frequently referred to in the Levitical sacrifices ( Exodus 29:22 ;  Leviticus 3:9 ;  7:3 ;  9:19 ). Sheep-shearing was generally an occasion of great festivity ( Genesis 31:19 ;  Genesis 38:12 Genesis 38:13 ;  1 Samuel 25:4-8 1 Samuel 25:36 ;  2 Sam.  13:23-28 ).  </p>
Sheep-fold	<p>a strong fenced enclosure for the protection of the sheep gathered within it ( Numbers 32:24 ;  1 Chronicles 17:7 ;  Psalms 50:9 ;  78:70 ). In  John 10:16  the Authorized Version renders by "fold" two distinct Greek words, aule and poimne, the latter of which properly means a "flock," and is so rendered in the Revised Version. (See also  Matthew 26:31 ;  Luke 2:8 ;  1 Corinthians 9:7 .) (SeeFOLD .) </p>
Sheep-gate	<p>one of the gates of Jerusalem mentioned by ( Nehemiah 3:1 Nehemiah 3:32 ;  12:39 ). It was in the eastern wall of the city.  </p>
Sheep-market	<p>occurs only in  John 5:2  (marg., also RSV, "sheep-gate"). The word so rendered is an adjective, and it is uncertain whether the noun to be supplied should be "gate" or, following the Vulgate Version, "pool."  </p>
Shekel	<p>weight, the common standard both of weight and value among the Hebrews. It is estimated at 220 English grains, or a little more than half an ounce avoirdupois. The "shekel of the sanctuary" ( Exodus 30:13 ;  Numbers 3:47 ) was equal to twenty gerahs ( Ezekiel 45:12 ). There were shekels of gold ( 1 Chronicles 21:25 ), of silver ( 1 Samuel 9:8 ), of brass ( 17:5 ), and of iron (7). When it became a coined piece of money, the shekel of gold was equivalent to about 2 pound of our money. Six gold shekels, according to the later Jewish system, were equal in value to fifty silver ones.  </p><p> The temple contribution, with which the public sacrifices were bought ( Exodus 30:13 ;  2 Chr  24:6 ), consisted of one common shekel, or a sanctuary half-shekel, equal to two Attic drachmas. The coin, a stater (q.v.), which Peter found in the fish's mouth paid this contribution for both him and Christ ( Matthew 17:24 Matthew 17:27 ). A zuza, or quarter of a shekel, was given by Saul to Samuel ( 1 Samuel 9:8 ).  </p>
Shelah	<p>petition. </p><li> Judah's third son ( Genesis 38:2 Genesis 38:5 Genesis 38:11 Genesis 38:14 ).  </li><li> A son of Arphaxad ( 1 Chronicles 1:18 ).   </li>
Shelemiah	<p>whom Jehovah repays. </p><li> Ezra 10:39 .  </li><li> The father of Hananiah ( Nehemiah 3:30 ).  </li><li> A priest in the time of ( Nehemiah 13:13 ).  </li><li> Father of one of those who accused Jeremiah to Zedekiah ( Jeremiah 37:3 ;  38:1 ).  </li><li> Father of a captain of the ward ( Jeremiah 37:13 ).  </li><li> Jeremiah 36:14 .   </li>
Shem	<p>a name; renown, the first mentioned of the sons of Noah ( Genesis 5:32 ;  6:10 ). He was probably the eldest of Noah's sons. The words "brother of Japheth the elder" in  Genesis 10:21  are more correctly rendered "the elder brother of Japheth," as in the Revised Version. Shem's name is generally mentioned first in the list of Noah's sons. He and his wife were saved in the ark ( 7:13 ). Noah foretold his preeminence over Canaan ( 9:23-27 ). He died at the age of six hundred years, having been for many years contemporary with Abraham, according to the usual chronology. The Israelitish nation sprang from him ( Genesis 11:10-26 ;  1 Chronicles 1:24-27 ).  </p>
Shema	<p>rumour. </p><li> A Reubenite ( 1 Chronicles 5:8 ).  </li><li> A Benjamite ( 1 Chronicles 8:13 ).  </li><li> One who stood by Ezra when he read the law ( Nehemiah 8:4 ).  </li><li> A town in the south of Judah ( Joshua 15:26 ); the same as Sheba (ver. 5).   </li>
Shemaah	<p>rumour, a Benjamite whose sons "came to David to Ziklag" ( 1 Chronicles 12:3 ).  </p>

Shemariah	<p>whom Jehovah guards. </p><li> One who joined David at Ziklag ( 1 Chronicles 12:5 ).  </li><li> Ezra 10:32 Ezra 10:41 .   </li>
Shemeber	<p>soaring on high, the king of Zeboiim, who joined with the other kings in casting off the yoke of Chedorlaomer. After having been reconquered by him, he was rescued by Abraham ( Genesis 14:2 ).  </p>
Sheminith	<p>eight; octave, a musical term, supposed to denote the lowest note sung by men's voices ( 1 Chronicles 15:21 ;  Psalms 6 ;  12 , title).  </p>
Shemiramoth	<p>most high name. </p><li> A Levite in the reign of Jehoshaphat ( 2 Chronicles 17:8 ).  </li><li> A Levite in David's time ( 1 Chronicles 15:18 1 Chronicles 15:20 ).   </li>
Shemuel	<p>heard of God. </p><li> The son of Ammihud. He represented Simeon in the division of the land ( Numbers 34:20 ).  </li><li> Used for "Samuel" ( 1 Chronicles 6:33 , RSV).  </li><li> A prince of the tribe of Issachar ( 1 Chronicles 7:2 ).   </li>
Shen	<p>a tooth, probably some conspicuous tooth-shaped rock or crag ( 1 Samuel 7:12 ), a place between which and Mizpeh Samuel set up his "Ebenezer." In the Hebrew the word has the article prefixed, "the Shen." The site is unknown.  </p>
Shenir	<p>=Senir, ( Deuteronomy 3:9 ; Cant  4:8 ), the name given to Mount Hermon (q.v.) by the Sidonians.  </p>
Sheol	<p>(Heb., "the all-demanding world" = Gr. Hades, "the unknown region"), the invisible world of departed souls. (See HELL .) </p>
Shepham	<p>a treeless place,  Numbers 34:10 Numbers 34:11 : "The coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah."  </p>
Shephatiah	<p>judged of the Lord. </p><li> A son of David by Abital ( 2 Samuel 3:4 ).  </li><li> A Benjamite who joined David at Ziklag ( 1 Chronicles 12:5 ).  </li><li> A Simeonite prince in David's time ( 1 Chronicles 27:16 ).  </li><li> One of Jehoshaphat's sons ( 2 Chronicles 21:2 ).  </li><li> Ezra 2:4 .  </li><li> Ezra 2:57 ;  Nehemiah 7:59 .  </li><li> One of the princes who urged the putting of Jeremiah to death ( Jeremiah 38:1-4 ).   </li>
Shepherd	<p>a word naturally of frequent occurence in Scripture. Sometimes the word "pastor" is used instead ( Jeremiah 2:8 ;  3:15 ;  10:21 ;  12:10 ;  17:16 ). This word is used figuratively to represent the relation of rulers to their subjects and of God to his people ( Psalms 23:1 ;  80:1 ;  Isaiah 40:11 ;  44:28 ;  Jeremiah 25:34 Jeremiah 25:35 ;  Nahum 3:18 ;  John 10:11 John 10:14 ;  Hebrews 13:20 ;  1 Peter 2:25 ;  5:4 ).  </p><p> The duties of a shepherd in an unenclosed country like Palestine were very onerous. "In early morning he led forth the flock from the fold, marching at its head to the spot where they were to be pastured. Here he watched them all day, taking care that none of the sheep strayed, and if any for a time eluded his watch and wandered away from the rest, seeking diligently till he found and brought it back. In those lands sheep require to be supplied regularly with water, and the shepherd for this purpose has to guide them either to some running stream or to wells dug in the wilderness and furnished with troughs. At night he brought the flock home to the fold, counting them as they passed under the rod at the door to assure himself that none were missing. Nor did his labours always end with sunset. Often he had to guard the fold through the dark hours from the attack of wild beasts, or the wily attempts of the prowling thief (see  1 Samuel 17:34 ).", Deane's David.  </p>
Sherebiah	<p>flame of the Lord, a priest whose name is prominent in connection with the work carried on by Ezra and Nehemiah at Jerusalem ( Ezra 8:17 Ezra 8:18 Ezra 8:24-30 ;  Nehemiah 8:7 ;  Nehemiah 9:4 Nehemiah 9:5 ;  10:12 ).  </p>
Sheresh	<p>root, a descendant of Manasseh ( 1 Chronicles 7:16 ).  </p>
Sherezer	<p>one of the messengers whom the children of the Captivity sent to Jerusalem "to pray for them before the Lord" ( Zechariah 7:2 ).  </p>
Sheriffs	<p>( Daniel 3:2 ), Babylonian officers.  </p>
Sheshach	<p>( Jeremiah 25:26 ), supposed to be equivalent to Babel (Babylon), according to a secret (cabalistic) mode of writing among the Jews of unknown antiquity, which consisted in substituting the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet for the first, the last but one for the second, and so on. Thus the letters sh, sh, ch become b, b, l, i.e., Babel. This is supposed to be confirmed by a reference to  Jeremiah 51:41 , where Sheshach and Babylon are in parallel clauses. There seems to be no reason to doubt that Babylon is here intended by this name. (See Streane's Jeremiah, l.c.)  </p>
Sheshai	<p>whitish, one of the sons of Anak ( Numbers 13:22 ). When the Israelites obtained possession of the country the sons of Anak were expelled and slain ( Joshua 15:14 ;  Judges 1:10 ).  </p>
Taanach	<p>a sandy place, an ancient royal city of the Canaanites, on the south-western border of the plain of Esdraelon, 4 miles south of Megiddo. Its king was conquered by ( Joshua 12:21 ). It was assigned to the Levites of the family of Kohath ( 17:11-18 ;  21:25 ). It is mentioned in the song of Deborah ( Judges 5:19 ). It is identified with the small modern village of Ta'annuk.  </p>
Taanath-shiloh	<p>approach to Shiloh, a place on the border of Ephraim ( Joshua 16:6 ), probably the modern T'ana, a ruin 7 miles south-east of Shechem, on the ridge east of the Mukhnah plain.  </p>
Tabbaoth	<p>impressions; rings, "the children of," returned from the Captivity ( Ezra 2:43 ).  </p>
Tabbath	<p>famous, a town in the tribe of Ephraim ( Judges 7:22 ), to the south of Bethshean, near the Jordan.  </p>
Tabeal	<p>goodness of God, the father of one whom the kings of Syria and Samaria in vain attempted to place on the throne of Ahaz ( Isaiah 7:6 ).  </p>
Tabeel	<p>a Persian governor of Samaria, who joined others in the attempt to prevent the rebuilding of Jerusalem ( Ezra 4:7 ).  </p>
Taberah	<p>burning, a place in the wilderness of Paran, where the "fire of the Lord" consumed the murmuring Israelites ( Numbers 11:3 ;  Deuteronomy 9:22 ). It was also called Kibroth-hattaavah (q.v.).  </p>
Tabering	<p>playing on a small drum or tabret. In  Nahum 2:7 , where alone it occurs, it means beating on the breast, as players beat on the tabret.  </p>
Tabernacle	<p></p><li> A house or dwelling-place ( Job 5:24 ;  18:6 , etc.).  </li><li> A portable shrine (Compare  Acts 19:24 ) containing the image of Moloch ( Amos 5:26 ; marg. and RSV, "Siccuth").  </li><li> The human body ( 2 Corinthians 5:1 2 Corinthians 5:4 ); a tent, as opposed to a permanent dwelling.  </li><li> The sacred tent (Heb. mishkan, "the dwelling-place"); the movable tent-temple which Moses erected for the service of God, according to the "pattern" which God himself showed to him on the mount ( Exodus 25:9 ;  Hebrews 8:5 ). It is called "the tabernacle of the congregation," rather "of meeting", i.e., where God promised to meet with Israel ( Exodus 29:42 ); the "tabernacle of the testimony" ( Exodus 38:21 ;  Numbers 1:50 ), which does not, however, designate the whole structure, but only the enclosure which contained the "ark of the testimony" ( Exodus 25:16 Exodus 25:22 ;  Numbers 9:15 ); the "tabernacle of witness" ( Numbers 17:8 ); the "house of the Lord" ( Deuteronomy 23:18 ); the "temple of the Lord" ( Joshua 6:24 ); a "sanctuary" ( Exodus 25:8 ).  <p> A particular account of the materials which the people provided for the erection and of the building itself is recorded in  <span class="badLink">Exodus 2540</span> -40. The execution of the plan mysteriously given to Moses was intrusted to Bezaleel and Aholiab, who were specially endowed with wisdom and artistic skill, probably gained in Egypt, for this purpose ( Exodus 35:30-35 ). The people provided materials for the tabernacle so abundantly that Moses was under the necessity of restraining them ( 36:6 ). These stores, from which they so liberally contributed for this purpose, must have consisted in a great part of the gifts which the Egyptians so readily bestowed on them on the eve of the ( Exodus 12:35 Exodus 12:36 ).  </p><p> The tabernacle was a rectangular enclosure, in length about 45 feet (i.e., reckoning a cubit at 18 inches) and in breadth and height about 15. Its two sides and its western end were made of boards of acacia wood, placed on end, resting in sockets of brass, the eastern end being left open ( Exodus 26:22 ). This framework was covered with four coverings, the first of linen, in which figures of the symbolic cherubim were wrought with needlework in blue and purple and scarlet threads, and probably also with threads of gold ( Exodus 26:1-6 ;  36:8-13 ). Above this was a second covering of twelve curtains of black goats'-hair cloth, reaching down on the outside almost to the ground ( Exodus 26:7-11 ). The third covering was of rams' skins dyed red, and the fourth was of badgers' skins (Heb. tahash, i.e., the dugong, a species of seal),  Exodus 25:5 ;  26:14 ;  Exodus 35:7 Exodus 35:23 ;  36:19 ;  39:34 .  </p><p> Internally it was divided by a veil into two chambers, the exterior of which was called the holy place, also "the sanctuary" ( Hebrews 9:2 ) and the "first tabernacle" (6); and the interior, the holy of holies, "the holy place," "the Holiest," the "second tabernacle" ( Exodus 28:29 ;  Hebrews 9:3 Hebrews 9:7 ). The veil separating these two chambers was a double curtain of the finest workmanship, which was never passed except by the high priest once a year, on the great Day of Atonement. The holy place was separated from the outer court which enclosed the tabernacle by a curtain, which hung over the six pillars which stood at the east end of the tabernacle, and by which it was entered.  </p><p> The order as well as the typical character of the services of the tabernacle are recorded in  Hebrews 9 ;  10:19-22 .  </p><p> The holy of holies, a cube of 10 cubits, contained the "ark of the testimony", i.e., the oblong chest containing the two tables of stone, the pot of manna, and Aaron's rod that budded.  </p><p> The holy place was the western and larger chamber of the tabernacle. Here were placed the table for the shewbread, the golden candlestick, and the golden altar of incense. </p><p> Round about the tabernacle was a court, enclosed by curtains hung upon sixty pillars ( Exodus 27:9-18 ). This court was 150 feet long and 75 feet broad. Within it were placed the altar of burnt offering, which measured 7 1/2 feet in length and breadth and 4 1/2 feet high, with horns at the four corners, and the laver of brass ( Exodus 30:18 ), which stood between the altar and the tabernacle.  </p><p> The whole tabernacle was completed in seven months. On the first day of the first month of the second year after the Exodus, it was formally set up, and the cloud of the divine presence descended on it ( Exodus 39:22-43 ;  40:1-38 ). It cost 29 talents 730 shekels of gold, 100 talents 1,775 shekels of silver, 70 talents 2,400 shekels of brass ( Exodus 38:24-31 ).  </p><p> The tabernacle was so constructed that it could easily be taken down and conveyed from place to place during the wanderings in the wilderness. The first encampment of the Israelites after crossing the Jordan was at Gilgal, and there the tabernacle remained for seven years ( Joshua 4:19 ). It was afterwards removed to Shiloh ( Joshua 18:1 ), where it remained during the time of the Judges, till the days of Eli, when the ark, having been carried out into the camp when the Israelites were at war with the Philistines, was taken by the enemy ( 1 Samuel 4 ), and was never afterwards restored to its place in the tabernacle. The old tabernacle erected by Moses in the wilderness was transferred to Nob ( 1 Samuel 21:1 ), and after the destruction of that city by Saul ( 22:9 ;  1 Chronicles 16:39 1 Chronicles 16:40 ), to Gibeon. It is mentioned for the last time in  1 Chronicles 21:29 . A new tabernacle was erected by David at Jerusalem ( 2 Samuel 6:17 ;  1 Chronicles 16:1 ), and the ark was brought from Perez-uzzah and deposited in it ( 2 Samuel 6:8-17 ;  2 Chr  1:4 ).  </p><p> The word thus rendered ('ohel) in  Exodus 33:7  denotes simply a tent, probably Moses' own tent, for the tabernacle was not yet erected.  </p> </li>
Tabernacles, Feast of	<p>the third of the great annual festivals of the Jews ( Leviticus 23:33-43 ). It is also called the "feast of ingathering" ( Exodus 23:16 ;  Deuteronomy 16:13 ). It was celebrated immediately after the harvest, in the month Tisri, and the celebration lasted for eight days ( Leviticus 23:33-43 ). During that period the people left their homes and lived in booths formed of the branches of trees. The sacrifices offered at this time are mentioned in  Numbers 29:13-38 . It was at the time of this feast that Solomon's temple was dedicated ( 1 Kings 8:2 ). Mention is made of it after the return from the Captivity. This feast was designed (1) to be a memorial of the wilderness wanderings, when the people dwelt in booths ( Leviticus 23:43 ), and (2) to be a harvest thanksgiving ( Nehemiah 8:9-18 ). The Jews, at a later time, introduced two appendages to the original festival, viz., (1) that of drawing water from the Pool of Siloam, and pouring it upon the altar ( John 7:2 John 7:37 ), as a memorial of the water from the rock in Horeb; and (2) of lighting the lamps at night, a memorial of the pillar of fire by night during their wanderings.  </p><p> "The feast of Tabernacles, the harvest festival of the Jewish Church, was the most popular and important festival after the Captivity. At Jerusalem it was a gala day. It was to the autumn pilgrims, who arrived on the 14th (of the month Tisri, the feast beginning on the 15th) day, like entrance into a silvan city. Roofs and courtyards, streets and squares, roads and gardens, were green with boughs of citron and myrtle, palm and willow. The booths recalled the pilgrimage through the wilderness. The ingathering of fruits prophesied of the spiritual harvest.", Valling's Jesus Christ, p. 133.  </p>
Tabitha	<p>(in Greek called Dorcas), gazelle, a disciple at Joppa. She was distinguished for her alms-deeds and good works. Peter, who was sent for from Lydda on the occasion of her death, prayed over the dead body, and said, "Tabitha, arise." And she opened her eyes and sat up; and Peter "gave her his hand, and raised her up; and calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive" ( Acts 9:36-43 ).  </p>
Tables	<p>( Mark 7:4 ) means banqueting-couches or benches, on which the Jews reclined when at meals. This custom, along with the use of raised tables like ours, was introduced among the Jews after the Captivity. Before this they had, properly speaking, no table. That which served the purpose was a skin or piece of leather spread out on the carpeted floor. Sometimes a stool was placed in the middle of this skin. (See ABRAHAM'S BOSOM; BANQUET;  MEALS .) </p>
Tablet	<p>probably a string of beads worn round the neck ( Exodus 35:22 ;  Numbers 31:50 ). In  Isaiah 3:20  the Hebrew word means a perfume-box, as it is rendered in the Revised Version.  </p>
Tabor	<p>a height. </p><li> Now Jebel et-Tur, a cone-like prominent mountain, 11 miles west of the Sea of Galilee. It is about 1,843 feet high. The view from the summit of it is said to be singularly extensive and grand. This is alluded to in  Psalms 89:12 ;  Jeremiah 46:18 . It was here that Barak encamped before the battle with Sisera (q.v.)  Judges 4:6-14 . There is an old tradition, which, however, is unfounded, that it was the scene of the transfiguration of our Lord. (See HERMON .) "The prominence and isolation of Tabor, standing, as it does, on the border-land between the northern and southern tribes, between the mountains and the central plain, made it a place of note in all ages, and evidently led the psalmist to associate it with Hermon, the one emblematic of the south, the other of the north." There are some who still hold that this was the scene of the transfiguration (q.v.). </li><li> A town of Zebulum ( 1 Chronicles 6:77 ).  </li><li> The "plain of Tabor" ( 1 Samuel 10:3 ) should be, as in the Revised Version, "the oak of Tabor." This was probably the Allon-bachuth of  Genesis 35:8 .   </li>
Tabret	<p>(Heb. toph), a timbrel (q.v.) or tambourine, generally played by women ( Genesis 31:27 ;  1 Samuel 10:5 ;  18:6 ). In  Job 17:6  the word (Heb. topheth) "tabret" should be, as in the Revised Version, "an open abhorring" (marg., "one in whose face they spit;" lit., "a spitting in the face").  </p>
Tabrimon	<p>good is Rimmon, the father of Benhadad, king of Syria ( 1 Kings 15:18 ).  </p>
Taches	<p>hooks or clasps by which the tabernacle curtains were connected ( Exodus 26:6 Exodus 26:11 Exodus 26:33 ;  35:11 ).  </p>
Tachmonite	<p>=Hach'monite, a name given to Jashobeam ( 2 Samuel 23:8 ; Compare  1 Chronicles 11:11 ).  </p>
Tackling	<p>( Isaiah 33:23 ), the ropes attached to the mast of a ship. In  Acts 27:19  this word means generally the furniture of the ship or the "gear" ( 27:17 ), all that could be removed from the ship.  </p>
Tadmor	<p>palm, a city built by Solomon "in the wilderness" ( 2 Chronicles 8:4 ). In  1 Kings 9:18 , where the word occurs in the Authorized Version, the Hebrew text and the Revised Version read "Tamar," which is properly a city on the southern border of Palestine and toward the wilderness (Compare  Ezekiel 47:19 ;  48:28 ). In  2 Chronicles 8:14  Tadmor is mentioned in connection with Hamath-zobah. It is called Palmyra by the Greeks and Romans. It stood in the great Syrian wilderness, 176 miles from Damascus and 130 from the Mediterranean and was the centre of a vast commercial traffic with Western Asia. It was also an important military station. (See SOLOMON .) "Remains of ancient temples and palaces, surrounded by splendid colonnades of white marble, many of which are yet standing, and thousands of prostrate pillars, scattered over a large extent of space, attest the ancient magnificence of this city of palms, surpassing that of the renowned cities of Greece and Rome." </p>
Tahapanes	<p>=Tahpanhes=Tehaphnehes, (called "Daphne" by the Greeks, now Tell Defenneh), an ancient Egyptian city, on the Tanitic branch of the Nile, about 16 miles from Pelusium. The Jews from Jerusalem fled to this place after the death of Gedaliah (q.v.), and settled there for a time ( Jeremiah 2:16 ;  43:7 ;  44:1 ;  46:14 ). A platform of brick-work, which there is every reason to believe was the pavement at the entry of Pharaoh's palace, has been discovered at this place. "Here," says the discoverer, Mr. Petrie, "the ceremony described by [ Jeremiah 43:8-10 ; "brick-kiln", i.e., pavement of brick] took place before the chiefs of the fugitives assembled on the platform, and here Nebuchadnezzar spread his royal pavilion" (RSV, "brickwork").  </p>
Tahpenes	<p>the wife of Pharaoh, who gave her sister in marriage to Hadad the Edomite ( 1 Kings 11:19 1 Kings 11:20 ).  </p>
Tahtim-hodshi	<p>the land of the newly inhabited, ( 2 Samuel 24:6 ). It is conjectured that, instead of this word, the reading should be, "the Hittites of Kadesh," the Hittite capital, on the Orontes. It was apparently some region east of the Jordan and north of Gilead.  </p>
Tale	<p></p><li> Heb. tokhen, "a task," as weighed and measured out = tally, i.e., the number told off; the full number ( Exodus 5:18 ; see  1 Samuel 18:27 ;  1 Chronicles 9:28 ). In  Ezekiel 45:11  rendered "measure."  </li><li> Heb. hegeh, "a thought;" "meditation" ( Psalms 90:9 ); meaning properly "as a whisper of sadness," which is soon over, or "as a thought." The LXX. and Vulgate render it "spider;" the Authorized Version and Revised Version, "as a tale" that is told. In  Job 37:2  this word is rendered "sound;" Revised Version margin, "muttering;" and in  Ezekiel 2:10 , "mourning."   </li>
Talent	<p>of silver contained 3,000 shekels ( Exodus 38:25 Exodus 38:26 ), and was equal to 94 3/7 lbs. avoirdupois. The Greek talent, however, as in the LXX., was only 82 1/4 lbs. It was in the form of a circular mass, as the Hebrew name <i> kikkar</i> denotes. A talent of gold was double the weight of a talent of silver ( 2 Samuel 12:30 ). Parable of the talents ( Matthew 18:24 ;  25:15 ).  </p>
Talitha cumi	<p>( Mark 5:41 ), a Syriac or Aramaic expression, meaning, "Little maid, arise." Peter, who was present when the miracle was wrought, recalled the actual words used by our Lord, and told them to Mark.  </p>
Talmai	<p>abounding in furrows. </p><li> One of the Anakim of Hebron, who were slain by the men of Judah under Caleb ( Numbers 13:22 ;  Joshua 15:14 ;  Judges 1:10 ).  </li><li> A king of Geshur, to whom Absalom fled after he had put Amnon to death ( 2 Samuel 3:3 ;  13:37 ). His daughter, Maachah, was one of David's wives, and the mother of Absalom ( 1 Chronicles 3:2 ).   </li>
Talmon	<p>oppressed. </p><li> A Levite porter ( 1 Chronicles 9:17 ;  Nehemiah 11:19 ).  </li><li> One whose descendants returned with Zerubbabel to Jerusalem ( Ezra 2:42 ;  Nehemiah 7:45 ); probably the same as (1).   </li>
Tamar	<p>palm. </p><li> A place mentioned by ( Ezekiel 47:19 ;  48:28 ), on the southeastern border of Palestine. Some suppose this was "Tadmor" (q.v.).  </li><li> The daughter-in-law of Judah, to whose eldest son, Er, she was married ( Genesis 38:6 ). After her husband's death, she was married to Onan, his brother (8), and on his death, Judah promised to her that his third son, Shelah, would become her husband. This promise was not fulfilled, and hence Tamar's revenge and Judah's great guilt ( 38:12-30 ).  </li><li> A daughter of David ( 2 Samuel 13:1-32 ;  1 Chronicles 3:9 ), whom Amnon shamefully outraged and afterwards "hated exceedingly," thereby illustrating the law of human nature noticed even by the heathen, "Proprium humani ingenii est odisse quem laeseris", i.e., "It is the property of human nature to hate one whom you have injured."  </li><li> A daughter of Absalom ( 2 Samuel 14:27 ).   </li>
Tamarisk	<p>Heb. 'eshel ( Genesis 21:33 ;  1 Samuel 22:6 ;  31:13 , in the RSV; but in A.V., "grove," "tree"); Arab. asal. Seven species of this tree are found in Palestine. It is a "very graceful tree, with long feathery branches and tufts closely clad with the minutest of leaves, and surmounted in spring with spikes of beautiful pink blosoms, which seem to envelop the whole tree in one gauzy sheet of colour" (Tristram's Nat. Hist.).  </p>
Tammuz	<p>a corruption of Dumuzi, the Accadian sun-god (the Adonis of the Greeks), the husband of the goddess Ishtar. In the Chaldean calendar there was a month set apart in honour of this god, the month of June to July, the beginning of the summer solstice. At this festival, which lasted six days, the worshippers, with loud lamentations, bewailed the funeral of the god, they sat "weeping for Tammuz" ( Ezekiel 8:14 ).  </p><p> The name, also borrowed from Chaldea, of one of the months of the Hebrew calendar. </p>
Tanhumeth	<p>consolation, a Netophathite; one of the captains who supported Gedaliah ( 2 Kings 25:23 ;  Jeremiah 40:8 ).  </p>
Tanis	<p>( Ezekiel 30:14 , marg.). See ZOAN . </p>
Tappuah	<p>apple-region. </p><li> A town in the valley or lowland of Judah; formerly a royal city of the Canaanites ( Joshua 12:17 ;  15:34 ). It is now called Tuffuh, about 12 miles west of Jerusalem.  </li><li> A town on the border of Ephraim ( Joshua 16:8 ). The "land" of Tappuah fell to Manasseh, but the "city" to Ephraim ( 17:8 ).  </li><li> En-tappuah, the well of the apple, probably one of the springs near Yassuf ( Joshua 17:7 ).   </li>
Tarah	<p>stopping; station, an encampment of the Hebrews in the wilderness ( Numbers 33:27 Numbers 33:28 ).  </p>
Tares	<p>the bearded darnel, mentioned only in  Matthew 13:25-30 . It is the Lolium temulentum, a species of rye-grass, the seeds of which are a strong soporific poison. It bears the closest resemblance to wheat till the ear appears, and only then the difference is discovered. It grows plentifully in Syria and Palestine.  </p>
Target	<p>( 1 Samuel 17:6 , A.V., after the LXX. and Vulg.), a kind of small shield. The margin has "gorget," a piece of armour for the throat. The Revised Version more correctly renders the Hebrew word (kidon) by "javelin." The same Hebrew word is used in  Joshua 8:18  (A.V., "spear;" RSV, "javelin");  Job 39:23  (A.V., "shield;" RSV, "javelin");  41:29  (A.V., "spear;" RSV, "javelin").  </p>
Tarshish	<p>a Sanscrit or Aryan word, meaning "the sea coast." </p><li> One of the "sons" of Javan ( Genesis 10:4 ;  1 Chronicles 1:7 ).  </li><li> The name of a place which first comes into notice in the days of Solomon. The question as to the locality of Tarshish has given rise to not a little discussion. Some think there was a Tarshish in the East, on the Indian coast, seeing that "ships of Tarshish" sailed from Eziongeber, on the Red Sea ( 1 Kings 9:26 ;  22:48 ;  2 Chr  9:21 ). Some, again, argue that Carthage was the place so named. There can be little doubt, however, that this is the name of a Phoenician port in Spain, between the two mouths of the Guadalquivir (the name given to the river by the Arabs, and meaning "the great wady" or water-course). It was founded by a Carthaginian colony, and was the farthest western harbour of Tyrian sailors. It was to this port Jonah's ship was about to sail from Joppa. It has well been styled "the Peru of Tyrian adventure;" it abounded in gold and silver mines.  <p> It appears that this name also is used without reference to any locality. "Ships of Tarshish" is an expression sometimes denoting simply ships intended for a long voyage ( Isaiah 23:1 Isaiah 23:14 ), ships of a large size (sea-going ships), whatever might be the port to which they sailed. Solomon's ships were so styled ( 1 Kings 10:22 ;  22:49 ).  </p> </li>
Tarsus	<p>the chief city of Cilicia. It was distinguished for its wealth and for its schools of learning, in which it rivalled, nay, excelled even Athens and Alexandria, and hence was spoken of as "no mean city." It was the native place of the Apostle Paul ( Acts 21:39 ). It stood on the banks of the river Cydnus, about 12 miles north of the Mediterranean. It is said to have been founded by Sardanapalus, king of Assyria. It is now a filthy, ruinous Turkish town, called Tersous. (See PAUL .) </p>
Tartak	<p>prince of darkness, one of the gods of the Arvites, who colonized part of Samaria after the deportation of Israel by Shalmaneser ( 2 Kings 17:31 ).  </p>
Tartan	<p>an Assyrian word, meaning "the commander-in-chief." </p><li> One of Sennacherib's messengers to Hezekiah ( 2 Kings 18:17 ). </li><li> One of Sargon's generals ( Isaiah 20:1 ).   </li>
Tatnai	<p>gift, a Persian governor (Heb. pehah, i.e., "satrap;" modern "pasha") "on this side the river", i.e., of the whole tract on the west of the Euphrates. This Hebrew title <i> pehah</i> is given to governors of provinces generally. It is given to ( Nehemiah 5:14 ) and to Zerubbabel ( Haggai 1:1 ). It is sometimes translated "captain" ( 1 Kings 20:24 ;  Daniel 3:2 Daniel 3:3 ), sometimes also "deputy" ( Esther 8:9 ;  9:3 ). With others, Tatnai opposed the rebuilding of the temple ( Ezra 5:6 ); but at the command of Darius, he assisted the Jews ( 6:1-13 ).  </p>
Taverns, The three	<p>a place on the great "Appian Way," about 11 miles from Rome, designed for the reception of travellers, as the name indicates. Here Paul, on his way to Rome, was met by a band of Roman Christians ( Acts 28:15 ). The "Tres Tabernae was the first mansio or mutatio, that is, halting-place for relays, from Rome, or the last on the way to the city. At this point three roads run into the Via Appia, that from Tusculum, that from Alba Longa, and that from Antium; so necessarily here would be a halting-place, which took its name from the three shops there, the general store, the blacksmith's, and the refreshment-house...Tres Tabernae is translated as Three Taverns, but it more correctly means three shops" (Forbes's Footsteps of St. Paul, p.20).  </p>
Taxes	<p>first mentioned in the command ( Exodus 30:11-16 ) that every Jew from twenty years and upward should pay an annual tax of "half a shekel for an offering to the Lord." This enactment was faithfully observed for many generations ( 2 Chronicles 24:6 ;  Matthew 17:24 ).  </p><p> Afterwards, when the people had kings to reign over them, they began, as Samuel had warned them ( 1 Samuel 8:10-18 ), to pay taxes for civil purposes ( 1 Kings 4:7 ;  9:15 ;  12:4 ). Such taxes, in increased amount, were afterwards paid to the foreign princes that ruled over them.  </p><p> In the New Testament the payment of taxes, imposed by lawful rulers, is enjoined as a duty ( Romans 13:1-7 ;  1 Peter 2:13 1 Peter 2:14 ). Mention is made of the tax (telos) on merchandise and travellers ( Matthew 17:25 ); the annual tax (phoros) on property ( Luke 20:22 ;  23:2 ); the poll-tax (kensos, "tribute,"  Matthew 17:25 ;  22:17 ;  Mark 12:14 ); and the temple-tax ("tribute money" = two drachmas = half shekel,  Matthew 17:24-27 ; Compare  Exodus 30:13 ). (See TRIBUTE .) </p>
Taxing	<p>( Luke 2:2 ; RSV, "enrolment"), "when Cyrenius was governor of Syria," is simply a census of the people, or an enrolment of them with a view to their taxation. The decree for the enrolment was the occasion of Joseph and Mary's going up to Bethlehem. It has been argued by some that Cyrenius (q.v.) was governor of Cilicia and Syria both at the time of our Lord's birth and some years afterwards. This decree for the taxing referred to the whole Roman world, and not to Judea alone. (See CENSUS .) </p>
Tebeth	<p>( Esther 2:16 ), a word probably of Persian origin, denoting the cold time of the year; used by the later Jews as denoting the tenth month of the year. Assyrian tebituv, "rain."  </p>
Teil tree	<p>(an old name for the lime-tree, the tilia),  Isaiah 6:13 , the terebinth, or turpentine-tree, the Pistacia terebinthus of botanists. The Hebrew word here used (elah) is rendered oak (q.v.) in  Genesis 35:4 ;  Judges 6:11 Judges 6:19 ;  Isaiah 1:29 , etc. In  Isaiah 61:3  it is rendered in the plural "trees;"  Hosea 4:13 , "elm" (RSV, "terebinth").  Hosea 4:13 , "elm" (RSV, "terebinth"). In 1Sam 17:2,19it is taken as a proper name, "Elah" (RSV marg., "terebinth").  </p><p> "The terebinth of Mamre, or its lineal successor, remained from the days of Abraham till the fourth century of the Christian era, and on its site Constantine erected a Christian church, the ruins of which still remain." </p><p> This tree "is seldom seen in clumps or groves, never in forests, but stands isolated and weird-like in some bare ravine or on a hill-side where nothing else towers above the low brushwood" (Tristram). </p>
Tekel	<p>weighed ( Daniel 5:27 ).  </p>
Tekoa, Tekoah	<p>pitching of tents; fastening down, a town of Judah, about 12 miles south of Jerusalem, and visible from the city. From this place Joab procured a "wise woman," who pretended to be in great affliction, and skilfully made her case known to David. Her address to the king was in the form of an apologue, similar to that of Nathan ( 2 Samuel 12:1-6 ). The object of Joab was, by the intervention of this woman, to induce David to bring back Absalom to Jerusalem ( 2 Samuel 14:2 2 Samuel 14:4 2 Samuel 14:9 ).  </p><p> This was also the birth-place of the prophet ( Amos 1:1 ).  </p><p> It is now the village of Teku'a, on the top of a hill among ruins, 5 miles south of Bethlehem, and close to Beth-haccerem ("Herod's mountain").  </p>
Tel-abib	<p>hill of corn, a place on the river Chebar, the residence of Ezekiel ( Ezekiel 3:15 ). The site is unknown.  </p>
Telaim	<p>young lambs, a place at which Saul gathered his army to fight against Amalek ( 1 Samuel 15:4 ); probably the same as Telem (2).  </p>
Telassar	<p>or Thelasar, ( Isaiah 37:12 ;  2 Kings  19:12 ), a province in the south-east of Assyria, probably in Babylonia. Some have identified it with Tel Afer, a place in Mesopotamia, some 30 miles from Sinjar.  </p>
Telem	<p>oppression. </p><li> A porter of the temple in the time of ( Ezra 10:24 ).  </li><li> A town in the southern border of Judah ( Joshua 15:24 ); probably the same as Telaim.   </li>
Tel-haresha	<p>hill of the wood, a place in Babylon from which some captive Jews returned to Jerusalem ( Ezra 2:59 ;  Nehemiah 7:61 ).  </p>
Tel-melah	<p>hill of salt, a place in Babylon from which the Jews returned (id.). </p>
Tema	<p>south; desert, one of the sons of Ishmael, and father of a tribe so called ( Genesis 25:15 ;  1 Chronicles 1:30 ;  Job 6:19 ;  Isaiah 21:14 ;  Jeremiah 25:23 ) which settled at a place to which he gave his name, some 250 miles south-east of Edom, on the route between Damascus and Mecca, in the northern part of the Arabian peninsula, toward the Syrian desert; the modern Teyma'.  </p>
Teman	<p>id. </p><li> A grandson of Esau, one of the "dukes of Edom" ( Genesis 36:11 Genesis 36:15 Genesis 36:42 ).  </li><li> A place in Southern Idumea, the land of "the sons of the east," frequently mentioned in the Old Testament. It was noted for the wisdom of its inhabitants ( Amos 1:12 ;  Obadiah 1:8 ;  Jeremiah 49:7 ;  Ezekiel 25:13 ). It was divided from the hills of Paran by the low plain of Arabah ( Habakkuk 3:3 ).   </li>
Temanite	<p>a man of Teman, the designation of Eliphaz, one of Job's three friends ( Job 2:11 ;  22:1 ).  </p>
Temeni	<p>one of the sons of Ashur, the father of Tekoa ( 1 Chronicles 4:6 ).  </p>
Temple	<p>first used of the tabernacle, which is called "the temple of the Lord" ( 1 Samuel 1:9 ). In the New Testament the word is used figuratively of Christ's human body ( John 2:19 John 2:21 ). Believers are called "the temple of God" ( 1 Corinthians 3:16 1 Corinthians 3:17 ). The Church is designated "an holy temple in the Lord" ( Ephesians 2:21 ). Heaven is also called a temple ( Revelation 7:5 ). We read also of the heathen "temple of the great goddess Diana" ( Acts 19:27 ).  </p><p> This word is generally used in Scripture of the sacred house erected on the summit of Mount Moriah for the worship of God. It is called "the temple" ( 1 Kings 6:17 ); "the temple [RSV, 'house'] of the Lord" ( 2 Kings 11:10 ); "thy holy temple" ( Psalms 79:1 ); "the house of the Lord" ( 2 Chronicles 23:5 2 Chronicles 23:12 ); "the house of the God of Jacob" ( Isaiah 2:3 ); "the house of my glory" ( 60:7 ); an "house of prayer" ( 56:7 ;  Matthew 21:13 ); "an house of sacrifice" ( 2 Chronicles 7:12 ); "the house of their sanctuary" ( 2 Chronicles 36:17 ); "the mountain of the Lord's house" ( Isaiah 2:2 ); "our holy and our beautiful house" ( 64:11 ); "the holy mount" ( 27:13 ); "the palace for the Lord God" ( 1 Chronicles 29:1 ); "the tabernacle of witness" ( 2 Chronicles 24:6 ); "Zion" ( Psalms 74:2 ;  84:7 ). Christ calls it "my Father's house" ( John 2:16 ).  </p>
Temple, Herods	<p>The temple erected by the exiles on their return from Babylon had stood for about five hundred years, when Herod the Great became king of Judea. The building had suffered considerably from natural decay as well as from the assaults of hostile armies, and Herod, desirous of gaining the favour of the Jews, proposed to rebuild it. This offer was accepted, and the work was begun (B.C. 18), and carried out at great labour and expense, and on a scale of surpassing splendour. The main part of the building was completed in ten years, but the erection of the outer courts and the embellishment of the whole were carried on during the entire period of our Lord's life on earth ( John 2:16 John 2:19-21 ), and the temple was completed only A.D. 65. But it was not long permitted to exist. Within forty years after our Lord's crucifixion, his prediction of its overthrow was accomplished ( Luke 19: :  4144 -44). The Roman legions took the city of Jerusalem by storm, and notwithstanding the strenuous efforts Titus made to preserve the temple, his soldiers set fire to it in several places, and it was utterly destroyed (A.D. 70), and was never rebuilt.  </p><p> Several remains of Herod's stately temple have by recent explorations been brought to light. It had two courts, one intended for the Israelites only, and the other, a large outer court, called "the court of the Gentiles," intended for the use of strangers of all nations. These two courts were separated by a low wall, as Josephus states, some 4 1/2 feet high, with thirteen openings. Along the top of this dividing wall, at regular intervals, were placed pillars bearing in Greek an inscription to the effect that no stranger was, on the pain of death, to pass from the court of the Gentiles into that of the Jews. At the entrance to a graveyard at the north-western angle of the Haram wall, a stone was discovered by M. Ganneau in 1871, built into the wall, bearing the following inscription in Greek capitals: "No stranger is to enter within the partition wall and enclosure around the sanctuary. Whoever is caught will be responsible to himself for his death, which will ensue."  </p><p> There can be no doubt that the stone thus discovered was one of those originally placed on the boundary wall which separated the Jews from the Gentiles, of which Josephus speaks. </p><p> It is of importance to notice that the word rendered "sanctuary" in the inscription was used in a specific sense of the inner court, the court of the Israelites, and is the word rendered "temple" in  John 2:15  and  Acts 21:28 Acts 21:29 . When Paul speaks of the middle wall of partition ( Ephesians 2:14 ), he probably makes allusion to this dividing wall. Within this partition wall stood the temple proper, consisting of, (1) the court of the women, 8 feet higher than the outer court; (2) 10 feet higher than this court was the court of Israel; (3) the court of the priests, again 3 feet higher; and lastly (4) the temple floor, 8 feet above that; thus in all 29 feet above the level of the outer court.  </p><p> The summit of Mount Moriah, on which the temple stood, is now occupied by the Haram esh-Sherif, i.e., "the sacred enclosure." This enclosure is about 1,500 feet from north to south, with a breadth of about 1,000 feet, covering in all a space of about 35 acres. About the centre of the enclosure is a raised platform, 16 feet above the surrounding space, and paved with large stone slabs, on which stands the Mohammedan mosque called Kubbet es-Sahkra i.e., the "Dome of the Rock," or the Mosque of Omar. This mosque covers the site of Solomon's temple. In the centre of the dome there is a bare, projecting rock, the highest part of Moriah (q.v.), measuring 60 feet by 40, standing 6 feet above the floor of the mosque, called the sahkra, i.e., "rock." Over this rock the altar of burnt-offerings stood. It was the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite. The exact position on this "sacred enclosure" which the temple occupied has not been yet definitely ascertained. Some affirm that Herod's temple covered the site of Solomon's temple and palace, and in addition enclosed a square of 300 feet at the south-western angle. The temple courts thus are supposed to have occupied the southern portion of the "enclosure," forming in all a square of more than 900 feet. It is argued by others that Herod's temple occupied a square of 600 feet at the south-west of the "enclosure."  </p>
Temple, Solomons	<p>Before his death David had "with all his might" provided materials in great abundance for the building of the temple on the summit of Mount Moriah ( 1 Chronicles 22:14 ;  29:4 ;  2 Chr  3:1 ), on the east of the city, on the spot where Abraham had offered up Isaac ( Genesis 22:1-14 ). In the beginning of his reign Solomon set about giving effect to the desire that had been so earnestly cherished by his father, and prepared additional materials for the building. From subterranean quarries at Jerusalem he obtained huge blocks of stone for the foundations and walls of the temple. These stones were prepared for their places in the building under the eye of Tyrian master-builders. He also entered into a compact with Hiram II., king of Tyre, for the supply of whatever else was needed for the work, particularly timber from the forests of Lebanon, which was brought in great rafts by the sea to Joppa, whence it was dragged to Jerusalem ( 1 Kings 5 ). As the hill on which the temple was to be built did not afford sufficient level space, a huge wall of solid masonry of great height, in some places more than 200 feet high, was raised across the south of the hill, and a similar wall on the eastern side, and in the spaces between were erected many arches and pillars, thus raising up the general surface to the required level. Solomon also provided for a sufficient water supply for the temple by hewing in the rocky hill vast cisterns, into which water was conveyed by channels from the "pools" near Bethlehem. One of these cisterns, the "great sea," was capable of containing three millions of gallons. The overflow was led off by a conduit to the Kidron.  </p><p> In all these preparatory undertakings a space of about three years was occupied; and now the process of the erection of the great building began, under the direction of skilled Phoenician builders and workmen, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign, 480 years after the Exodus ( 1 Kings 6 ;  2 Chr.  3 ). Many thousands of labourers and skilled artisans were employed in the work. Stones prepared in the quarries underneath the city ( 1 Kings 5:17 1 Kings 5:18 ) of huge dimension (see QUARRIES) were gradually placed on the massive walls, and closely fitted together without any mortar between, till the whole structure was completed. No sound of hammer or axe or any tool of iron was heard as the structure arose ( 6:7 ). "Like some tall palm the noiseless fabric sprang." The building was 60 cubits long, 20 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high. The engineers of the Palestine Exploration Fund, in their explorations around the temple area, discovered what is believed to have been the "chief corner stone" of the temple, "the most interesting stone in the world." It lies at the bottom of the south-eastern angle, and is 3 feet 8 inches high by 14 feet long. It rests on the solid rock at a depth of 79 feet 3 inches below the present surface. (See PINNACLE .) In examining the walls the engineers were "struck with admiration at the vastness of the blocks and the general excellence of the workmanship." </p><p> At length, in the autumn of the eleventh year of his reign, seven and a half years after it had been begun, the temple was completed in all its architectural magnificence and beauty. For thirteen years there it stood, on the summit of Moriah, silent and unused. The reasons for this strange delay in its consecration are unknown. At the close of these thirteen years preparations for the dedication of the temple were made on a scale of the greatest magnificence. The ark was solemnly brought from the tent in which David had deposited it to the place prepared for it in the temple, and the glory-cloud, the symbol of the divine presence, filled the house. Then Solomon ascended a platform which had been erected for him, in the sight of all the people, and lifting up his hands to heaven poured out his heart to God in prayer ( 1 Kings 8 ;  2 Chr.  67 ,7). The feast of dedication, which lasted seven days, followed by the feast of tabernacles, marked a new era in the history of Israel. On the eighth day of the feast of tabernacles, Solomon dismissed the vast assemblage of the people, who returned to their homes filled with joy and gladness, "Had Solomon done no other service beyond the building of the temple, he would still have influenced the religious life of his people down to the latest days. It was to them a perpetual reminder and visible symbol of God's presence and protection, a strong bulwark of all the sacred traditions of the law, a witness to duty, an impulse to historic study, an inspiration of sacred song."  </p><p> The temple consisted of, </p><li> The oracle or most holy place ( 1 Kings 6:19 ;  8:6 ), called also the "inner house" ( 6:27 ), and the "holiest of all" ( Hebrews 9:3 ). It was 20 cubits in length, breadth, and height. It was floored and wainscotted with cedar ( 1 Kings 6:16 ), and its walls and floor were overlaid with gold ( 1 Kings 6:20 1 Kings 6:21 1 Kings 6:30 ). There was a two-leaved door between it and the holy place overlaid with gold ( 2 Chronicles 4:22 ); also a veil of blue purple and crimson and fine linen ( 2 Chronicles 3:14 ; Compare  Exodus 26:33 ). It had no windows ( 1 Kings 8:12 ). It was indeed the dwelling-place of God. </li><li> The holy place (q.v.),  1 Kings 8:8-10 , called also the "greater house" ( 2 Chronicles 3:5 ) and the "temple" ( 1 Kings 6:17 ). </li><li> The porch or entrance before the temple on the east ( 1 Kings 6:3 ;  2 Chr  3:4 ;  29:7 ). In the porch stood the two pillars Jachin and Boaz ( 1 Kings 7:21 ;  2 Kings  11:14 ;  23:3 ). </li><li> The chambers, which were built about the temple on the southern, western, and northern sides ( 1 Kings 6:5-10 ). These formed a part of the building.  <p> Round about the building were, </p></li><li> The court of the priests ( 2 Chronicles 4:9 ), called the "inner court" ( 1 Kings 6:36 ). It contained the altar of burnt-offering ( 2 Chronicles 15:8 ), the brazen sea ( 2 Chronicles 4:2-5 2 Chronicles 4:10 ), and ten lavers ( 1 Kings 7:38 1 Kings 7:39 ). </li><li> The great court, which surrounded the whole temple ( 2 Chronicles 4:9 ). Here the people assembled to worship God ( Jeremiah 19:14 ;  26:2 ).  <p> This temple erected by Solomon was many times pillaged during the course of its history, (1)  1 Kings 14:25 1 Kings 14:26 ; (2)  2 Kings 14:14 ; (3)  2 Kings 16:8 2 Kings 16:17 2 Kings 16:18 ;  2 Kings 2 Kings  2 Kings 18:15 2 Kings 18:16 . At last it was pillaged and destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar ( 2 Kings 24:13 ;  2 Chr  36:7 ). He burned the temple, and carried all its treasures with him to Babylon ( 2 Kings 25:9-17 ;  2 Chr  36:19 ;  Isaiah 64:11 ). These sacred vessels were at length, at the close of the Captivity, restored to the Jews by Cyrus ( Ezra 1:7-11 ).  </p> </li>
Temple, the Second	<p>After the return from captivity, under Zerubbabel (q.v.) and the high priest Jeshua, arrangements were almost immediately made to reorganize the long-desolated kingdom. The body of pilgrims, forming a band of 42,360, including children, having completed the long and dreary journey of some four months, from the banks of the Euphrates to Jerusalem, were animated in all their proceeding by a strong religious impulse, and therefore one of their first cares was to restore their ancient worship by rebuilding the temple. On the invitation of Zerubbabel, the governor, who showed them a remarkable example of liberality by contributing personally 1,000 golden darics (probably about $6,000), besides other gifts, the people with great enthusiasm poured their gifts into the sacred treasury ( Ezra 2 ). First they erected and dedicated the altar of Jehovah on the exact spot where it had formerly stood, and they then cleared away the charred heaps of debris which occupied the site of the old temple; and in the second month of the second year (B.C. 535), amid great public excitement and rejoicing ( Psalms 116 ;  117 ;  118 ), the foundations of the second temple were laid. A wide interest was felt in this great movement, although it was regarded with mingled feelings by the spectators ( Haggai 2:3 ;  Zechariah 4:10 ). The Samaritans made proposals for a co-operation in the work. Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the elders, however, declined all such cooperation: Judah must build the temple without help. Immediately evil reports were spread regarding the Jews. The Samaritans sought to "frustrate their purpose" ( Ezra 4:5 ), and sent messengers to Ecbatana and Susa, with the result that the work was suspended. Seven years after this Cyrus died ingloriously, having killed himself in Syria when on his way back from Egypt to the east, and was succeeded by his son Cambyses (B.C. 529-522), on whose death the "false Smerdis," an imposter, occupied the throne for some seven or eight months, and then Darius Hystaspes became king (B.C. 522). In the second year of this monarch the work of rebuilding the temple was resumed and carried forward to its completion ( Ezra 5: :  617 -17;  6:1-15 ), under the stimulus of the earnest counsels and admonitions of the prophets Haggai and Zechariah. It was ready for consecration in the spring of B.C. 516, twenty years after the return from captivity.  </p><p> This second temple had not the ark, the Urim and Thummim, the holy oil, the sacred fire, the tables of stone, the pot of manna, and Aaron's rod. As in the tabernacle, there was in it only one golden lamp for the holy place, one table of shewbread, and the incense altar, with golden censers, and many of the vessels of gold that had belonged to Solomon's temple that had been carried to Babylon but restored by Cyrus ( Ezra 1:7-11 ).  </p><p> This second temple also differed from the first in that, while in the latter there were numerous "trees planted in the courts of the Lord," there were none in the former. The second temple also had for the first time a space, being a part of the outer court, provided for proselytes who were worshippers of Jehovah, although not subject to the laws of Judaism. </p><p> The temple, when completed, was consecrated amid great rejoicings on the part of all the people ( Ezra 6:16 ), although there were not wanting outward evidences that the Jews were no longer an independent people, but were subject to a foreign power.  </p><p> Haggai 2:9  is rightly rendered in the Revised Version, "The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former," instead of, "The glory of this latter house," etc., in the Authorized Version. The temple, during the different periods of its existence, is regarded as but one house, the one only house of God (comp  2:3 ). The glory here predicted is spiritual glory and not material splendour. "Christ himself, present bodily in the temple on Mount Zion during his life on earth, present spiritually in the Church now, present in the holy city, the heavenly Jerusalem, of which he is the temple, calling forth spiritual worship and devotion is the glory here predicted" (Perowne).  </p>
Temptation	<p></p><li> Trial; a being put to the test. Thus God "tempted [  Genesis 22: : 1; RSV, 'did prove'] Abraham;" and afflictions are said to tempt, i.e., to try, men ( James 1:2 James 1:12 ; Compare  Deuteronomy 8:2 ), putting their faith and patience to the test. </li><li> Ordinarily, however, the word means solicitation to that which is evil, and hence Satan is called "the tempter" ( Matthew 4:3 ). Our Lord was in this way tempted in the wilderness. That temptation was not internal, but by a real, active, subtle being. It was not self-sought. It was submitted to as an act of obedience on his part. "Christ was led, driven. An unseen personal force bore him a certain violence is implied in the words" ( Matthew 4:1-11 ).  <p> The scene of the temptation of our Lord is generally supposed to have been the mountain of Quarantania (q.v.), "a high and precipitous wall of rock, 1,200 or 1,500 feet above the plain west of Jordan, near Jericho."  </p><p> Temptation is common to all ( Daniel 12:10 ;  Zechariah 13:9 ;  Psalms 66:10 ;  Luke 22:31 Luke 22:40 ;  Hebrews 11:17 ;  James 1:12 ;  1 Peter 1:7 ;  4:12 ). We read of the temptation of Joseph ( Genesis 39 ), of David ( 2 Samuel 24 ;  1 Chronicles 21 ), of Hezekiah ( 2 Chronicles 32:31 ), of Daniel ( Daniel 6 ), etc. So long as we are in this world we are exposed to temptations, and need ever to be on our watch against them.  </p> </li>
Tent	<p></p><li> Heb. 'ohel ( Genesis 9:21 Genesis 9:27 ). This word is used also of a dwelling or habitation ( 1 Kings 8:66 ;  Isaiah 16:5 ;  Jeremiah 4:20 ), and of the temple ( Ezekiel 41:1 ). When used of the tabernacle, as in  1 Kings 1:39 , it denotes the covering of goat's hair which was placed over the mishcan.  </li><li> Heb. mishcan (Cant  1:8 ), used also of a dwelling ( Job 18:21 ;  Psalms 87:2 ), the grave ( Isaiah 22:16 ; comp  14:18 ), the temple ( Psalms 46:4 ;  84:2 ;  132:5 ), and of the tabernacle ( Exodus 25:9 ;  26:1 ;  40:9 ;  Numbers 1:50 Numbers 1:53 ;  10:11 ). When distinguished from 'ohel, it denotes the twelve interior curtains which lay upon the framework of the tabernacle (q.v.).  </li><li> Heb. kubbah ( Numbers 25:8 ), a dome-like tent devoted to the impure worship of Baal-peor.  </li><li> Heb. succah ( 2 Samuel 11:11 ), a tent or booth made of green boughs or branches (see  Genesis 33:17 ;  Leviticus 23:34 Leviticus 23:42 ;  Psalms 18:11 ;  Jonah 4:5 ;  Isaiah 4:6 ;  Nehemiah 8:15-17 , where the word is variously rendered).  <p> Jubal was "the father of such as dwell in tents" ( Genesis 4:20 ). The patriarchs were "dwellers in tents" ( Genesis 9:21 Genesis 9:27 ;  12:8 ;  13:12 ;  26:17 ); and during their wilderness wanderings all Israel dwelt in tents ( Exodus 16:16 ;  Deuteronomy 33:18 ;  Joshua 7:24 ). Tents have always occupied a prominent place in Eastern life ( 1 Samuel 17:54 ;  2 Kings  7:7 ;  Psalms 120:5 ; Cant  1:5 ). Paul the apostle's occupation was that of a tent-maker ( Acts 18:3 ); i.e., perhaps a maker of tent cloth.  </p> </li>
Tenth deal	<p>i.e., the tenth part of an ephah (as in the RSV), equal to an omer or six pints. The recovered leper, to complete his purification, was required to bring a trespass, a sin, and a burnt offering, and to present a meal offering, a tenth deal or an omer of flour for each, with oil to make it into bread or cakes ( Leviticus 14:10 Leviticus 14:21 ; Compare  Exodus 16:36 ;  29:40 ).  </p>
Terah	<p>the wanderer; loiterer, for some unknown reason emigrated with his family from his native mountains in the north to the plains of Mesopotamia. He had three sons, Haran, Nahor, and Abraham, and one daughter, Sarah. He settled in "Ur of the Chaldees," where his son Haran died, leaving behind him his son Lot. Nahor settled at Haran, a place on the way to Ur. Terah afterwards migrated with Abraham (probably his youngest son) and Lot (his grandson), together with their families, from Ur, intending to go with them to Canaan; but he tarried at Haran, where he spent the remainder of his days, and died at the age of two hundred and five years ( Genesis 11:24-32 ;  Joshua 24:2 ). What a wonderful part the descendants of this Chaldean shepherd have played in the history of the world!  </p>
Teraphim	<p>givers of prosperity, idols in human shape, large or small, analogous to the images of ancestors which were revered by the Romans. In order to deceive the guards sent by Saul to seize David, Michal his wife prepared one of the household teraphim, putting on it the goat's-hair cap worn by sleepers and invalids, and laid it in a bed, covering it with a mantle. She pointed it out to the soldiers, and alleged that David was confined to his bed by a sudden illness ( 1 Samuel 19:13-16 ). Thus she gained time for David's escape. It seems strange to read of teraphim, images of ancestors, preserved for superstitious purposes, being in the house of David. Probably they had been stealthily brought by Michal from her father's house. "Perhaps," says Bishop Wordsworth, "Saul, forsaken by God and possessed by the evil spirit, had resorted to teraphim (as he afterwards resorted to witchcraft); and God overruled evil for good, and made his very teraphim (by the hand of his own daughter) to be an instrument for David's escape.", Deane's David, p. 32. Josiah attempted to suppress this form of idolatry ( 2 Kings 23:24 ). The ephod and teraphim are mentioned together in  Hosea 3:4 . It has been supposed by some (Cheyne's Hosea) that the "ephod" here mentioned, and also in  Judges 8:24-27 , was not the part of the sacerdotal dress so called ( Exodus 28:6-14 ), but an image of Jehovah overlaid with gold or silver (Compare Judg. 17,18;  1 Samuel 21:9 ;  1 Samuel 23:6 1 Samuel 23:9 ;  1 Samuel 30:7 1 Samuel 30:8 ), and is thus associated with the teraphim. (See THUMMIM .) </p>
Terebinth	<p>(RSV marg. of  Deuteronomy 11:30 , etc.), the Pistacia terebinthus of botanists; a tree very common in the south and east of Palestine. (See OAK .) </p>
Teresh	<p>severe, a eunuch or chamberlain in the palace of Ahasuerus, who conspired with another to murder him. The plot was detected by Mordecai, and the conspirators were put to death ( Esther 2:21 ;  6:2 ).  </p>
Tertius	<p>the third, a Roman Christian whom Paul employed as his amanuensis in writing his epistle to the ( Romans 16:22 ).  </p>
Tertullus	<p>a modification of "Tertius;" a Roman advocate, whom the Jews employed to state their case against Paul in the presence of Felix ( Acts 24:1-9 ). The charges he adduced against the apostle were, "First, that he created disturbances among the Romans throughout the empire, an offence against the Roman government (crimen majestatis). Secondly, that he was a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes; disturbed the Jews in the exercise of their religion, guaranteed by the state; introduced new gods, a thing prohibited by the Romans. And thirdly, that he attempted to profane the temple, a crime which the Jews were permitted to punish."  </p>
Testament	<p>occurs twelve times in the New Testament ( Hebrews 9:15 , etc.) as the rendering of the Gr. diatheke, which is twenty times rendered "covenant" in the Authorized Version, and always so in the Revised Version. The Vulgate translates incorrectly by testamentum, whence the names "Old" and "New Testament," by which we now designate the two sections into which the Bible is divided. (See BIBLE .) </p>
Testimony	<p></p><li> Witness or evidence ( 2 Thessalonians 1:10 ).  </li><li> The Scriptures, as the revelation of God's will ( 2 Kings 11:12 ;  Psalms 19:7 ;  119:88 ;  Isaiah 8:16 Isaiah 8:20 ).  </li><li> The altar raised by the Gadites and Reubenites ( Joshua 22:10 ).   </li>
Testimony, Tabernacle of	<p>the tabernacle, the great glory of which was that it contained "the testimony", i.e., the "two tables" ( Exodus 38:21 ). The ark in which these tables were deposited was called the "ark of the testimony" ( 40:3 ), and also simply the "testimony" ( 27:21 ;  30:6 ).  </p>
Tetrarch	<p>strictly the ruler over the fourth part of a province; but the word denotes a ruler of a province generally ( Matthew 14:1 ;  Luke 3:1 Luke 3:19 ;  9:7 ;  Acts 13:1 ). Herod and Phasael, the sons of Antipater, were the first tetrarchs in Palestine. Herod the tetrarch had the title of king ( Matthew 14:9 ).  </p>
Thaddaeus	<p>breast, the name of one of the apostles ( Mark 3:18 ), called "Lebbaeus" in  Matthew 10:3 , and in  Luke 6:16 , "Judas the brother of James;" while ( John 14:22 ), probably referring to the same person, speaks of "Judas, not Iscariot." These different names all designate the same person, viz., Jude or Judas, the author of the epistle.  </p>
Thahash	<p>a badger, a son of Nahor, Abraham's brother ( Genesis 22:24 ).  </p>
Tharshish	<p>( 1 Kings 10:22 ;  22:48 ). See TARSHISH . </p>
Theatre	<p>only mentioned in  Acts 19:29 Acts 19:31 . The ruins of this theatre at Ephesus still exist, and they show that it was a magnificent structure, capable of accommodating some 56,700 persons. It was the largest structure of the kind that ever existed. Theatres, as places of amusement, were unknown to the Jews.  </p>
Thebez	<p>brightness, a place some 11 miles north-east of Shechem, on the road to Scythopolis, the modern Tabas. Abimelech led his army against this place, because of its participation in the conspiracy of the men of Shechem; but as he drew near to the strong tower to which its inhabitants had fled for safety, and was about to set fire to it, a woman cast a fragment of millstone at him, and "all to brake his skull" i.e., "altogether brake," etc. His armourbearer thereupon "thrust him through, and he died" ( Judges 9:50-55 ).  </p>
Theft	<p>Punished by restitution, the proportions of which are noted in  2 Samuel 12:6 . If the thief could not pay the fine, he was to be sold to a Hebrew master till he could pay ( Exodus 22:1-4 ). A night-thief might be smitten till he died, and there would be no blood-guiltiness for him ( 22:2 ). A man-stealer was to be put to death ( 21:16 ). All theft is forbidden ( Exodus 20:15 ;  21:16 ;  Leviticus 19:11 ;  Deuteronomy 5:19 ;  24:7 ;  Psalms 50:18 ;  Zechariah 5:3 ;  Matthew 19:18 ;  Romans 13:9 ;  Ephesians 4:28 ;  1 Peter 4:15 ).  </p>
Theocracy	<p>a word first used by Josephus to denote that the Jews were under the direct government of God himself. The nation was in all things subject to the will of their invisible King. All the people were the servants of Jehovah, who ruled over their public and private affairs, communicating to them his will through the medium of the prophets. They were the subjects of a heavenly, not of an earthly, king. They were Jehovah's own subjects, ruled directly by him (Compare  1 Samuel 8:6-9 ).  </p>
Theophilus	<p>lover of God, a Christian, probably a Roman, to whom Luke dedicated both his Gospel ( Luke 1:3 ) and the Acts of the Apostles ( 1:1 ). Nothing beyond this is known of him. From the fact that Luke applies to him the title "most excellent", the same title Paul uses in addressing Felix ( Acts 23:26 ;  24:3 ) and Festus ( 26:25 ), it has been concluded that Theophilus was a person of rank, perhaps a Roman officer.  </p>
Thessalonians, Epistles to the	<p>The first epistle to the Thessalonians was the first of all Paul's epistles. It was in all probability written from Corinth, where he abode a "long time" ( Acts 18:11 Acts 18:18 ), early in the period of his residence there, about the end of A.D. 52.  </p><p> The occasion of its being written was the return of Timotheus from Macedonia, bearing tidings from Thessalonica regarding the state of the church there ( Acts 18:1-5 ;  1 Thessalonians 3:6 ). While, on the whole, the report of Timothy was encouraging, it also showed that divers errors and misunderstandings regarding the tenor of Paul's teaching had crept in amongst them. He addresses them in this letter with the view of correcting these errors, and especially for the purpose of exhorting them to purity of life, reminding them that their sanctification was the great end desired by God regarding them.  </p><p> The subscription erroneously states that this epistle was written from Athens. </p><p> The second epistle to the Thessalonians was probably also written from Corinth, and not many months after the first. </p><p> The occasion of the writing of this epistle was the arrival of tidings that the tenor of the first epistle had been misunderstood, especially with reference to the second advent of Christ. The Thessalonians had embraced the idea that Paul had taught that "the day of Christ was at hand", that Christ's coming was just about to happen. This error is corrected ( 2:1-12 ), and the apostle prophetically announces what first must take place. "The apostasy" was first to arise. Various explanations of this expression have been given, but that which is most satisfactory refers it to the Church of Rome.  </p>
Thessalonica	<p>a large and populous city on the Thermaic bay. It was the capital of one of the four Roman districts of Macedonia, and was ruled by a praetor. It was named after Thessalonica, the wife of Cassander, who built the city. She was so called by her father, Philip, because he first heard of her birth on the day of his gaining a victory over the Thessalians. On his second missionary journey, Paul preached in the synagogue here, the chief synagogue of the Jews in that part of Macedonia, and laid the foundations of a church ( Acts 17:1-4 ;  1 Thessalonians 1:9 ). The violence of the Jews drove him from the city, when he fled to Berea ( Acts 17:5-10 ). The "rulers of the city" before whom the Jews "drew Jason," with whom Paul and Silas lodged, are in the original called politarchai, an unusual word, which was found, however, inscribed on an arch in Thessalonica. This discovery confirms the accuracy of the historian. Paul visited the church here on a subsequent occasion ( 20:1-3 ). This city long retained its importance. It is the most important town of European Turkey, under the name of Saloniki, with a mixed population of about 85,000.  </p>
Theudas	<p>thanksgiving, referred to by Gamaliel in his speech before the council at Jerusalem ( Acts 5:36 ). He headed an insurrection against the Roman authority. Beyond this nothing is known of him.  </p>
Thick clay	<p>( Habakkuk 2:6 ) is correctly rendered in the Revised Version "pledges." The Chaldean power is here represented as a rapacious usurer, accumulating the wealth that belonged to others.  </p>
Thieves, The two	<p>( Luke 23:32 Luke 23:39-43 ), robbers, rather brigands, probably followers of Barabbas. Our Lord's cross was placed between those of the "malefactors," to add to the ignominy of his position. According to tradition, Demas or Dismas was the name of the penitent thief hanging on the right, and Gestas of the impenitent on the left.  </p>
Thistle	<p></p><li> Heb. hoah ( 2 Kings 14:9 ;  Job 31:40 ). In  Job 41:2  the Hebrew word is rendered "thorn," but in the Revised Version "hook." It is also rendered "thorn" in  2 Chronicles 33:11 ;  Proverbs 26:9 ; Cant  2:2 ; "brambles" in  Isaiah 34:13 . It is supposed to be a variety of the wild plum-tree, but by some it is regarded as the common thistle, of which there are many varieties in Palestine.  </li><li> Heb. dardar, meaning "a plant growing luxuriantly" ( Genesis 3:18 ;  Hosea 10:8 ); Gr. tribolos, "a triple point" ( Matthew 7:16 ;  Hebrews 6:8 , "brier," RSV "thistle"). This was probably the star-thistle, called by botanists Centaurea calcitropa, or "caltrops," a weed common in corn-fields. (See THORNS .)  </li>
Thomas	<p>twin, one of the twelve ( Matthew 10:3 ;  Mark 3:18 , etc.). He was also called Didymus ( John 11:16 ;  20:24 ), which is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew name. All we know regarding him is recorded in the fourth Gospel ( John 11:15 John 11:16 ;  John 14:4 John 14:5 ;  John 20:24 John 20:25 John 20:26-29 ). From the circumstance that in the lists of the apostles he is always mentioned along with Matthew, who was the son of Alphaeus ( Mark 3:18 ), and that these two are always followed by James, who was also the son of Alphaeus, it has been supposed that these three, Matthew, Thomas, and James, were brothers.  </p>
Thorn	<p></p><li> Heb. hedek ( Proverbs 15:19 ), rendered "brier" in  Micah 7:4 . Some thorny plant, of the Solanum family, suitable for hedges. This is probably the so-called "apple of Sodom," which grows very abundantly in the Jordan valley. "It is a shrubby plant, from 3 to 5 feet high, with very branching stems, thickly clad with spines, like those of the English brier, with leaves very large and woolly on the under side, and thorny on the midriff."  </li><li> Heb. kotz ( Genesis 3:18 ;  Hosea 10:8 ), rendered <i> akantha</i> by the LXX. In the New Testament this word <i> akantha</i> is also rendered "thorns" ( Matthew 7:16 ;  13:7 ;  Hebrews 6:8 ). The word seems to denote any thorny or prickly plant ( Jeremiah 12:13 ). It has been identified with the Ononis spinosa by some.  </li><li> Heb. na'atzutz ( Isaiah 7:19 ;  55:13 ). This word has been interpreted as denoting the Zizyphus spina Christi, or the jujube-tree. It is supposed by some that the crown of thorns placed in wanton cruelty by the Roman soldiers on our Saviour's brow before his crucifixion was plaited of branches of this tree. It overruns a great part of the Jordan valley. It is sometimes called the lotus-tree. "The thorns are long and sharp and recurved, and often create a festering wound." It often grows to a great size. (See CROWN OF  THORNS .) </li><li> Heb. atad ( Psalms 58:9 ) is rendered in the LXX. and Vulgate by Rhamnus, or Lycium Europoeum, a thorny shrub, which is common all over Palestine. From its resemblance to the box it is frequently called the box-thorn.   </li>
Thorn in the flesh	<p>( 2 Corinthians 12:7-10 ). Many interpretations have been given of this passage. </p><li> Roman Catholic writers think that it denotes suggestions to impiety.  </li><li> Luther, Calvin, and other Reformers interpret the expression as denoting temptation to unbelief.  </li><li> Others suppose the expression refers to "a pain in the ear or head," epileptic fits, or, in general, to some severe physical infirmity, which was a hindrance to the apostle in his work (Compare  1 Corinthians 2:3 ;  2 co  10:10 ;  11:30 ;  Galatians 4:13 Galatians 4:14 ;  6:17 ). With a great amount of probability, it has been alleged that his malady was defect of sight, consequent on the dazzling light which shone around him at his conversion, acute opthalmia. This would account for the statements in  Galatians 4:14 ;  2 co.  10:10 ; also  Acts 23:5 , and for his generally making use of the help of an amanuensis (Compare  Romans 16:22 , etc.).  </li><li> Another view which has been maintained is that this "thorn" consisted in an infirmity of temper, to which he occasionally gave way, and which interfered with his success (Compare  Acts 15:39 ;  23:2-5 ). If we consider the fact, "which the experience of God's saints in all ages has conclusively established, of the difficulty of subduing an infirmity of temper, as well as the pain, remorse, and humiliation such an infirmity is wont to cause to those who groan under it, we may be inclined to believe that not the least probable hypothesis concerning the 'thorn' or 'stake' in the flesh is that the loving heart of the apostle bewailed as his sorest trial the misfortune that, by impatience in word, he had often wounded those for whom he would willingly have given his life" (Lias's Second Cor., Introd.).   </li>
Thousands	<p>( Micah 5:2 ), another name for "families" or "clans" (see  Numbers 1:16 ;  10:4 ;  Joshua 22:14 Joshua 22:21 ). Several "thousands" or "families" made up a "tribe."  </p>
Ucal	<p>the name of a person to whom Agur's words are addressed ( Proverbs 30:1 ).  </p>
Ulai	<p>the Eulaus of the Greeks; a river of Susiana. It was probably the eastern branch of the Choasper (Kerkhan), which divided into two branches some 20 miles above the city of Susa. Hence ( Daniel 8:2 Daniel 8:16 ) speaks of standing "between the banks of Ulai", i.e., between the two streams of the divided river.  </p>
Ummah	<p>vicinity, a town of Asher ( Joshua 19:30 ).  </p>
Unction	<p>( 1 John 2:20 1 John 2:27 ; RSV, "anointing"). Kings, prophets, and priests were anointed, in token of receiving divine grace. All believers are, in a secondary sense, what Christ was in a primary sense, "the Lord's anointed."  </p>
Unicorn	<p>described as an animal of great ferocity and strength ( Numbers 23:22 , RSV, "wild ox," marg., "ox-antelope;"  24:8 ;  Isaiah 34:7 , RSV, "wild oxen"), and untamable ( Job 39:9 ). It was in reality a two-horned animal; but the exact reference of the word so rendered (reem) is doubtful. Some have supposed it to be the buffalo; others, the white antelope, called by the Arabs rim. Most probably, however, the word denotes the Bos primigenius ("primitive ox"), which is now extinct all over the world. This was the auerochs of the Germans, and the urus described by Caesar (Gal. Bel., vi.28) as inhabiting the Hercynian forest. The word thus rendered has been found in an Assyrian inscription written over the wild ox or bison, which some also suppose to be the animal intended (Compare  Deuteronomy 33:17 ;  Psalms 22:21 ;  29:6 ;  92:10 ).  </p>
Unni	<p>afficted. </p><li> A Levite whom David appointed to take part in bringing the ark up to Jerusalem from the house of Obed-edom by playing the psaltery on that occasion ( 1 Chronicles 15:18 1 Chronicles 15:20 ).  </li><li> A Levite who returned with Zerubbabel from the Captivity ( Nehemiah 12:9 ).   </li>
Upharsin	<p>and they divide, one of the words written by the mysterious hand on the wall of Belshazzar's palace ( Daniel 5:25 ). It is a pure Chaldean word. "Peres" is only a simple form of the same word.  </p>
Uphaz	<p>probably another name for Ophir ( Jeremiah 10:9 ). Some, however, regard it as the name of an Indian colony in Yemen, southern Arabia; others as a place on or near the river Hyphasis (now the Ghana), the south-eastern limit of the Punjaub.  </p>
Ur	<p>light, or the moon city, a city "of the Chaldees," the birthplace of Haran ( Genesis 11:28 Genesis 11:31 ), the largest city of Shinar or northern Chaldea, and the principal commercial centre of the country as well as the centre of political power. It stood near the mouth of the Euphrates, on its western bank, and is represented by the mounds (of bricks cemented by bitumen) of el-Mugheir, i.e., "the bitumined," or "the town of bitumen," now 150 miles from the sea and some 6 miles from the Euphrates, a little above the point where it receives the Shat el-Hie, an affluent from the Tigris. It was formerly a maritime city, as the waters of the Persian Gulf reached thus far inland. Ur was the port of Babylonia, whence trade was carried on with the dwellers on the gulf, and with the distant countries of India, Ethiopia, and Egypt. It was abandoned about B.C. 500, but long continued, like Erech, to be a great sacred cemetery city, as is evident from the number of tombs found there. (See ABRAHAM .) </p><p> The oldest king of Ur known to us is Ur-Ba'u (servant of the goddess Ba'u), as Hommel reads the name, or Ur-Gur, as others read it. He lived some twenty-eight hundred years B.C., and took part in building the famous temple of the moon-god Sin in Ur itself. The illustration here given represents his cuneiform inscription, written in the Sumerian language, and stamped upon every brick of the temple in Ur. It reads: "Ur-Ba'u, king of Ur, who built the temple of the moon-god." </p><p> "Ur was consecrated to the worship of Sin, the Babylonian moon-god. It shared this honour, however, with another city, and this city was Haran, or Harran. Harran was in Mesopotamia, and took its name from the highroad which led through it from the east to the west. The name is Babylonian, and bears witness to its having been founded by a Babylonian king. The same witness is still more decisively borne by the worship paid in it to the Babylonian moon-god and by its ancient temple of Sin. Indeed, the temple of the moon-god at Harran was perhaps even more famous in the Assyrian and Babylonian world than the temple of the moon-god at Ur. </p><p> "Between Ur and Harran there must, consequently, have been a close connection in early times, the record of which has not yet been recovered. It may be that Harran owed its foundation to a king of Ur; at any rate the two cities were bound together by the worship of the same deity, the closest and most enduring bond of union that existed in the ancient world. That Terah should have migrated from Ur to Harran, therefore, ceases to be extraordinary. If he left Ur at all, it was the most natural place to which to go. It was like passing from one court of a temple into another. </p><p> "Such a remarkable coincidence between the Biblical narrative and the evidence of archaeological research cannot be the result of chance. The narrative must be historical; no writer of late date, even if he were a Babylonian, could have invented a story so exactly in accordance with what we now know to have been the truth. For a story of the kind to have been the invention of Palestinian tradition is equally impossible. To the unprejudiced mind there is no escape from the conclusion that the history of the migration of Terah from Ur to Harran is founded on fact" (Sayce). </p>
Uriah	<p>the Lord is my light. </p><li> A Hittite, the husband of Bathsheba, whom David first seduced, and then after Uriah's death married. He was one of the band of David's "mighty men." The sad story of the curel wrongs inflicted upon him by David and of his mournful death are simply told in the sacred record ( 2 Samuel 11:2-12:26). ). (See BATHSHEBA;  DAVID .) </li><li> A priest of the house of Ahaz ( Isaiah 8:2 ).  </li><li> The father of Meremoth, mentioned in  Ezra 8:33 .   </li>
Uriel	<p>God is my light. </p><li> A Levite of the family of Kohath ( 1 Chronicles 6:24 ).  </li><li> The chief of the Kohathites at the time when the ark was brought up to Jerusalem ( 1 Chronicles 15:5 1 Chronicles 15:11 ).  </li><li> The father of Michaiah, one of Rehoboam's wives, and mother of Abijah ( 2 Chronicles 13:2 ).   </li>
Urijah	<p>the lord is my light. </p><li> A high priest in the time of Ahaz ( 2 Kings 16:10-16 ), at whose bidding he constructed an idolatrous altar like one the king had seen at Damascus, to be set up instead of the brazen altar.  </li><li> One of the priests who stood at the right hand of Ezra's pulpit when he read and expounded the law ( Nehemiah 8:4 ).  </li><li> A prophet of Kirjath-jearim in the reign of Jehoiakim, king of Judah ( Jeremiah 26:20-23 ). He fled into Egypt from the cruelty of the king, but having been brought back he was beheaded and his body "cast into the graves of the common people."   </li>
Vagabond	<p>from Lat. vagabundus, "a wanderer," "a fugitive;" not used opprobriously ( Genesis 4:12 , RSV, "wanderer;"  Psalms 109:10 ;  Acts 19:13 , RSV, "strolling").  </p>
Vajezatha	<p>purity; worthy of honour, one of Haman's sons, whom the Jews slew in the palace of Shushan ( Esther 9:9 ).  </p>
Valley	<p></p><li> Heb. bik'ah, a "cleft" of the mountains ( Deuteronomy 8:7 ;  11:11 ;  Psalms 104:8 ;  Isaiah 41:18 ); also a low plain bounded by mountains, as the plain of Lebanon at the foot of Hermon around the sources of the Jordan ( Joshua 11:17 ;  12:7 ), and the valley of Megiddo ( 2 Chronicles 35:22 ).  </li><li> 'Emek, "deep;" "a long, low plain" ( Job 39:10 Job 39:21 ;  Psalms 65:13 ; Cant  2:1 ), such as the plain of Esdraelon; the "valley of giants" ( Joshua 15:8 ), usually translated "valley of Rephaim" ( 2 Samuel 5:18 ); of Elah ( 1 Samuel 17:2 ), of Berachah ( 2 Chronicles 20:26 ); the king's "dale" ( Genesis 14:17 ); of Jehoshaphat ( Joel 3:2 Joel 3:12 ), of Achor ( Joshua 7:24 ;  Isaiah 65:10 ), Succoth ( Psalms 60:6 ), Ajalon ( Joshua 10:12 ), Jezreel ( Hosea 1:5 ).  </li><li> Ge, "a bursting," a "flowing together," a narrow glen or ravine, such as the valley of the children of Hinnom ( 2 Kings 23:10 ); of Eshcol ( Deuteronomy 1:24 ); of Sorek ( Judges 16:4 ), etc.  <p> The "valley of vision" ( Isaiah 22:1 ) is usually regarded as denoting Jerusalem, which "may be so called," says Barnes (Com. on Isa.), "either (1) because there were several valleys within the city and adjacent to it, as the vale between Mount Zion and Moriah, the vale between Mount Moriah and Mount Ophel, between these and Mount Bezetha, and the valley of Jehoshaphat, the valley of the brook Kidron, etc., without the walls of the city; or (2) more probably it was called the valley in reference to its being compassed with hills rising to a considerable elevation above the city" ( Psalms 125:2 ; Compare also  Jeremiah 21:13 , where Jerusalem is called a "valley").  </p></li><li> Heb. nahal, a wady or water-course ( Genesis 26:19 ; Cant.  6:11 ).   </li>
Vashti	<p>beautiful, the queen of Ahasuerus, who was deposed from her royal dignity because she refused to obey the king when he desired her to appear in the banqueting hall of Shushan the palace ( Esther 1:10-12 ). (See ESTHER .) </p>
Vaticanus, Codex	<p>is said to be the oldest extant vellum manuscript. It and the Codex Sinaiticus are the two oldest uncial manuscripts. They were probably written in the fourth century. The Vaticanus was placed in the Vatican Library at Rome by Pope Nicolas V. in 1448, its previous history being unknown. It originally consisted in all probability of a complete copy of the Septuagint and of the New Testament. It is now imperfect, and consists of 759 thin, delicate leaves, of which the New Testament fills 142. Like the Sinaiticus, it is of the greatest value to Biblical scholars in aiding in the formation of a correct text of the New Testament. It is referred to by critics as Codex B.  </p>
Veil, vail	<p></p><li> Heb. mitpahath ( Ruth 3:15 ; marg., "sheet" or "apron;" RSV, "mantle"). In  Isaiah 3:22  this word is plural, rendered "wimples;" RSV, "shawls" i.e., wraps.  </li><li> Massekah ( Isaiah 25:7 ; in  Isaiah 28:20  rendered "covering"). The word denotes something spread out and covering or concealing something else (Compare  2 Corinthians 3:13-15 ).  </li><li> Masveh ( Exodus 34:33 Exodus 34:35 ), the veil on the face of Moses. This verse should be read, "And when Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face," as in the Revised Version. When Moses spoke to them he was without the veil; only when he ceased speaking he put on the veil (Compare  2 Corinthians 3:13 , etc.).  </li><li> Paroheth ( Exodus 26:31-35 ), the veil of the tabernacle and the temple, which hung between the holy place and the most holy ( 2 Chronicles 3:14 ). In the temple a partition wall separated these two places. In it were two folding-doors, which are supposed to have been always open, the entrance being concealed by the veil which the high priest lifted when he entered into the sanctuary on the day of Atonement. This veil was rent when Christ died on the cross ( Matthew 27:51 ;  Mark 15:38 ;  Luke 23:45 ).  </li><li> Tza'iph ( Genesis 24:65 ). Rebekah "took a vail and covered herself." (See also  Genesis 38:14 Genesis 38:19 .) Hebrew women generally appeared in public without veils ( 12:14 ;  24:16 ;  29:10 ;  1 Samuel 1:12 ).  </li><li> Radhidh (Cant  5:7 , RSV "mantle;"  Isaiah 3:23 ). The word probably denotes some kind of cloak or wrapper.  </li><li> Masak, the veil which hung before the entrance to the holy place ( Exodus 26:36 Exodus 26:37 ).   </li>
Version	<p>a translation of the holy Scriptures. This word is not found in the Bible, nevertheless, as frequent references are made in this work to various ancient as well as modern versions, it is fitting that some brief account should be given of the most important of these. These versions are important helps to the right interpretation of the Word. (See SAMARITAN PENTATEUCH .) </p><p> 1. The Targums. After the return from the Captivity, the Jews, no longer familiar with the old Hebrew, required that their Scriptures should be translated for them into the Chaldaic or Aramaic language and interpreted. These translations and paraphrases were at first oral, but they were afterwards reduced to writing, and thus targums, i.e., "versions" or "translations", have come down to us. The chief of these are, </p><li> The Onkelos Targum, i.e., the targum of Akelas=Aquila, a targum so called to give it greater popularity by comparing it with the Greek translation of Aquila mentioned below. This targum originated about the second century after Christ. </li><li> The targum of Jonathan ben Uzziel comes next to that of Onkelos in respect of age and value. It is more a paraphrase on the Prophets, however, than a translation. Both of these targums issued from the Jewish school which then flourished at Babylon.  <p> 2. The Greek Versions. </p></li><li> The oldest of these is the Septuagint, usually quoted as the LXX. The origin of this the most important of all the versions is involved in much obscurity. It derives its name from the popular notion that seventy-two translators were employed on it by the direction of Ptolemy Philadelphus, king of Egypt, and that it was accomplished in seventy-two days, for the use of the Jews residing in that country. There is no historical warrant for this notion. It is, however, an established fact that this version was made at Alexandria; that it was begun about 280 B.C., and finished about 200 or 150 B.C.; that it was the work of a number of translators who differed greatly both in their knowledge of Hebrew and of Greek; and that from the earliest times it has borne the name of "The Septuagint", i.e., The Seventy.  <p> "This version, with all its defects, must be of the greatest interest, (a) as preserving evidence for the text far more ancient than the oldest Hebrew manuscripts; (b) as the means by which the Greek Language was wedded to Hebrew thought; (c) as the source of the great majority of quotations from the Old Testament by writers of the New Testament. </p></li><li> The New Testament manuscripts fall into two divisions, Uncials, written in Greek capitals, with no distinction at all between the different words, and very little even between the different lines; and Cursives, in small Greek letters, and with divisions of words and lines. The change between the two kinds of Greek writing took place about the tenth century. Only five manuscripts of the New Testament approaching to completeness are more ancient than this dividing date. The first, numbered A, is the Alexandrian manuscript. Though brought to this country by Cyril Lucar, patriarch of Constantinople, as a present to Charles I., it is believed that it was written, not in that capital, but in Alexandria; whence its title. It is now dated in the fifth century A.D. The second, known as B, is the Vatican manuscript. (See VATICANUS .) The Third, C, or the Ephraem manuscript, was so called because it was written over the writings of Ephraem, a Syrian theological author, a practice very common in the days when writing materials were scarce and dear. It is believed that it belongs to the fifth century, and perhaps a slightly earlier period of it than the manuscript A. The fourth, D, or the manuscript of Beza, was so called because it belonged to the reformer Beza, who found it in the monastery of St. Irenaeus at Lyons in 1562 A.D. It is imperfect, and is dated in the sixth century. The fifth (called Aleph) is the Sinaitic manuscript. (See SINAITICUS .) <p> 3. The Syriac Versions. (See SYRIAC .) </p><p> 4. The Latin Versions. A Latin version of the Scriptures, called the "Old Latin," which originated in North Africa, was in common use in the time of Tertullian (A.D. 150). Of this there appear to have been various copies or recensions made. That made in Italy, and called the Itala, was reckoned the most accurate. This translation of the Old Testament seems to have been made not from the original Hebrew but from the LXX.  </p><p> This version became greatly corrupted by repeated transcription, and to remedy the evil Jerome (A.D. 329-420) was requested by Damasus, the bishop of Rome, to undertake a complete revision of it. It met with opposition at first, but was at length, in the seventh century, recognized as the "Vulgate" version. It appeared in a printed from about A.D. 1455, the first book that ever issued from the press. The Council of Trent (1546) declared it "authentic." It subsequently underwent various revisions, but that which was executed (1592) under the sanction of Pope Clement VIII. was adopted as the basis of all subsequent editions. It is regarded as the sacred original in the Roman Catholic Church. All modern European versions have been more or less influenced by the Vulgate. This version reads <i> ipsa_ instead of _ipse</i> in  Genesis 3:15 , "She shall bruise thy head."  </p><p> 5. There are several other ancient versions which are of importance for Biblical critics, but which we need not mention particularly, such as the Ethiopic, in the fourth century, from the LXX.; two Egyptian versions, about the fourth century, the Memphitic, circulated in Lower Egypt, and the Thebaic, designed for Upper Egypt, both from the Greek; the Gothic, written in the German language, but with the Greek alphabet, by Ulphilas (died A.D. 388), of which only fragments of the Old Testament remain; the Armenian, about A.D. 400; and the Slavonic, in the ninth century, for ancient Moravia. Other ancient versions, as the Arabic, the Persian, and the Anglo-Saxon, may be mentioned.  </p><p> 6. The history of the English versions begins properly with Wyckliffe. Portions, however, of the Scriptures were rendered into Saxon (as the Gospel according to John, by Bede, A.D. 735), and also into English (by Orme, called the "Ormulum," a portion of the Gospels and of the Acts in the form of a metrical paraphrase, toward the close of the seventh century), long before Wyckliffe; but it is to him that the honour belongs of having first rendered the whole Bible into English (A.D. 1380). This version was made from the Vulgate, and renders  Genesis 3:15  after that Version, "She shall trede thy head."  </p><p> This was followed by Tyndale's translation (1525-1531); Miles Coverdale's (1535-1553); Thomas Matthew's (1537), really, however, the work of John Rogers, the first martyr under the reign of Queen Mary. This was properly the first Authorized Version, Henry VIII. having ordered a copy of it to be got for every church. This took place in less than a year after Tyndale was martyred for the crime of translating the Scriptures. In 1539 Richard Taverner published a revised edition of Matthew's Bible. The Great Bible, so called from its great size, called also Cranmer's Bible, was published in 1539 and 1568. In the strict sense, the "Great Bible" is "the only authorized version; for the Bishops' Bible and the present Bible [the A.V.] never had the formal sanction of royal authority." Next in order was the Geneva version (1557-1560); the Bishops' Bible (1568); the Rheims and Douai versions, under Roman Catholic auspices (1582,1609); the Authorized Version (1611); and the Revised Version of the New Testament in 1880 and of the Old Testament in 1884.  </p> </li>
Villages	<p>( Judges 5:7 Judges 5:11 ). The Hebrew word thus rendered (perazon) means habitations in the open country, unwalled villages ( Deuteronomy 3:5 ;  1 Samuel 6:18 ). Others, however, following the LXX. and the Vulgate versions, render the word "rulers."  </p>
Vine	<p>one of the most important products of Palestine. The first mention of it is in the history of Noah ( Genesis 9:20 ). It is afterwards frequently noticed both in the Old and New Testaments, and in the ruins of terraced vineyards there are evidences that it was extensively cultivated by the Jews. It was cultivated in Palestine before the Israelites took possession of it. The men sent out by Moses brought with them from the Valley of Eshcol a cluster of grapes so large that "they bare it between two upon a staff" ( Numbers 13: :  23 ). The vineyards of En-gedi (Cant  1:14 ), Heshbon, Sibmah, Jazer, Elealeh ( Isaiah 16:8-10 ;  Jeremiah 48:32 Jeremiah 48:34 ), and Helbon ( Ezekiel 27:18 ), as well as of Eshcol, were celebrated.  </p><p> The Church is compared to a vine ( Psalms 80:8 ), and Christ says of himself, "I am the vine" ( John 15:1 ). In one of his parables also ( Matthew 21:33 ) our Lord compares his Church to a vineyard which "a certain householder planted, and hedged round about," etc.  </p><p> Hosea 10:1  is rendered in the Revised Version, "Israel is a luxuriant vine, which putteth forth his fruit," instead of "Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself," of the Authorized Version.  </p>
Wafers	<p>thin cakes ( Exodus 16:31 ;  Exodus 29:2 Exodus 29:23 ;  Leviticus 2:4 ;  7:12 ;  8:26 ;  Numbers 6:15 Numbers 6:19 ) used in various offerings.  </p>
Wages	<p>Rate of (mention only in  Matthew 20:2 ); to be punctually paid ( Leviticus 19:13 ;  Deuteronomy 24:14 Deuteronomy 24:15 ); judgements threatened against the withholding of ( Jeremiah 22:13 ;  Malachi 3:5 ; Compare  James 5:4 ); paid in money ( Matthew 20:1-14 ); to Jacob in kind ( Genesis 29:15 Genesis 29:20 ;  30:28 ;  Genesis 31:7 Genesis 31:8 Genesis 31:41 ).  </p>
Wagon	<p>Heb. aghalah; so rendered in  Genesis 45:19 Genesis 45:21 Genesis 45:27 ;  46:5 ;  Numbers 7:3 Numbers 7:7 Numbers 7:8 , but elsewhere rendered "cart" ( 1 Samuel 6:7 , etc.). This vehicle was used for peaceful purposes. In  Ezekiel 23:24 , however, it is the rendering of a different Hebrew word, and denotes a war-chariot.  </p>
Wailing-place, Jews	<p>a section of the western wall of the temple area, where the Jews assemble every Friday afternoon to bewail their desolate condition ( Psalms 79:1 Psalms 79:4 Psalms 79:5 ). The stones in this part of the wall are of great size, and were placed, as is generally believed, in the position in which they are now found in the time of Solomon. "The congregation at the wailing-place is one of the most solemn gatherings left to the Jewish Church, and as the writer gazed at the motley concourse he experienced a feeling of sorrow that the remnants of the chosen race should be heartlessly thrust outside the sacred enclosure of their fathers' holy temple by men of an alien race and an alien creed. Many of the elders, seated on the ground, with their backs against the wall, on the west side of the area, and with their faces turned toward the eternal house, read out of their well-thumbed Hebrew books passages from the prophetic writings, such as  Isaiah 64:9-12 " (King's Recent Discoveries, etc.). The wailing-place of the Jews, viewed in its past spiritual and historic relations, is indeed "the saddest nook in this vale of tears." (See LAMENTATIONS, BOOK  OF .) </p>
Wall	<p>Cities were surrounded by walls, as distinguished from "unwalled villages" ( Ezekiel 38:11 ;  Leviticus 25:29-34 ). They were made thick and strong ( Numbers 13:28 ;  Deuteronomy 3:5 ). Among the Jews walls were built of stone, some of those in the temple being of great size ( 1 Kings 6:7 ;  7:9-12 ;  20:30 ;  Mark 13:1 Mark 13:2 ). The term is used metaphorically of security and safety ( Isaiah 26:1 ;  60:18 ;  Revelation 21:12-20 ). (See FENCE .) </p>
Wandering	<p>of the Israelites in the wilderness in consequence of their rebellious fears to enter the Promised Land ( Numbers 14:26-35 ). They wandered for forty years before they were permitted to cross the Jordan ( Joshua 4:19 ;  5:6 ).  </p><p> The record of these wanderings is given in  Numbers 33:1-49 . Many of the stations at which they camped cannot now be identified.  </p><p> Questions of an intricate nature have been discussed regarding the "Wanderings," but it is enough for us to take the sacred narrative as it stands, and rest assured that "He led them forth by the right way" ( Psalms 107:1-7 Psalms 107:33-35 ). (See WILDERNESS .) </p>
War	<p>The Israelites had to take possession of the Promised Land by conquest. They had to engage in a long and bloody war before the Canaanitish tribes were finally subdued. Except in the case of Jericho and Ai, the war did not become aggressive till after the death of Joshua. Till then the attack was always first made by the Canaanites. Now the measure of the iniquity of the Canaanites was full, and Israel was employed by God to sweep them away from off the face of the earth. In entering on this new stage of the war, the tribe of Judah, according to divine direction, took the lead. </p><p> In the days of Saul and David the people of Israel engaged in many wars with the nations around, and after the division of the kingdom into two they often warred with each other. They had to defend themselves also against the inroads of the Egyptians, the Assyrians, and the Babylonians. The whole history of Israel from first to last presents but few periods of peace. </p><p> The Christian life is represented as a warfare, and the Christian graces are also represented under the figure of pieces of armour ( Ephesians 6:11-17 ;  1 Thessalonians 5:8 ;  2 Tim  1 Thessalonians 2:3 1 Thessalonians 2:4 ). The final blessedness of believers is attained as the fruit of victory ( Revelation 3:21 ).  </p>
Ward	<p>a prison ( Genesis 40:3 Genesis 40:4 ); a watch-station ( Isaiah 21:8 ); a guard ( Nehemiah 13:30 ).  </p>
Wars of the Lord, The Book of the	<p>( Numbers 21:14 Numbers 21:15 ), some unknown book so called (Compare  Genesis 14:14-16 ;  Exodus 17:8-16 ;  Numbers 14:40-45 ;  Numbers 21:1-3 Numbers 21:21-25 Numbers 21:33-35 ;  31 . The wars here recorded might be thus designated).  </p>
Washing	<p>( Mark 7:1-9 ). The Jews, like other Orientals, used their fingers when taking food, and therefore washed their hands before doing so, for the sake of cleanliness. Here the reference is to the ablutions prescribed by tradition, according to which "the disciples ought to have gone down to the side of the lake, washed their hands thoroughly, 'rubbing the fist of one hand in the hollow of the other, then placed the ten finger-tips together, holding the hands up, so that any surplus water might flow down to the elbow, and thence to the ground.'" To neglect to do this had come to be regarded as a great sin, a sin equal to the breach of any of the ten commandments. Moses had commanded washings oft, but always for some definite cause; but the Jews multiplied the legal observance till they formed a large body of precepts. To such precepts about ceremonial washing Mark here refers. (See ABLUTION .) </p>
Watches	<p>the periods into which the time between sunset and sunrise was divided. They are so called because watchmen relieved each other at each of these periods. There are frequent references in Scripture to the duties of watchmen who were appointed to give notice of the approach of an enemy ( 2 Samuel 18:24-27 ;  2 Kings  9:17-20 ;  Isaiah 21:5-9 ). They were sometimes placed for this purpose on watch-towers ( 2 Kings 17:9 ;  18:8 ). Ministers or teachers are also spoken of under this title ( Jeremiah 6:17 ; Ezek.  33:2-9 ;  Hebrews 13:17 ).  </p><p> The watches of the night were originally three in number, (1) "the beginning of the watches" ( Lamentations 2:19 ); (2) "the middle watch" ( Judges 7:19 ); and (3) "the morning watch" ( Exodus 14:24 ;  1 Samuel 11:11 ), which extended from two o'clock to sunrise. But in the New Testament we read of four watches, a division probably introduced by the Romans ( Matthew 14:25 ;  Mark 6:48 ;  Luke 12:38 ). (See DAY .) </p>
Watchings	<p>( 2 Corinthians 6:5 ), lit. "sleeplessnesses," the result of "manual labour, teaching, travelling, meditating, praying, cares, and the like" (Meyer's Com.).  </p>
Water of jealousy	<p>a phrase employed (not, however, in Scripture) to denote the water used in the solemn ordeal prescribed by the law of Moses ( Numbers 5:11-31 ) in cases of "jealousy."  </p>
Water of purification	<p>used in cases of ceremonial cleansings at the consecration of the Levites ( Numbers 8:7 ). It signified, figuratively, that purifying of the heart which must characterize the servants of God.  </p>
Water of separation	<p>used along with the ashes of a red heifer for the ceremonial cleansing of persons defiled by contact with a dead body ( Numbers 19 ).  </p>
Waterspouts	<p>( Psalms 42:7 ; marg. RSV, "cataracts"). If we regard this psalm as descriptive of David's feelings when banished from Jerusalem by the revolt of Absalom, this word may denote "waterfalls," inasmuch as Mahanaim, where he abode, was near the Jabbok, and the region abounded with rapids and falls.  </p>
Wave offerings	<p>parts of peace-offerings were so called, because they were waved by the priests ( Exodus 29:24 Exodus 29:26 Exodus 29:27 ;  Leviticus 7:20-34 ;  8:27 ;  9:21 ;  Leviticus 10:14 Leviticus 10:15 , etc.), in token of a solemn special presentation to God. They then became the property of the priests. The first-fruits, a sheaf of barley, offered at the feast of Pentecost ( Leviticus 23:17-20 ), and wheat-bread, the first-fruits of the second harvest, offered at the Passover (10-14), were wave-offerings.  </p>
Wax	<p>Made by melting the combs of bees. Mentioned ( Psalms 22:14 ;  68:2 ;  97:5 ;  Micah 1:4 ) in illustration.  </p>
Wean	<p>Among the Hebrews children (whom it was customary for the mothers to nurse,  Exodus 2:7-9 ;  1 Samuel 1:23 ; Cant  8:1 ) were not generally weaned till they were three or four years old.  </p>
Weasel	<p>(Heb. holedh), enumerated among unclean animals ( Leviticus 11:29 ). Some think that this Hebrew word rather denotes the mole (Spalax typhlus) common in Palestine. There is no sufficient reason, however, to depart from the usual translation. The weasel tribe are common also in Palestine.  </p>
Weaving, weavers	<p>Weaving was an art practised in very early times ( Exodus 35:35 ). The Egyptians were specially skilled in it ( Isaiah 19:9 ; Ezek.  27:7 ), and some have regarded them as its inventors.  </p><p> In the wilderness, the Hebrews practised it ( Exodus 26:1 Exodus 26:8 ;  Exodus 28:4 Exodus 28:39 ;  Leviticus 13:47 ). It is referred to in subsequent times as specially the women's work ( 2 Kings 23:7 ;  Proverbs 31:13 Proverbs 31:24 ). No mention of the loom is found in Scripture, but we read of the "shuttle" ( Job 7:6 ), "the pin" of the beam ( Judges 16:14 ), "the web" (13,14), and "the beam" ( 1 Samuel 17:7 ;  2 Sam  <span class="badLink">21:19</span> ). The rendering, "with pining sickness," in  Isaiah 38:12  (A.V.) should be, as in the Revised Version, "from the loom," or, as in the margin, "from the thrum." We read also of the "warp" and "woof" ( Leviticus 13:48 Leviticus 13:49 Leviticus 13:51-53 Leviticus 13:58 Leviticus 13:59 ), but the Revised Version margin has, instead of "warp," "woven or knitted stuff."  </p>
Week	<p>From the beginning, time was divided into weeks, each consisting of six days of working and one of rest ( Genesis 2:2 Genesis 2:3 ;  7:10 ;  Genesis 8:10 Genesis 8:12 ;  29:28 ). The references to this division of days becomes afterwards more frequent ( Exodus 34:22 ;  Leviticus 12:5 ;  Numbers 28:26 ;  Deuteronomy 16:16 ;  2 Chr  8:13 ;  Jeremiah 5:24 ;  Daniel 9:24-27 ;  Daniel 10:2 Daniel 10:3 ). It has been found to exist among almost all nations.  </p>
Weeks, Feast of	<p>See PENTECOST . </p>
Weights	<p>Reduced to English troy-weight, the Hebrew weights were: </p><li> The gerah ( Leviticus 27:25 ;  Numbers 3:47 ), a Hebrew word, meaning a grain or kernel, and hence a small weight. It was the twentieth part of a shekel, and equal to 12 grains.  </li><li> Bekah ( Exodus 38:26 ), meaning "a half" i.e., "half a shekel," equal to 5 pennyweight.  </li><li> Shekel, "a weight," only in the Old Testament, and frequently in its original form ( Genesis 23:15 Genesis 23:16 ;  Exodus 21:32 ;  Exodus 30:13 Exodus 30:15 ;  38:24-29 , etc.). It was equal to 10 pennyweight.  </li><li> Ma'neh, "a part" or "portion" ( Ezekiel 45:12 ), equal to 60 shekels, i.e., to 2 lbs. 6 oz.  </li><li> Talent of silver ( 2 Kings 5:22 ), equal to 3,000 shekels, i.e., 125 lbs.  </li><li> Talent of gold ( Exodus 25:39 ), double the preceding, i.e., 250 lbs.   </li>
Well	<p>(Heb. beer), to be distinguished from a fountain (Heb. 'ain). A "beer" was a deep shaft, bored far under the rocky surface by the art of man, which contained water which percolated through the strata in its sides. Such wells were those of Jacob and Beersheba, etc. (see  Genesis 21:19 Genesis 21:25 Genesis 21:30 Genesis 21:31 ;  24:11 ;  Genesis 26:15 Genesis 26:18-25 Genesis 26:32 , etc.). In the Pentateuch this word beer, so rendered, occurs twenty-five times.  </p>
Westward	<p>sea-ward, i.e., toward the Mediterranean ( Deuteronomy 3:27 ).  </p>
Whale	<p>The Hebrew word <i> tan</i> (plural, tannin) is so rendered in  Job 7:12  (A.V.; but RSV, "sea-monster"). It is rendered by "dragons" in  Deuteronomy 32:33 ;  Psalms 91:13 ;  Jeremiah 51:34 ;  Psalms 74:13  (marg., "whales;" and marg. of RSV, "sea-monsters");  Isaiah 27:1 ; and "serpent" in  Exodus 7:9  (RSV marg., "any large reptile," and so in ver. 10,12). The words of ( Job 7:12 ), uttered in bitter irony, where he asks, "Am I a sea or a whale?" simply mean, "Have I a wild, untamable nature, like the waves of the sea, which must be confined and held within bounds, that they cannot pass?" "The serpent of the sea, which was but the wild, stormy sea itself, wound itself around the land, and threatened to swallow it up...Job inquires if he must be watched and plagued like this monster, lest he throw the world into disorder" (Davidson's Job).  </p><p> The whale tribe are included under the general Hebrew name <i> tannin</i> ( Genesis 1:21 ;  Lamentations 4:3 ). "Even the sea-monsters [tanninim] draw out the breast." The whale brings forth its young alive, and suckles them.  </p><p> It is to be noticed of the story of Jonah's being "three days and three nights in the whale's belly," as recorded in  Matthew 12:40 , that here the Gr. ketos means properly any kind of sea-monster of the shark or the whale tribe, and that in the book of ( Jonah 1:17 ) it is only said that "a great fish" was prepared to swallow Jonah. This fish may have been, therefore, some great shark. The white shark is known to frequent the Mediterranean Sea, and is sometimes found 30 feet in length.  </p>
Wheat	<p>one of the earliest cultivated grains. It bore the Hebrew name <i> hittah</i> , and was extensively cultivated in Palestine. There are various species of wheat. That which Pharaoh saw in his dream was the Triticum compositum, which bears several ears upon one stalk ( Genesis 41:5 ). The "fat of the kidneys of wheat" ( Deuteronomy 32:14 ), and the "finest of the wheat" ( Psalms 81:16 ;  147:14 ), denote the best of the kind. It was exported from Palestine in great quantities ( 1 Kings 5:11 ;  Ezekiel 27:17 ;  Acts 12:20 ).  </p><p> Parched grains of wheat were used for food in Palestine ( Ruth 2:14 ;  1 Samuel 17:17 ;  2 Sam  17:28 ). The disciples, under the sanction of the Mosaic law ( Deuteronomy 23:25 ), plucked ears of corn, and rubbing them in their hands, ate the grain unroasted ( Matthew 12:1 ;  Mark 2:23 ;  Luke 6:1 ). Before any of the wheat-harvest, however, could be eaten, the first-fruits had to be presented before the Lord ( Leviticus 23:14 ).  </p>
Wheel	<p>(Heb. galgal; rendered "wheel" in  Psalms 83:13 , and "a rolling thing" in  Isaiah 17:13 ; RSV in both, "whirling dust"). This word has been supposed to mean the wild artichoke, which assumes the form of a globe, and in autumn breaks away from its roots, and is rolled about by the wind in some places in great numbers.  </p>
White	<p>a symbol of purity ( 2 Chronicles 5:12 ;  Psalms 51:7 ;  Isaiah 1:18 ;  Revelation 3:18 ;  7:14 ). Our Lord, at his transfiguration, appeared in raiment "white as the light" ( Matthew 17:2 , etc.).  </p>
Widows	<p>to be treated with kindness ( Exodus 22:22 ;  Deuteronomy 14:29 ;  Deuteronomy 16:11 Deuteronomy 16:14 ;  Deuteronomy 24:17 Deuteronomy 24:19-21 ;  26:12 ;  27:19 , etc.). In the New Testament the same tender regard for them is inculcated ( Acts 6:1-6 ;  1 Timothy 5:3-16 ) and exhibited.  </p>
Wife	<p>The ordinance of marriage was sanctioned in Paradise ( Genesis 2:24 ;  Matthew 19:4-6 ). Monogamy was the original law under which man lived, but polygamy early commenced ( Genesis 4:19 ), and continued to prevail all down through Jewish history. The law of Moses regulated but did not prohibit polygamy. A man might have a plurality of wives, but a wife could have only one husband. A wife's legal rights ( Exodus 21:10 ) and her duties ( Proverbs 31:10-31 ;  1 Timothy 5:14 ) are specified. She could be divorced in special cases ( Deuteronomy 22:13-21 ), but could not divorce her husband. Divorce was restricted by our Lord to the single case of adultery ( Matthew 19:3-9 ). The duties of husbands and wives in their relations to each other are distinctly set forth in the New Testament ( 1 Corinthians 7:2-5 ;  Ephesians 5:22-33 ;  Colossians 3:18 Colossians 3:19 ;  1 Peter 3:1-7 ).  </p>
Yarn	<p>Found only in 1Kings  1 Kings 1:16 . The Heb. word mikveh, i.e., "a stringing together," so rendered, rather signifies a host, or company, or a string of horses. The Authorized Version has: "And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price;" but the Revised Version correctly renders: "And the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; the king's merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price."  </p>
Year	<p>Heb. shanah, meaning "repetition" or "revolution" ( Genesis 1:14 ;  5:3 ). Among the ancient Egyptians the year consisted of twelve months of thirty days each, with five days added to make it a complete revolution of the earth round the sun. The Jews reckoned the year in two ways, (1) according to a sacred calendar, in which the year began about the time of the vernal equinox, with the month Abib; and (2) according to a civil calendar, in which the year began about the time of the autumnal equinox, with the month Nisan. The month Tisri is now the beginning of the Jewish year.  </p>
Yeshebi	<p>the Hebrew word rendered "inhabitants" in  Joshua 17:7 , but probably rather the name of the village Yeshepheh, probably Yassuf, 8 miles south of Shechem.  </p>
Zaanaim	<p>wanderings; the unloading of tents, so called probably from the fact of nomads in tents encamping amid the cities and villages of that region, a place in the north-west of Lake Merom, near Kedesh, in Naphtali. Here Sisera was slain by Jael, "the wife of Heber the Kenite," who had pitched his tent in the "plain [RSV, 'as far as the oak'] of Zaanaim" ( Judges 4:11 ).  </p><p> It has been, however, suggested by some that, following the LXX. and the Talmud, the letter b, which in Hebrew means "in," should be taken as a part of the word following, and the phrase would then be "unto the oak of Bitzanaim," a place which has been identified with the ruins of Bessum, about half-way between Tiberias and Mount Tabor. </p>
Zaanan	<p>place of flocks, mentioned only in  Micah 1:11 . It may be identified with Zenan, in the plain country of Judah ( Joshua 15:37 ).  </p>
Zaanannim	<p>=Zaanaim, ( Joshua 19:33 ).  </p>
Zaavan	<p>terror, one of the "dukes of Edom" ( Genesis 36:27 ); called also Zavan ( 1 Chronicles 1:42 ).  </p>
Zabad	<p>gift. </p><li> One of David's valiant men ( 1 Chronicles 11:41 ), the descendant of Ahlai, of the "children of Sheshan" ( 2:31 ).  </li><li> A descendant of Tahath ( 7:21 ).  </li><li> The son of Shemath. He conspired against Joash, king of Judah, and slew him ( 2 Chronicles 24:25 2 Chronicles 24:26 ). He is called also Jozachar ( 2 Kings 12:21 ).  </li><li> Ezra 10:27 .  </li><li> Ezra 10:33 .  </li><li> Ezra 10:43 .   </li>
Zabbai	<p>wanderer; pure. </p><li> Ezra 10:28 .  </li><li> The father of Baruch, who "earnestly repaired" part of the wall of Jerusalem ( Nehemiah 3:20 ; marg., "Zaccai").   </li>
Zabbud	<p>gift,  Ezra 8:14 .  </p>
Zabdi	<p>gift of Jehovah. </p><li> An ancestor of Achan ( Joshua 7:1 Joshua 7:17 Joshua 7:18 ). He is probably the "Zimri" of  1 Chronicles 2:6 .  </li><li> A Benjamite ( 1 Chronicles 8:19 ).  </li><li> Called "the Shiphmite," one of David's officers, who had charge of his vineyards ( 1 Chronicles 27:27 ).  </li><li> A Levite, one of the sons of Asaph ( Nehemiah 11:17 ); probably the same as Zichri ( 1 Chronicles 9:15 ), and Zaccur ( Nehemiah 12:35 ).   </li>
Zabdiel	<p>gift of God. </p><li> The father of Jashobeam, who was one of David's officers ( 1 Chronicles 27:2 ).  </li><li> An overseer of the priests after the Captivity ( Nehemiah 11:14 ).   </li>
Zabud	<p>gift, the son of Nathan, who was "king's friend" in the court of Solomon ( 1 Kings 4:5 ).  </p>
Zabulon	<p>( Matthew 4:13 Matthew 4:15 ;  Revelation 7:8 ). See ZEBULUN . </p>
Zaccai	<p>pure, one whose "sons" returned with Zerubbabel to Jerusalem ( Ezra 2:9 ;  Nehemiah 7:14 ). (See ZABBAI .) </p>
Zacchaeus	<p>pure, a superintendant of customs; a chief tax-gather (publicanus) at Jericho ( Luke 19:1-10 ). "The collection of customs at Jericho, which at this time produced and exported a considerable quantity of balsam, was undoubtedly an important post, and would account for Zacchaeus being a rich man." Being short of stature, he hastened on before the multitude who were thronging about Christ as he passed through Jericho on his way to Jerusalem, and climbed up a sycamore tree that he might be able to see him. When our Lord reached the spot he looked up to the publican among the branches, and addressing him by name, told him to make haste and come down, as he intended that day to abide at his house. This led to the remarkable interview recorded by the evangelist, and to the striking parable of the ten pounds ( Luke 19:12-27 ). At Er-riha (Jericho) there is a large, venerable looking square tower, which goes by the traditional name of the House of Zacchaeus.  </p>
Zaccur	<p>mindful. </p><li> Father of Shammua, who was one of the spies sent out by Moses ( Numbers 13:4 ).  </li><li> A Merarite Levite ( 1 Chronicles 24:27 ).  </li><li> A son of Asaph, and chief of one of the courses of singers as arranged by David ( 1 Chronicles 25:2 1 Chronicles 25:10 ).  </li><li> Son of Imri ( Nehemiah 3:2 ).  </li><li> A Levite ( Nehemiah 10:12 ).  </li><li> The son of Mattaniah ( Nehemiah 13:13 ).   </li>
Zachariah	<p>remembered by the Lord. </p><li> Son of Jeroboam II., king of Israel. On the death of his father there was an interregnum of ten years, at the end of which he succeeded to the throne, which he occupied only six months, having been put to death by Shallum, who usurped the throne. "He did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as his fathers had done" ( 2 Kings 14:29 ;  15:8-12 ). In him the dynasty of Jehu came to an end.  </li><li> The father of Abi, who was the mother of Hezekiah ( 2 Kings 18:2 ).   </li>
Zacharias	<p></p><li> A priest of the course of Abia, the eighth of the twenty-four courses into which the priests had been originally divided by David ( 1 Chronicles 23:1-19 ). Only four of these courses or "families" of the priests returned from the Exile ( Ezra 2:36-39 ); but they were then re-distributed under the old designations. The priests served at the temple twice each year, and only for a week each time. Zacharias's time had come for this service. During this period his home would be one of the chambers set apart for the priests on the sides of the temple ground. The offering of incense was one of the most solemn parts of the daily worship of the temple, and lots were drawn each day to determine who should have this great honour, an honour which no priest could enjoy more than once during his lifetime.  <p> While Zacharias ministered at the golden altar of incense in the holy place, it was announced to him by the angel Gabriel that his wife Elisabeth, who was also of a priestly family, now stricken in years, would give birth to a son who was to be called John, and that he would be the forerunner of the long-expected Messiah ( Luke 1:12-17 ). As a punishment for his refusing to believe this message, he was struck dumb and "not able to speak until the day that these things should be performed" (20). Nine months passed away, and Elisabeth's child was born, and when in answer to their inquiry Zacharias wrote on a "writing tablet," "His name is John," his mouth was opened, and he praised God (60-79). The child (John the Baptist), thus "born out of due time," "waxed strong in spirit" ( 1:80 ).  </p></li><li> The "son of Barachias," mentioned as having been slain between the temple and the altar ( Matthew 23:35 ;  Luke 11:51 ). "Barachias" here may be another name for Jehoiada, as some think. (See ZECHARIAH .)  </li>
Zacher	<p>memorial, a son of Jehiel ( 1 Chronicles 8:31 ;  9:35 ); called ( Zechariah 9:37 ).  </p>
Zadok	<p>righteous. </p><li> A son of Ahitub, of the line of Eleazer ( 2 Samuel 8:17 ;  1 Chronicles 24:3 ), high priest in the time of David ( 2 Samuel 20:25 ) and Solomon ( 1 Kings 4:4 ). He is first mentioned as coming to take part with David at Hebron ( 1 Chronicles 12:27 1 Chronicles 12:28 ). He was probably on this account made ruler over the Aaronites ( 27:17 ). Zadok and Abiathar acted as high priests on several important occasions ( 1 Chronicles 15:11 ;  2 Sam  1 Chronicles 15:24-29 <span class="badLink">1 Chronicles 15:35</span> <span class="badLink">1 Chronicles 15:36</span> ); but when Adonijah endeavoured to secure the throne, Abiathar went with him, and therefore Solomon "thrust him out from being high priest," and Zadok, remaining faithful to David, became high priest alone ( 1 Kings 2:27 1 Kings 2:35 ;  1 Chronicles 29:22 ). In him the line of Phinehas resumed the dignity, and held it till the fall of Jerusalem. He was succeeded in his sacred office by his son Azariah ( 1 Kings 4:2 ; Compare  1 Chronicles 6:3-9 ).  </li><li> The father of Jerusha, who was wife of King Uzziah, and mother of King Jotham ( 2 Kings 15:33 ;  2 Chr  <span class="badLink">27:1</span> ).  </li><li> "The scribe" set over the treasuries of the temple by Nehemiah along with a priest and a Levite ( Nehemiah 13:13 ).  </li><li> The sons of Baana, one of those who assisted in rebuilding the wall of Jerusalem ( Nehemiah 3:4 ).   </li>
Zair	<p>little, a place probably east of the Dead Sea, where Joram discomfited the host of Edom who had revolted from him ( 2 Kings 8:21 ).  </p>
Zalmon	<p>shady. </p><li> One of David's warriors, called the Ahohite ( 2 Samuel 23:28 ); called also Ilai ( 1 Chronicles 11:29 ).  </li><li> A wood near Shechem, from which Abimelech and his party brought boughs and "put them to the hold" of Shechem, "and set the hold on fire" ( Judges 9:48 ). Probably the southern peak of Gerizim, now called Jebel Sulman. (See SALMON .)  </li>
Zalmonah	<p>shady, one of the stations of the Israelites in the wilderness ( Numbers 33:41 Numbers 33:42 ).  </p>
Zalmunna	<p>one of the two kings of Midian whom the "Lord delivered" into the hands of Gideon. He was slain afterwards with Zebah (Judg.  8:5-21 ). (See ZEBAH .) </p>
Zamzummims	<p>a race of giants; "a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims" ( Deuteronomy 2:20 Deuteronomy 2:21 ). They were overcome by the Ammonites, "who called them Zamzummims." They belonged to the Rephaim, and inhabited the country afterwards occupied by the Ammonites. It has been conjectured that they might be Ham-zuzims, i.e., Zuzims dwelling in Ham, a place apparently to the south of Ashteroth ( Genesis 14:5 ), the ancient Rabbath-ammon.  </p>
Zanoah	<p>marsh. </p><li> A town in the low country or shephelah of Judah, near Zorah ( Joshua 15:34 ). It was re-occupied after the return from the Captivity ( Nehemiah 11:30 ). Zanu'ah in Wady Ismail, 10 miles west of Jerusalem, occupies probably the same site.  </li><li> A town in the hill country of Judah, some 10 miles to the south-west of Hebron ( Joshua 15:56 ).   </li>
Zaphnath-paaneah	<p>the name which Pharaoh gave to Joseph when he raised him to the rank of prime minister or grand vizier of the kingdom ( Genesis 41:45 ). This is a pure Egyptian word, and has been variously explained. Some think it means "creator," or "preserver of life." Brugsch interprets it as "governor of the district of the place of life", i.e., of Goshen, the chief city of which was Pithom, "the place of life." Others explain it as meaning "a revealer of secrets," or "the man to whom secrets are revealed."  </p>
Zarephath	<p>smelting-shop, "a workshop for the refining and smelting of metals", a small Phoenician town, now Surafend, about a mile from the coast, almost midway on the road between Tyre and Sidon. Here Elijah sojourned with a poor widow during the "great famine," when the "heaven was shut up three years and six months" ( Luke 4:26 ;  1 Kings 17:10 ). It is called Sarepta in the New Testament ( Luke 4:26 ).  </p>
Zaretan	<p>When the Hebrews crossed the Jordan, as soon as the feet of the priests were dipped in the water, the flow of the stream was arrested. The point of arrest was the "city of Adam beside Zaretan," probably near Succoth, at the mouth of the Jabbok, some 30 miles up the river from where the people were encamped. There the water "stood and rose upon an heap." Thus the whole space of 30 miles of the river-bed was dry, that the tribes might pass over ( Joshua 3:16 Joshua 3:17 ; Compare  Psalms 104:3 ).  </p>
Zareth-shahar	<p>the splendour of the dawn, a city "in the mount of the valley" ( Joshua 13:19 ). It is identified with the ruins of Zara, near the mouth of the Wady Zerka Main, on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea, some 3 miles south of the Callirrhoe. Of this town but little remains. "A few broken basaltic columns and pieces of wall about 200 yards back from the shore, and a ruined fort rather nearer the sea, about the middle of the coast line of the plain, are all that are left" (Tristram's Land of Moab).  </p>
Zarthan	<p>a place near Succoth, in the plain of the Jordan, "in the clay ground," near which Hiram cast the brazen utensils for the temple ( 1 Kings 7:46 ); probably the same as Zartan. It is also called Zeredathah ( 2 Chronicles 4:17 ). (See ZEREDA .) </p>
Zatthu	<p>a sprout,  Nehemiah 10:14 .  </p>
Zattu	<p>id., one whose descendants returned from the Captivity with Zerubbabel ( Ezra 2:8 ;  Nehemiah 7:13 ); probably the same as Zatthu.  </p>
Zaza	<p>plenty, a descendant of Judah ( 1 Chronicles 2:33 ).  </p>
Zeal	<p>an earnest temper; may be enlightened ( Numbers 25:11-13 ;  2 co.  7:11 ;  9:2 ), or ignorant and misdirected ( Romans 10:2 ; Phil  3:6 ). As a Christian grace, it must be grounded on right principles and directed to right ends ( Galatians 4:18 ). It is sometimes ascribed to God ( 2 Kings 19:31 ;  Isaiah 9:7 ;  37:32 ;  Ezekiel 5:13 ).  </p>
Zealots	<p>a sect of Jews which originated with Judas the Gaulonite ( Acts 5:37 ). They refused to pay tribute to the Romans, on the ground that this was a violation of the principle that God was the only king of Israel. They rebelled against the Romans, but were soon scattered, and became a lawless band of mere brigands. They were afterwards called Sicarii, from their use of the sica, i.e., the Roman dagger.  </p>
Zebadiah	<p>gift of Jehovah. </p><li> A son of Asahel, Joab's brother ( 1 Chronicles 27:7 ).  </li><li> A Levite who took part as one of the teachers in the system of national education instituted by Jehoshaphat ( 2 Chronicles 17:7 2 Chronicles 17:8 ).  </li><li> The son of Ishmael, "the ruler of the house of Judah in all the king's matters" ( 2 Chronicles 19:8-11 ).  </li><li> A son of Beriah ( 1 Chronicles 8:15 ).  </li><li> A Korhite porter of the Lord's house ( 1 Chronicles 26:2 ). Three or four others of this name are also mentioned.   </li>
Zebah	<p>man-killer, or sacrifice, one of the two kings who led the vast host of the Midianites who invaded the land of Israel, and over whom Gideon gained a great and decisive victory (Judg. 8). Zebah and Zalmunna had succeeded in escaping across the Jordan with a remnant of the Midianite host, but were overtaken at Karkor, probably in the Hauran, and routed by Gideon. The kings were taken alive and brought back across the Jordan; and confessing that they had personally taken part in the slaughter of Gideon's brothers, they were put to death (Compare  1 Samuel 12:11 ;  Isaiah 10:26 ;  Psalms 83:11 ).  </p>
Zebaim	<p>( Ezra 2:57 ;  Nehemiah 7:59 ). "Pochereth of Zebaim" should be read as in the Revised Version, "Pochereth-hazzebaim" ("snaring the antelopes"), probably the name of some hunter.  </p>
Zebedee	<p>a Galilean fisherman, the husband of Salome (q.v.), and the father of James and John, two of our Lord's disciples ( Matthew 4:21 ;  27:56 ;  Mark 15:40 ). He seems to have been a man of some position in Capernaum, for he had two boats ( Luke 5:4 ) and "hired servants" ( Mark 1:20 ) of his own. No mention is made of him after the call of his two sons by Jesus.  </p>
Zeboim	<p>gazelles or roes. </p><li> One of the "five cities of the plain" of Sodom, generally coupled with Admah ( Genesis 10:19 ;  14:2 ;  Deuteronomy 29:23 ;  Hosea 11:8 ). It had a king of its own (Shemeber), and was therefore a place of some importance. It was destroyed along with the other cities of the plain.  </li><li> A valley or rugged glen somewhere near Gibeah in Benjamin ( 1 Samuel 13:18 ). It was probably the ravine now bearing the name Wady Shakh-ed-Dub'a, or "ravine of the hyena," north of Jericho.  </li><li> A place mentioned only in  Nehemiah 11:34 , inhabited by the Benjamites after the Captivity.   </li>
Zebudah	<p>given, the wife of Josiah and mother of Jehoiakim ( 2 Kings 23:36 ).  </p>
Zebul	<p>habitation, the governor of Shechem under Abimelech ( Judges 9:28 Judges 9:30 Judges 9:36 ). He informed his master of the intention of the people of Shechem to transfer their allegiance to the Hivite tribe of Hamor. This led to Abimelech's destroying the city, when he put its entire population to the sword, and sowed the ruins with salt ( Judges 9:28-45 ).  </p>
Zebulonite	<p>the designation of Elon, the judge who belonged to the tribe of Zebulun ( Judges 12:11 Judges 12:12 ).  </p>
Zebulun	<p>dwelling, the sixth and youngest son of Jacob and Leah ( Genesis 30:20 ). Little is known of his personal history. He had three sons ( 46:14 ).  </p>
Zebulun, Lot of	<p>in Galilee, to the north of Issachar and south of Asher and Naphtali ( Joshua 19:10-16 ), and between the Sea of Galilee and the Mediterranean. According to ancient prophecy this part of Galilee enjoyed a large share of our Lord's public ministry ( Isaiah 9:1 Isaiah 9:2 ;  Matthew 4:12-16 ).  </p>
Zebulun, Tribe of	<p>numbered at Sinai ( Numbers 1:31 ) and before entering Canaan ( 26:27 ). It was one of the tribes which did not drive out the Canaanites, but only made them tributary ( Judges 1:30 ). It took little interest in public affairs. It responded, however, readily to the summons of Gideon ( 6:35 ), and afterwards assisted in enthroning David at Hebron ( 1 Chronicles 12:33 1 Chronicles 12:40 ). Along with the other northern tribes, Zebulun was carried away into the land of Assyria by Tiglath-pileser ( 2 Kings 15:29 ).  </p><p> In Deborah's song the words, "Out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer" ( Judges 5:14 ) has been rendered in the RSV, "They that handle the marshal's staff." This is a questionable rendering. "The word <i> sopher</i> ('scribe' or 'writer') defines the word <i> shebhet</i> ('rod' or 'pen') with which it is conjoined. The 'rod of the scribe' on the Assyrian monuments was the stylus of wood or metal, with the help of which the clay tablet was engraved, or the papyrus inscribed with characters. The scribe who wielded it was the associate and assistant of the 'lawgivers.'" (Sayce). </p>
Zechariah	<p>Jehovah is renowned or remembered. </p><li> A prophet of Judah, the eleventh of the twelve minor prophets. Like Ezekiel, he was of priestly extraction. He describes himself ( 1:1 ) as "the son of Berechiah." In  Ezra 5:1  and  6:14  he is called "the son of Iddo," who was properly his grandfather. His prophetical career began in the second year of Darius (B.C. 520), about sixteen years after the return of the first company from exile. He was contemporary with Haggai ( Ezra 5:1 ).  <p> His book consists of two distinct parts, (1) chapters 1 to 8, inclusive, and (2) 9 to the end. It begins with a preface ( 1:1-6 ), which recalls the nation's past history, for the purpose of presenting a solemn warning to the present generation. Then follows a series of eight visions ( (1:7-6:8), ), succeeding one another in one night, which may be regarded as a symbolical history of Israel, intended to furnish consolation to the returned exiles and stir up hope in their minds. The symbolical action, the crowning of ( Joshua 6:9-15 ), describes how the kingdoms of the world become the kingdom of God's Christ.  </p><p> Chapters 7 and 8, delivered two years later, are an answer to the question whether the days of mourning for the destruction of the city should be any longer kept, and an encouraging address to the people, assuring them of God's presence and blessing.  </p><p> The second part of the book (ch. 9-14) bears no date. It is probable that a considerable interval separates it from the first part. It consists of two burdens.  </p><p> The first burden (ch. 9-11) gives an outline of the course of God's providential dealings with his people down to the time of the Advent.  </p><p> The second burden (ch. 12-14) points out the glories that await Israel in "the latter day", the final conflict and triumph of God's kingdom.  </p></li><li> The son or grandson of Jehoiada, the high priest in the times of Ahaziah and Joash. After the death of Jehoiada he boldly condemned both the king and the people for their rebellion against God ( 2 Chronicles 24:20 ), which so stirred up their resentment against him that at the king's commandment they stoned him with stones, and he died "in the court of the house of the Lord" ( 24:21 ). Christ alludes to this deed of murder in  Matthew 23:35 ,  Luke 11:51 . (See ZACHARIAS [2].)  </li><li> A prophet, who had "understanding in the seeing of God," in the time of Uzziah, who was much indebted to him for his wise counsel ( 2 Chronicles 26:5 ).  <p> Besides these, there is a large number of persons mentioned in Scripture bearing this name of whom nothing is known. </p></li><li> One of the chiefs of the tribe of Reuben ( 1 Chronicles 5:7 ).  </li><li> One of the porters of the tabernacle ( 1 Chronicles 9:21 ).  </li><li> 1 Chronicles 9:37 .  </li><li> A Levite who assisted at the bringing up of the ark from the house of Obededom ( 1 Chronicles 15:20-24 ).  </li><li> A Kohathite Levite ( 1 Chronicles 24:25 ).  </li><li> A Merarite Levite ( 1 Chronicles 27:21 ).  </li><li> The father of Iddo ( 1 Chronicles 27:21 ).  </li><li> One who assisted in teaching the law to the people in the time of Jehoshaphat ( 2 Chronicles 17:7 ).  </li><li> A Levite of the sons of Asaph ( 2 Chronicles 20:14 ).  </li><li> One of Jehoshaphat's sons ( 2 Chronicles 21:2 ).  </li><li> The father of Abijah, who was the mother of Hezekiah ( 2 Chronicles 29:1 ).  </li><li> One of the sons of Asaph ( 2 Chronicles 29:13 ).  </li><li> One of the "rulers of the house of God" ( 2 Chronicles 35:8 ).  </li><li> A chief of the people in the time of Ezra, who consulted him about the return from captivity ( Ezra 8:16 ); probably the same as mentioned in  Nehemiah 8:4 ,  </li><li> Nehemiah 11:12 .  </li><li> Nehemiah 12:16 .  </li><li> Nehemiah 12:35 Nehemiah 12:41 .  </li><li> Isaiah 8:2 .   </li>
Zedad	<p>side; sloping place, a town in the north of Palestine, near Hamath ( Numbers 34:8 ;  Ezekiel 47:15 ). It has been identified with the ruins of Sudud, between Emesa (Hums) and Baalbec, but that is uncertain.  </p>
Zedekiah	<p>righteousness of Jehovah. </p><li> The last king of Judah. He was the third son of Josiah, and his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah, and hence he was the brother of Jehoahaz ( 2 Kings 23:31 ;  2 Kings 24:17 2 Kings 24:18 ). His original name was Mattaniah; but when Nebuchadnezzar placed him on the throne as the successor to Jehoiachin he changed his name to Zedekiah. The prophet Jeremiah was his counsellor, yet "he did evil in the sight of the Lord" ( 2 Kings 24:19 2 Kings 24:20 ;  Jeremiah 52:2 Jeremiah 52:3 ). He ascended the throne at the age of twenty-one years. The kingdom was at that time tributary to Nebuchadnezzar; but, despite the strong remonstrances of Jeremiah and others, as well as the example of Jehoiachin, he threw off the yoke of Babylon, and entered into an alliance with Hophra, king of Egypt. This brought up Nebuchadnezzar, "with all his host" (2King  25:1 ), against Jerusalem. During this siege, which lasted about eighteen months, "every worst woe befell the devoted city, which drank the cup of God's fury to the dregs" ( 2 Kings 25:3 ;  Lamentations 4:4 Lamentations 4:5 Lamentations 4:10 ). The city was plundered and laid in ruins. Zedekiah and his followers, attempting to escape, were made captive and taken to Riblah. There, after seeing his own children put to death, his own eyes were put out, and, being loaded with chains, he was carried captive (B.C. 588) to Babylon ( 2 Kings 25:1-7 ;  2 Chr  <span class="badLink">36:12</span> ;  Jeremiah 32:4 Jeremiah 32:5 ;  Jeremiah 34:2 Jeremiah 34:3 ;  39:1-7 ;  52:4-11 ;  Ezekiel 12:12 ), where he remained a prisoner, how long is unknown, to the day of his death.  <p> After the fall of Jerusalem, Nebuzaraddan was sent to carry out its complete destruction. The city was razed to the ground. Only a small number of vinedressers and husbandmen were permitted to remain in the land ( Jeremiah 52:16 ). Gedaliah, with a Chaldean guard stationed at Mizpah, ruled over Judah ( 2 Kings 25:22 2 Kings 25:24 ;  Jeremiah 40:1 Jeremiah 40:2 Jeremiah 40:5 Jeremiah 40:6 ).  </p></li><li> The son of Chenaanah, a false prophet in the days of Ahab ( 1 Kings 22:11 1 Kings 22:24 ;  2 Chr  1 Kings 18:10 1 Kings 18:23 ).  </li><li> The son of Hananiah, a prince of Judah in the days of Jehoiakim ( Jeremiah 36:12 ).   </li>
Zeeb	<p>the wolf, one of the two leaders of the great Midianite host which invaded Israel and was utterly routed by Gideon. The division of that host, which attempted to escape across the Jordan, under Oreb and Zeeb, was overtaken by the Ephraimites, who, in a great battle, completely vanquished them, their leaders being taken and slain ( Judges 7:25 ;  Psalms 83:11 ;  Isaiah 10:26 ).  </p>
Zelah	<p>slope; side, a town in Benjamin, where Saul and his son Jonathan were buried ( 2 Samuel 21:14 ). It was probably Saul's birthplace.  </p>
Zelek	<p>cleft, an Ammonite; one of David's valiant men ( 2 Samuel 23:37 ).  </p>
Zelophehad	<p>first-born, of the tribe of Manasseh, and of the family of Gilead; died in the wilderness. Having left no sons, his daughters, concerned lest their father's name should be "done away from among his family," made an appeal to Moses, who, by divine direction, appointed it as "a statute of judgment" in Israel that daughters should inherit their father's portion when no sons were left ( Numbers 27:1-11 ). But that the possession of Zelophehad might not pass away in the year of jubilee from the tribe to which he belonged, it was ordained by Moses that his daughters should not marry any one out of their father's tribe; and this afterwards became a general law ( Numbers 36 ).  </p>
