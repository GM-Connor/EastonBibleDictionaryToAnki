Amasa	<p>burden. </p><li> The son of Abigail, a sister of king David ( 1 Chronicles 2:17 ;  2 Sam  17:25 ). He was appointed by David to command the army in room of his cousin Joab ( 2 Samuel 19:13 ), who afterwards treacherously put him to death as a dangerous rival ( 2 Samuel 20:4-12 ).  </li><li> A son of Hadlai, and chief of Ephraim ( 2 Chronicles 28:12 ) in the reign of Ahaz.   </li>
Amasai	<p>burdensome. </p><li> A Levite, son of Elkanah, of the ancestry of Samuel ( 1 Chronicles 6:25 1 Chronicles 6:35 ).  </li><li> The leader of a body of men who joined David in the "stronghold," probably of Adullam ( 1 Chronicles 12:18 ).  </li><li> One of the priests appointed to precede the ark with blowing of trumpets on its removal from the house of Obed-edom ( 1 Chronicles 15:24 ).  </li><li> The father of a Levite, one of the two Kohathites who took a prominent part at the instance of Hezekiah in the cleansing of the temple ( 2 Chronicles 29:12 ).   </li>
Amashai	<p>the son of Azareel, appointed by Nehemiah to reside at Jerusalem and do the work of the temple ( Nehemiah 11:13 ).  </p>
Amasiah	<p>burden of (i.e., "sustained by") Jehovah, the "son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto the Lord," a captain over thousands under Jehoshaphat ( 2 Chronicles 17:16 ; Compare  Judges 5:9 ).  </p>
Amaziah	<p>strengthened by Jehovah. </p><li> A Levite, son of Hilkiah, of the descendants of Ethan the Merarite ( 1 Chronicles 6:45 ).  </li><li> The son and successor of Joash, and eighth king of the separate kingdom of Judah ( 2 Kings 14:1-4 ). He began his reign by punishing the murderers of his father (5-7;  2 Chronicles 25:3-5 ). He was the first to employ a mercenary army of 100,000 Israelite soldiers, which he did in his attempt to bring the Edomites again under the yoke of Judah ( 2 Chronicles 25:5 2 Chronicles 25:6 ). He was commanded by a prophet of the Lord to send back the mercenaries, which he did ( 2 Chronicles 25:7-10 2 Chronicles 25:13 ), much to their annoyance. His obedience to this command was followed by a decisive victory over the Edomites ( 2 Chronicles 25:14-16 ). Amaziah began to worship some of the idols he took from the Edomites, and this was his ruin, for he was vanquished by Joash, king of Israel, whom he challenged to battle. The disaster he thus brought upon Judah by his infatuation in proclaiming war against Israel probably occasioned the conspiracy by which he lost his life ( 2 Kings 14:8-14 2 Kings 14:19 ). He was slain at Lachish, whither he had fled, and his body was brought upon horses to Jerusalem, where it was buried in the royal sepulchre ( 2 Kings 14:19 2 Kings 14:20 ;  2 Chr  2 Kings 25:27 2 Kings 25:28 ).  </li><li> A priest of the golden calves at Bethel ( Amos 7:10-17 ).  </li><li> The father of Joshah, one of the Simeonite chiefs in the time of Hezekiah ( 1 Chronicles 4:34 ).   </li>
Ambassador	<p>In the Old Testament the Hebrew word <i> tsir</i> , meaning "one who goes on an errand," is rendered thus ( Joshua 9:4 ;  Proverbs 13:17 ;  Isaiah 18:2 ;  Jeremiah 49:14 ;  Obadiah 1:1 ). This is also the rendering of <i> melits</i> , meaning "an interpreter," in  2 Chronicles 32:31 ; and of <i> malak</i> , a "messenger," in  2 Chronicles 35:21 ;  Isaiah 30:4 ;  33:7 ; Ezek.  <span class="badLink">17:15</span> . This is the name used by the apostle as designating those who are appointed by God to declare his will ( 2 Corinthians 5:20 ;  Ephesians 6:20 ).  </p><p> The Hebrews on various occasions and for various purposes had recourse to the services of ambassadors, e.g., to contract alliances ( Joshua 9:4 ), to solicit favours ( Numbers 20:14 ), to remonstrate when wrong was done ( Judges 11:12 ), to condole with a young king on the death of his father ( 2 Samuel 10:2 ), and to congratulate a king on his accession to the throne ( 1 Kings 5:1 ).  </p><p> To do injury to an ambassador was to insult the king who sent him ( 2 Samuel 10:5 ).  </p>
Amber	<p>( Ezekiel 1:4 Ezekiel 1:27 ;  8:2 . Heb., hashmal, rendered by the LXX. elektron, and by the Vulgate electrum), a metal compounded of silver and gold. Some translate the word by "polished brass," others "fine brass," as in  Revelation 1:15 ;  2:18 . It was probably the mixture now called electrum. The word has no connection, however, with what is now called amber, which is a gummy substance, reckoned as belonging to the mineral kingdom though of vegetable origin, a fossil resin.  </p>
Ambush	<p>Joshua at the capture of Ai lay in ambush, and so deceived the inhabitants that he gained an easy victory ( Joshua 8:4-26 ). Shechem was taken in this manner ( Judges 9:30-45 . Compare  Jeremiah 51:12 ).  </p>
Amen	<p>This Hebrew word means firm, and hence also faithful ( Revelation 3:14 ). In  Isaiah 65:16 , the Authorized Version has "the God of truth," which in Hebrew is "the God of Amen." It is frequently used by our Saviour to give emphasis to his words, where it is translated "verily." Sometimes, only, however, in John's Gospel, it is repeated, "Verily, verily." It is used as an epithet of the Lord Jesus Christ ( Revelation 3:14 ).  </p><p> It is found singly and sometimes doubly at the end of prayers ( Psalms 41:13 ;  72:19 ;  89:52 ), to confirm the words and invoke the fulfilment of them. It is used in token of being bound by an oath ( Numbers 5:22 ;  Deuteronomy 27:15-26 ;  Nehemiah 5:13 ;  8:6 ;  1 Chronicles 16:36 ). In the primitive churches it was common for the general audience to say "Amen" at the close of the prayer ( 1 Corinthians 14:16 ).  </p><p> The promises of God are Amen; i.e., they are all true and sure ( 2 Corinthians 1:20 ).  </p>
Amethyst	<p>one of the precious stones in the breastplate of the high priest ( Exodus 28:19 ;  39:12 ), and in the foundation of the New Jerusalem ( Revelation 21:20 ). The ancients thought that this stone had the power of dispelling drunkenness in all who wore or touched it, and hence its Greek name formed from <i> a_, "privative," and _methuo</i> , "to get drunk." Its Jewish name, <i> ahlamah'</i> , was derived by the rabbins from the Hebrew word <i> halam</i> , "to dream," from its supposed power of causing the wearer to dream. </p><p> It is a pale-blue crystallized quartz, varying to a dark purple blue. It is found in Persia and India, also in different parts of Europe. </p>
Amittai	<p>true, the father of Jonah the prophet, a native of Gath-hepher ( 2 Kings 14:25 ;  Jonah 1:1 ).  </p>
Ammah	<p>a cubit, the name of a hill which Joab and Abishai reached as the sun went down, when they were in pursuit of Abner ( 2 Samuel 2:24 ). It lay to the east of Gibeon.  </p>
Ammi	<p>my people, a name given by Jehovah to the people of Israel ( Hosea 2:1 Hosea 2:23 . Comp  1:9 ;  Ezekiel 16:8 ;  Romans 9:25 Romans 9:26 ;  1 Peter 2:10 ).  </p>
Ammiel	<p>people of God. </p><li> One of the twelve spies sent by Moses to search the land of Canaan ( Numbers 13:12 ). He was one of the ten who perished by the plague for their unfavourable report ( Numbers 14:37 ).  </li><li> The father of Machir of Lo-debar, in whose house Mephibosheth resided ( 2 Samuel 9:4 2 Samuel 9:5 ;  17:27 ).  </li><li> The father of Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah, and afterwards of David ( 1 Chronicles 3:5 ). He is called Eliam in  2 Samuel 11:3 .  </li><li> One of the sons of Obed-edom the Levite ( 1 Chronicles 26:5 ).   </li>
Ammihud	<p>people of glory; i.e., "renowned." </p><li> The father of the Ephraimite chief Elishama, at the time of the Exodus ( Numbers 1:10 ;  2:18 ;  Numbers 7:48 Numbers 7:53 ).  </li><li> Numbers 34:20 . </li><li> Numbers 34:28 .  </li><li> The father of Talmai, king of Geshur, to whom Absalom fled after the murder of Amnon ( 2 Samuel 13:37 ).  </li><li> The son of Omri, and the father of Uthai ( 1 Chronicles 9:4 ).   </li>
Amminadab	<p>kindred of the prince. </p><li> The father of Nahshon, who was chief of the tribe of Judah ( Numbers 1:7 ;  2:3 ;  Numbers 7:12 Numbers 7:17 ;  10:14 ). His daughter Elisheba was married to Aaron ( Exodus 6:23 ).  </li><li> A son of Kohath, the second son of Levi ( 1 Chronicles 6:22 ), called also Izhar (2,18).  </li><li> Chief of the 112 descendants of Uzziel the Levite ( 1 Chronicles 15:10 1 Chronicles 15:11 ).   </li>
Amminadib	<p>a person mentioned in Cant  6:12 , whose chariots were famed for their swiftness. It is rendered in the margin "my willing people," and in the Revised Version "my princely people."  </p>
Ammishaddai	<p>people of the Almighty, the father of Ahiezer, who was chief of the Danites at the time of the Exodus ( Numbers 1:12 ;  2:25 ). This is one of the few names compounded with the name of God, Shaddai, "Almighty."  </p>
Ammizabad	<p>people of the giver, the son of Benaiah, who was the third and chief captain of the host under David ( 1 Chronicles 27:6 ).  </p>
Ammon	<p>another form of the name Ben-ammi, the son of Lot ( Genesis 19:38 ). This name is also used for his posterity ( Psalms 83:7 ).  </p>
Ammonite	<p>the usual name of the descendants of Ammon, the son of Lot ( Genesis 19:38 ). From the very beginning ( Deuteronomy 2:16-20 ) of their history till they are lost sight of ( Judges 5:2 ), this tribe is closely associated with the Moabites ( Judges 10:11 ;  2 Chr  20:1 ;  Zephaniah 2:8 ). Both of these tribes hired Balaam to curse Israel ( Deuteronomy 23:4 ). The Ammonites were probably more of a predatory tribe, moving from place to place, while the Moabites were more settled. They inhabited the country east of the Jordan and north of Moab and the Dead Sea, from which they had expelled the Zamzummims or Zuzims ( Deuteronomy 2:20 ;  Genesis 14:5 ). They are known as the Beni-ammi ( Genesis 19:38 ), Ammi or Ammon being worshipped as their chief god. They were of Semitic origin, and closely related to the Hebrews in blood and language. They showed no kindness to the Israelites when passing through their territory, and therefore they were prohibited from "entering the congregation of the Lord to the tenth generation" ( Deuteronomy 23:3 ). They afterwards became hostile to Israel ( Judges 3:13 ). Jephthah waged war against them, and "took twenty cities with a very great slaughter" ( Judges 11:33 ). They were again signally defeated by Saul ( 1 Samuel 11:11 ). David also defeated them and their allies the Syrians ( 2 Samuel 10:6-14 ), and took their chief city, Rabbah, with much spoil ( 2 Samuel 10:14 ;  12:26-31 ). The subsequent events of their history are noted in  2 Chronicles 20:25 ;  26:8 ;  Jeremiah 49:1 ;  Ezekiel 25:3 Ezekiel 25:6 . One of Solomon's wives was Naamah, an Ammonite. She was the mother of Rehoboam ( 1 Kings 14:31 ;  2 Chr  12:13 ).  </p><p> The prophets predicted fearful judgments against the Ammonites because of their hostility to Israel ( Zephaniah 2:8 ;  Jeremiah 49:1-6 ;  Ezekiel 25:1-5 Ezekiel 25:10 ;  Amos 1:13-15 ).  </p><p> The national idol worshipped by this people was Molech or Milcom, at whose altar they offered human sacrifices ( 1 Kings 11:5 1 Kings 11:7 ). The high places built for this idol by Solomon, at the instigation of his Ammonitish wives, were not destroyed till the time of Josiah ( 2 Kings 23:13 ).  </p>
Amnon	<p>faithful. </p><li> One of the sons of Shammai, of the children of Ezra ( 1 Chronicles 4:20 ; Compare 17).  </li><li> The eldest son of David, by Ahinoam of Jezreel ( 1 Chronicles 3:1 ;  2 Sam  3:2 ). Absalom caused him to be put to death for his great crime in the matter of Tamar ( 2 Samuel 13:28 2 Samuel 13:29 ).   </li>
Amon	<p>builder. </p><li> The governor of Samaria in the time of Ahab. The prophet Micaiah was committed to his custody ( 1 Kings 22:26 ;  2 Chr  18:25 ).  </li><li> The son of Manasseh, and fourteenth king of Judah. He restored idolatry, and set up the images which his father had cast down. ( Zephaniah 1:4 ;  Zephaniah 3:4 Zephaniah 3:11 ) refers to the moral depravity prevailing in this king's reign.  <p> He was assassinated ( 2 Kings 21:18-26 :  2 Chr  33:20-25 ) by his own servants, who conspired against him.  </p></li><li> An Egyptian god, usually depicted with a human body and the head of a ram, referred to in  Jeremiah 46:25 , where the word "multitudes" in the Authorized Version is more appropriately rendered "Amon" in the Revised Version. In  Nahum 3:8  the expression "populous No" of the Authorized version is rendered in the Revised Version "No-amon." Amon is identified with Ra, the sun-god of Heliopolis.  </li><li> Nehemiah 7:59 .   </li>
Amorites	<p>highlanders, or hillmen, the name given to the descendants of one of the sons of Canaan ( Genesis 14:7 ), called Amurra or Amurri in the Assyrian and Egyptian inscriptions. On the early Babylonian monuments all Syria, including Palestine, is known as "the land of the Amorites." The southern slopes of the mountains of Judea are called the "mount of the Amorites" ( Deuteronomy 1:7 Deuteronomy 1:19 Deuteronomy 1:20 ). They seem to have originally occupied the land stretching from the heights west of the Dead Sea ( Genesis 14:7 ) to Hebron (13. Comp  13:8 ;  Deuteronomy 3:8 ;  4:46-48 ), embracing "all Gilead and all Bashan" ( Deuteronomy 3:10 ), with the Jordan valley on the east of the river ( 4:49 ), the land of the "two kings of the Amorites," Sihon and Og ( Deuteronomy 31:4 ;  Joshua 2:10 ;  9:10 ). The five kings of the Amorites were defeated with great slaughter by ( Joshua 10:10 ). They were again defeated at the waters of Merom by Joshua, who smote them till there were none remaining ( Joshua 11:8 ). It is mentioned as a surprising circumstance that in the days of Samuel there was peace between them and the Israelites ( 1 Samuel 7:14 ). The discrepancy supposed to exist between  Deuteronomy 1:44  and  Numbers 14:45  is explained by the circumstance that the terms "Amorites" and "Amalekites" are used synonymously for the "Canaanites." In the same way we explain the fact that the "Hivites" of  Genesis 34:2  are the "Amorites" of  48:22 . Compare  Joshua 10:6 ;  11:19  with  2 Samuel 21:2 ; also  Numbers 14:45  with  Deuteronomy 1:44 . The Amorites were warlike mountaineers. They are represented on the Egyptian monuments with fair skins, light hair, blue eyes, aquiline noses, and pointed beards. They are supposed to have been men of great stature; their king, Og, is described by Moses as the last "of the remnant of the giants" ( Deuteronomy 3:11 ). Both Sihon and Og were independent kings. Only one word of the Amorite language survives, "Shenir," the name they gave to Mount Hermon ( Deuteronomy 3:9 ).  </p>
Amos	<p>borne; a burden, one of the twelve minor prophets. He was a native of Tekota, the modern Tekua, a town about 12 miles south-east of Bethlehem. He was a man of humble birth, neither a "prophet nor a prophet's son," but "an herdman and a dresser of sycomore trees," RSV He prophesied in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah, and was contemporary with Isaiah and Hosea ( Amos 1:1 ;  Amos 7:14 Amos 7:15 ;  Zechariah 14:5 ), who survived him a few years. Under Jeroboam II. the kingdom of Israel rose to the zenith of its prosperity; but that was followed by the prevalence of luxury and vice and idolatry. At this period Amos was called from his obscurity to remind the people of the law of God's retributive justice, and to call them to repentance.  </p><p> The Book of Amos consists of three parts: </p><li> The nations around are summoned to judgment because of their sins ( (1:1-2:3). ). He quotes  Joel 3:16 .  </li><li> The spiritual condition of Judah, and especially of Israel, is described ( (2:4-6:14). ).  </li><li> In  7:1-9:10  are recorded five prophetic visions. (a) The first two ( 7:1-6 ) refer to judgments against the guilty people. (b) The next two ( 7:7-9 ;  8:1-3 ) point out the ripeness of the people for the threatened judgements  7:10-17  consists of a conversation between the prophet and the priest of Bethel. (c) The fifth describes the overthrow and ruin of Israel ( 9:1-10 ); to which is added the promise of the restoration of the kingdom and its final glory in the Messiah's kingdom.  <p> The style is peculiar in the number of the allusions made to natural objects and to agricultural occupations. Other allusions show also that Amos was a student of the law as well as a "child of nature." These phrases are peculiar to him: "Cleanness of teeth" [i.e., want of bread] ( 4:6 ); "The excellency of Jacob" ( 6:8 ;  8:7 ); "The high places of Isaac" ( 7:9 ); "The house of Isaac" ( 7:16 ); "He that createth the wind" ( 4:13 ). Quoted,  Acts 7:42 .  </p> </li>
Amoz	<p>strong, the father of the prophet Isaiah ( 2 Kings 19:2 2 Kings 19:20 ;  20:1 ;  Isaiah 1:1 ;  2:1 ). As to his personal history little is positively known. He is supposed by some to have been the "man of God" spoken of in  2 Chronicles 25:7 2 Chronicles 25:8 .  </p>
Amphipolis	<p>city on both sides, a Macedonian city, a great Roman military station, through which Paul and Silas passed on their way from Philippi to Thessalonica, a distance of 33Roman miles from Philippi ( Acts 17:1 ).  </p>
Amplias	<p>a Roman Christian saluted by Paul ( Romans 16:8 ).  </p>
Amram	<p>kindred of the High; i.e., "friend of Jehovah." </p><li> The son of Kohath, the son of Levi. He married Jochebed, "his father's sister," and was the father of Aaron, Miriam, and Moses ( Exodus 6:18 Exodus 6:20 ;  Numbers 3:19 ). He died in Egypt at the age of 137 years ( Exodus 6:20 ). His descendants were called Amramites ( Numbers 3:27 ;  1 Chronicles 26:23 ). </li><li> Ezra 10:34 .   </li>
Amraphel	<p>king of Shinar, southern Chaldea, one of the confederates of Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, in a war against Sodom and cities of the plain ( Genesis 14:1 Genesis 14:4 ). It is now found that Amraphel (or Ammirapaltu) is the Khammu-rabi whose name appears on recently-discovered monuments. (See CHEDORLAOMER). After defeating Arioch (q.v.) he united Babylonia under one rule, and made Babylon his capital.  </p>
Anab	<p>grape-town, one of the cities in the mountains of Judah, from which Joshua expelled the Anakim ( Joshua 11:21 ;  15:50 ). It still retains its ancient name. It lies among the hills, 10 miles south-south-west of Hebron.  </p>
Anah	<p>speech. </p><li> One of the sons of Seir, and head of an Idumean tribe, called a Horite, as in course of time all the branches of this tribe were called from their dwelling in caves in Mount Seir ( Genesis 36:20 Genesis 36:29 ;  1 Chronicles 1:38 ).  </li><li> One of the two sons of Zibeon the Horite, and father of Esau's wife Aholibamah ( Genesis 36:18 Genesis 36:24 ).   </li>
Anak	<p>long-necked, the son of Arba, father of the Anakim ( Joshua 15:13 ;  21:11 , Heb. <i> Anok</i> ). </p>
Anakim	<p>the descendants of Anak ( Joshua 11:21 ;  Numbers 13:33 ;  Deuteronomy 9:2 ). They dwelt in the south of Palestine, in the neighbourhood of Hebron ( Genesis 23:2 ;  Joshua 15:13 ). In the days of Abraham ( Genesis 14:5 Genesis 14:6 ) they inhabited the region afterwards known as Edom and Moab, east of the Jordan. They were probably a remnant of the original inhabitants of Palestine before the Canaanites, a Cushite tribe from Babel, and of the same race as the Phoenicians and the Egyptian shepherd kings. Their formidable warlike appearance, as described by the spies sent to search the land, filled the Israelites with terror. They seem to have identified them with the Nephilim, the "giants" ( Genesis 6:4 ;  Numbers 13:33 ) of the antediluvian age. There were various tribes of Anakim ( Joshua 15:14 ). Joshua finally expelled them from the land, except a remnant that found a refuge in the cities of Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod ( Joshua 11:22 ). The Philistine giants whom David encountered ( 2 Samuel 21:15-22 ) were descendants of the Anakim. (See GIANTS .) </p>
Anamim	<p>the name of an Egyptian tribe descended from Mizraim ( Genesis 10:13 ;  1 Chronicles 1:11 ).  </p>
Anammelech	<p>one of the gods worshipped by the people of Sepharvaim, who colonized Samaria ( 2 Kings 17:31 ). The name means "Anu is king." It was a female deity representing the moon, as Adrammelech (q.v.) was the male representing the sun.  </p>
Anan	<p>cloud, one of the Israelites who sealed the covenant after the return from Babylon ( Nehemiah 10:26 ).  </p>
Ananiah	<p>protected by Jehovah, the name of a town in the tribe of Benjamin between Nob and Hazor ( Nehemiah 11:32 ). It is probably the modern Beit Hanina, a small village 3 miles north of Jerusalem.  </p>
Ananias	<p>a common Jewish name, the same as Hananiah. </p><li> One of the members of the church at Jerusalem, who conspired with his wife Sapphira to deceive the brethren, and who fell down and immediately expired after he had uttered the falsehood ( Acts 5:5 ). By common agreement the members of the early Christian community devoted their property to the work of furthering the gospel and of assisting the poor and needy. The proceeds of the possessions they sold were placed at the disposal of the apostles ( Acts 4:36 Acts 4:37 ). Ananias might have kept his property had he so chosen; but he professed agreement with the brethren in the common purpose, and had of his own accord devoted it all, as he said, to these sacred ends. Yet he retained a part of it for his own ends, and thus lied in declaring that he had given it all. "The offence of Ananias and Sapphira showed contempt of God, vanity and ambition in the offenders, and utter disregard of the corruption which they were bringing into the society. Such sin, committed in despite of the light which they possessed, called for a special mark of divine indignation."  </li><li> A Christian at Damascus ( Acts 9:10 ). He became Paul's instructor; but when or by what means he himself became a Christian we have no information. He was "a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt" at Damascus ( 22:12 ).  </li><li> The high priest before whom Paul was brought in the procuratorship of Felix ( Acts 23:2 Acts 23:5 Acts 23:24 ). He was so enraged at Paul's noble declaration, "I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day," that he commanded one of his attendants to smite him on the mouth. Smarting under this unprovoked insult, Paul quickly replied, "God shall smite thee, thou whited wall." Being reminded that Ananias was the high priest, to whose office all respect was to be paid, he answered, "I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest" ( Acts 23:5 ). This expression has occasioned some difficulty, as it is scarcely probable that Paul should have been ignorant of so public a fact. The expression may mean (a) that Paul had at the moment overlooked the honour due to the high priest; or (b), as others think, that Paul spoke ironically, as if he had said, "The high priest breaking the law! God's high priest a tyrant and a lawbreaker! I see a man in white robes, and have heard his voice, but surely it cannot, it ought not to be, the voice of the high priest." (See Dr. Lindsay on Acts, <i> in loco</i> .) (c) Others think that from defect of sight Paul could not observe that the speaker was the high priest. In all this, however, it may be explained, Paul, with all his excellency, comes short of the example of his divine Master, who, when he was reviled, reviled not again.  </li>
Anath	<p>an answer; i.e., to "prayer", the father of Shamgar, who was one of the judges of Israel ( Judges 3:31 ).  </p>
Anathema	<p>anything laid up or suspended; hence anything laid up in a temple or set apart as sacred. In this sense the form of the word is <i> anath(ee)ma</i> , once in plural used in the Greek New Testament, in  Luke 21:5 , where it is rendered "gifts." In the LXX. the form <i> anathema</i> is generally used as the rendering of the Hebrew word <i> herem</i> , derived from a verb which means (1) to consecrate or devote; and (2) to exterminate. Any object so devoted to the Lord could not be redeemed ( Numbers 18:14 ;  Leviticus 27:28 Leviticus 27:29 ); and hence the idea of exterminating connected with the word. The Hebrew verb (haram) is frequently used of the extermination of idolatrous nations. It had a wide range of application. The <i> anathema_ or _herem</i> was a person or thing irrevocably devoted to God ( Leviticus 27:21 Leviticus 27:28 ); and "none devoted shall be ransomed. He shall surely be put to death" ( 27:29 ). The word therefore carried the idea of devoted to destruction ( Numbers 21:2 Numbers 21:3 ;  Joshua 6:17 ); and hence generally it meant a thing accursed. In  Deuteronomy 7:26  an idol is called a <i> herem</i> = <i> anathema</i> , a thing accursed. </p><p> In the New Testament this word always implies execration. In some cases an individual denounces an anathema on himself unless certain conditions are fulfilled ( Acts 23:12 Acts 23:14 Acts 23:21 ). "To call Jesus accursed" [anathema] ( 1 Corinthians 12:3 ) is to pronounce him execrated or accursed. If any one preached another gospel, the apostle says, "let him be accursed" ( Galatians 1:8 Galatians 1:9 ); i.e., let his conduct in so doing be accounted accursed.  </p><p> In  Romans 9:3 , the expression "accursed" (anathema) from Christ, i.e., excluded from fellowship or alliance with Christ, has occasioned much difficulty. The apostle here does not speak of his wish as a possible thing. It is simply a vehement expression of feeling, showing how strong was his desire for the salvation of his people.  </p><p> The anathema in  1 Corinthians 16:22  denotes simply that they who love not the Lord are rightly objects of loathing and execration to all holy beings; they are guilty of a crime that merits the severest condemnation; they are exposed to the just sentence of "everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord."  </p>
Anathoth	<p>the name of one of the cities of refuge, in the tribe of Benjamin ( Joshua 21:18 ). The Jews, as a rule, did not change the names of the towns they found in Palestine; hence this town may be regarded as deriving its name from the goddess Anat. It was the native place of Abiezer, one of David's "thirty" ( 2 Samuel 23:27 ), and of Jehu, another of his mighty men ( 1 Chronicles 12:3 ). It is chiefly notable, however, as the birth-place and usual residence of Jeremiah ( Jeremiah 1:1 ;  11:21-23 ;  29:27 ;  32:7-9 ). It suffered greatly from the army of Sennacherib, and only 128 men returned to it from the Exile ( Nehemiah 7:27 ;  Ezra 2:23 ). It lay about 3 miles north of Jerusalem. It has been identified with the small and poor village of 'Anata, containing about 100 inhabitants.  </p>
Anchor	<p>From  Acts 27:29 Acts 27:30 Acts 27:40 , it would appear that the Roman vessels carried several anchors, which were attached to the stern as well as to the prow. The Roman anchor, like the modern one, had two teeth or flukes. In  Hebrews 6:19  the word is used metaphorically for that which supports or keeps one steadfast in the time of trial or of doubt. It is an emblem of hope.  </p><p> "If you fear,  Put all your trust in God: that anchor holds." </p>
Ancient of Days	<p>an expression applied to Jehovah three times in the vision of ( Daniel 7:9 Daniel 7:13 Daniel 7:22 ) in the sense of eternal. In contrast with all earthly kings, his days are past reckoning.  </p>
Andrew	<p>manliness, a Greek name; one of the apostles of our Lord. He was of Bethsaida in Galilee ( John 1:44 ), and was the brother of Simon Peter ( Matthew 4:18 ;  10:2 ). On one occasion John the Baptist, whose disciple he then was, pointing to Jesus, said, "Behold the Lamb of God" ( John 1:40 ); and Andrew, hearing him, immediately became a follower of Jesus, the first of his disciples. After he had been led to recognize Jesus as the Messiah, his first care was to bring also his brother Simon to Jesus. The two brothers seem to have after this pursued for a while their usual calling as fishermen, and did not become the stated attendants of the Lord till after John's imprisonment ( Matthew 4:18 Matthew 4:19 ;  Mark 1:16 Mark 1:17 ). Very little is related of Andrew. He was one of the confidential disciples ( John 6:8 ;  12:22 ), and with Peter, James, and John inquired of our Lord privately regarding his future coming ( Mark 13:3 ). He was present at the feeding of the five thousand ( John 6:9 ), and he introduced the Greeks who desired to see Jesus ( John 12:22 ); but of his subsequent history little is known. It is noteworthy that Andrew thrice brings others to Christ, (1) Peter; (2) the lad with the loaves; and (3) certain Greeks. These incidents may be regarded as a key to his character.  </p>
Andronicus	<p>man-conquering, a Jewish Christian, the kinsman and fellowprisoner of Paul ( Romans 16:7 ); "of note among the apostles."  </p>
Anem	<p>two fountains, a Levitical city in the tribe of Issachar ( 1 Chronicles 6:73 ). It is also called En-gannim (q.v.) in  Joshua 19:21 ; the modern Jenin.  </p>
Aner	<p>a boy. </p><li> A Canaanitish chief who joined his forces with those of Abraham in pursuit of Chedorlaomer ( Genesis 14:13 Genesis 14:24 ).  </li><li> A city of Manasseh given to the Levites of Kohath's family ( 1 Chronicles 6:70 ).   </li>
Angel	<p>a word signifying, both in the Hebrew and Greek, a "messenger," and hence employed to denote any agent God sends forth to execute his purposes. It is used of an ordinary messenger ( Job 1:14 :  1 Samuel 11:3 ;  Luke 7:24 ;  9:52 ), of prophets ( Isaiah 42:19 ;  Haggai 1:13 ), of priests ( Malachi 2:7 ), and ministers of the New Testament ( Revelation 1:20 ).  </p><p> It is also applied to such impersonal agents as the pestilence ( 2 Samuel 24:16 2 Samuel 24:17 ;  2 Kings  19:35 ), the wind ( Psalms 104:4 ).  </p><p> But its distinctive application is to certain heavenly intelligences whom God employs in carrying on his government of the world. The name does not denote their nature but their office as messengers. The appearances to Abraham at Mamre ( Genesis 18:2 Genesis 18:22 . Comp  19:1 ), to Jacob at Peniel ( Genesis 32:24 Genesis 32:30 ), to Joshua at Gilgal ( Joshua 5:13 Joshua 5:15 ), of the Angel of the Lord, were doubtless manifestations of the Divine presence, "foreshadowings of the incarnation," revelations before the "fulness of the time" of the Son of God.  </p><li> The existence and orders of angelic beings can only be discovered from the Scriptures. Although the Bible does not treat of this subject specially, yet there are numerous incidental details that furnish us with ample information. Their personal existence is plainly implied in such passages as  Genesis 16:7 Genesis 16:10 Genesis 16:11 ;  Judges 13:1-21 ;  Matthew 28:2-5 ;  Hebrews 1:4 , etc.  <p> These superior beings are very numerous. "Thousand thousands," etc. ( Daniel 7:10 ;  Matthew 26:53 ;  Luke 2:13 ;  Hebrews 12:22 Hebrews 12:23 ). They are also spoken of as of different ranks in dignity and power ( Zechariah 1:9 Zechariah 1:11 ;  Daniel 10:13 ;  12:1 ;  1 Thessalonians 4:16 ;  Jude 1:9 ;  Ephesians 1:21 ;  Colossians 1:16 ).  </p></li><li> As to their nature, they are spirits ( Hebrews 1:14 ), like the soul of man, but not incorporeal. Such expressions as "like the angels" ( Luke 20:36 ), and the fact that whenever angels appeared to man it was always in a human form ( Genesis 18:2 ;  Genesis 19:1 Genesis 19:10 ;  Luke 24:4 ;  Acts 1:10 ), and the titles that are applied to them ("sons of God,"  Job 1:6 ;  38:7 ;  Daniel 3:25 ; Compare 28) and to men ( Luke 3:38 ), seem all to indicate some resemblance between them and the human race. Imperfection is ascribed to them as creatures ( Job 4:18 ;  Matthew 24:36 ;  1 Peter 1:12 ). As finite creatures they may fall under temptation; and accordingly we read of "fallen angels." Of the cause and manner of their "fall" we are wholly ignorant. We know only that "they left their first estate" ( Matthew 25:41 ;  Revelation 12:7 Revelation 12:9 ), and that they are "reserved unto judgement" ( 2 Peter 2:4 ). When the manna is called "angels' food," this is merely to denote its excellence ( Psalms 78:25 ). Angels never die ( Luke 20:36 ). They are possessed of superhuman intelligence and power ( Mark 13:32 ;  2 th  1:7 ;  Psalms 103:20 ). They are called "holy" ( Luke 9:26 ), "elect" ( 1 Timothy 5:21 ). The redeemed in glory are "like unto the angels" ( Luke 20:36 ). They are not to be worshipped ( Colossians 2:18 ;  Revelation 19:10 ).  </li><li> Their functions are manifold. (a) In the widest sense they are agents of God's providence ( Exodus 12:23 ;  Psalms 104:4 ;  Hebrews 11:28 ;  1 Corinthians 10:10 ;  2 Sam  24:16 ;  1 Chronicles 21:16 ;  2 Kings  19:35 ;  Acts 12:23 ). (b) They are specially God's agents in carrying on his great work of redemption. There is no notice of angelic appearances to man till after the call of Abraham. From that time onward there are frequent references to their ministry on earth ( Genesis 18 ;  19 ;  Genesis 24:7 Genesis 24:40 ;  28:12 ;  32:1 ). They appear to rebuke idolatry ( Judges 2:1-4 ), to call Gideon ( Judges 6:11 Judges 6:12 ), and to consecrate Samson ( 13:3 ). In the days of the prophets, from Samuel downward, the angels appear only in their behalf ( 1 Kings 19:5 ;  2 Kings  6:17 ; Zech. 1-6;  Daniel 4:13 Daniel 4:23 ;  Daniel 10:10 Daniel 10:13 Daniel 10:20 Daniel 10:21 ).  <p> The Incarnation introduces a new era in the ministrations of angels. They come with their Lord to earth to do him service while here. They predict his advent ( Matthew 1:20 ;  Luke 1:26-38 ), minister to him after his temptation and agony ( Matthew 4:11 ;  Luke 22:43 ), and declare his resurrection and ascension ( Matthew 28:2-8 ;  John 20:12 John 20:13 ;  Acts 1:10 Acts 1:11 ). They are now ministering spirits to the people of God ( Hebrews 1:14 ;  Psalms 34:7 ;  91:11 ;  Matthew 18:10 ;  Acts 5:19 ;  8:26 ;  10:3 ;  12:7 ;  27:23 ). They rejoice over a penitent sinner ( Luke 15:10 ). They bear the souls of the redeemed to paradise ( Luke 16:22 ); and they will be the ministers of judgement hereafter on the great day ( Matthew 13:39 Matthew 13:41 Matthew 13:49 ;  16:27 ;  24:31 ). The passages ( Psalms 34:7 ,  Matthew 18:10 ) usually referred to in support of the idea that every individual has a particular guardian angel have no such meaning. They merely indicate that God employs the ministry of angels to deliver his people from affliction and danger, and that the angels do not think it below their dignity to minister even to children and to the least among Christ's disciples.  </p><p> The "angel of his presence" ( Isaiah 63:9 . Compare  Exodus 23:20 Exodus 23:21 ;  32:34 ;  33:2 ;  Numbers 20:16 ) is probably rightly interpreted of the Messiah as the guide of his people. Others have supposed the expression to refer to Gabriel ( Luke 1:19 ).  </p> </li>
Anger	<p>the emotion of instant displeasure on account of something evil that presents itself to our view. In itself it is an original susceptibility of our nature, just as love is, and is not necessarily sinful. It may, however, become sinful when causeless, or excessive, or protracted ( Matthew 5:22 ;  Ephesians 4:26 ;  Colossians 3:8 ). As ascribed to God, it merely denotes his displeasure with sin and with sinners ( Psalms 7:11 ).  </p>
Anim	<p>fountains, a city in the mountains of Judah ( Joshua 15:50 ), now el-Ghuwein, near Eshtemoh, about 10 miles south-west of Hebron.  </p>
Animal	<p>an organized living creature endowed with sensation. The Levitical law divided animals into clean and unclean, although the distinction seems to have existed before the Flood ( Genesis 7:2 ). The clean could be offered in sacrifice and eaten. All animals that had not cloven hoofs and did not chew the cud were unclean. The list of clean and unclean quadrupeds is set forth in the Levitical law ( Deuteronomy 14:3-20 ;  Leviticus 11 ).  </p>
Anise	<p>This word is found only in  Matthew 23:23 . It is the plant commonly known by the name of dill, the Peucedanum graveolens of the botanist. This name dill is derived from a Norse word which means to soothe, the plant having the carminative property of allaying pain. The common dill, the Anethum graveolens, is an annual growing wild in the cornfields of Spain and Portugal and the south of Europe generally. There is also a species of dill cultivated in Eastern countries known by the name of shubit. It was this species of garden plant of which the Pharisees were in the habit of paying tithes. The Talmud requires that the seeds, leaves, and stem of dill shall pay tithes. It is an umbelliferous plant, very like the caraway, its leaves, which are aromatic, being used in soups and pickles. The proper anise is the Pimpinella anisum.  </p>
Anna	<p>grace, an aged widow, the daughter of Phanuel. She was a "prophetess," like Miriam, Deborah, and Huldah ( 2 Chronicles 34:22 ). After seven years of married life her husband died, and during her long widowhood she daily attended the temple services. When she was eighty-four years old, she entered the temple at the moment when the aged Simeon uttered his memorable words of praise and thanks to God that he had fulfilled his ancient promise in sending his Son into the world ( Luke 2:36 Luke 2:37 ).  </p>
Annas	<p>was high priest A.D. 7-14. In A.D. 25 Caiaphas, who had married the daughter of Annas ( John 18:13 ), was raised to that office, and probably Annas was now made president of the Sanhedrim, or deputy or coadjutor of the high priest, and thus was also called high priest along with Caiaphas ( Luke 3:2 ). By the Mosaic law the high-priesthood was held for life ( Numbers 3:10 ); and although Annas had been deposed by the Roman procurator, the Jews may still have regarded him as legally the high priest. Our Lord was first brought before Annas, and after a brief questioning of him ( John 18:19-23 ) was sent to Caiaphas, when some members of the Sanhedrim had met, and the first trial of Jesus took place ( Matthew 26:57-68 ). This examination of our Lord before Annas is recorded only by John. Annas was president of the Sanhedrim before which Peter and John were brought ( Acts 4:6 ).  </p>
Anoint	<p>The practice of anointing with perfumed oil was common among the Hebrews. </p><li> The act of anointing was significant of consecration to a holy or sacred use; hence the anointing of the high priest ( Exodus 29:29 ;  Leviticus 4:3 ) and of the sacred vessels ( Exodus 30:26 ). The high priest and the king are thus called "the anointed" ( Leviticus 4:3 Leviticus 4:5 Leviticus 4:16 ;  6:20 ;  Psalms 132:10 ). Anointing a king was equivalent to crowning him ( 1 Samuel 16:13 ;  2 Sam  2:4 , etc.). Prophets were also anointed ( 1 Kings 19:16 ;  1 Chronicles 16:22 ;  Psalms 105:15 ). The expression, "anoint the shield" ( Isaiah 21:5 ), refers to the custom of rubbing oil on the leather of the shield so as to make it supple and fit for use in war.  </li><li> Anointing was also an act of hospitality ( Luke 7:38 Luke 7:46 ). It was the custom of the Jews in like manner to anoint themselves with oil, as a means of refreshing or invigorating their bodies ( Deuteronomy 28:40 ;  Ruth 3:3 ;  2 Sam  14:2 ;  Psalms 104:15 , etc.). This custom is continued among the Arabians to the present day.  </li><li> Oil was used also for medicinal purposes. It was applied to the sick, and also to wounds ( Psalms 109:18 ;  Isaiah 1:6 ;  Mark 6:13 ;  James 5:14 ).  </li><li> The bodies of the dead were sometimes anointed ( Mark 14:8 ;  Luke 23:56 ).  </li><li> The promised Deliverer is twice called the "Anointed" or Messiah ( Psalms 2:2 ;  Daniel 9:25 Daniel 9:26 ), because he was anointed with the Holy Ghost ( Isaiah 61:1 ), figuratively styled the "oil of gladness" ( Psalms 45:7 ;  Hebrews 1:9 ). Jesus of Nazareth is this anointed One ( John 1:41 ;  Acts 9:22 ;  Acts 17:2 Acts 17:3 ;  Acts 18:5 Acts 18:28 ), the Messiah of the Old Testament.   </li>
Ant	<p>(Heb. nemalah, from a word meaning to creep, cut off, destroy), referred to in  Proverbs 6:6 ;  30:25 , as distinguished for its prudent habits. Many ants in Palestine feed on animal substances, but others draw their nourishment partly or exclusively from vegetables. To the latter class belongs the ant to which Solomon refers. This ant gathers the seeds in the season of ripening, and stores them for future use; a habit that has been observed in ants in Texas, India, and Italy.  </p>
Antichrist	<p>against Christ, or an opposition Christ, a rival Christ. The word is used only by the apostle John. Referring to false teachers, he says ( 1 John 2:18 1 John 2:22 ;  4:3 ;  2 John  1:7 ), "Even now are there many antichrists."  </p><li> This name has been applied to the "little horn" of the "king of fierce countenance" ( Daniel 7:24 Daniel 7:25 ;  8:23-25 ).  </li><li> It has been applied also to the "false Christs" spoken of by our Lord ( Matthew 24:5 Matthew 24:23 Matthew 24:24 ).  </li><li> To the "man of sin" described by Paul ( 2 Thessalonians 2:3 2 Thessalonians 2:4 2 Thessalonians 2:8-10 ).  </li><li> And to the "beast from the sea" ( Revelation 13:1 ;  17:1-18 ).   </li>
Antioch	<p></p><li> In Syria, on the river Orontes, about 16 miles from the Mediterranean, and some 300 miles north of Jerusalem. It was the metropolis of Syria, and afterwards became the capital of the Roman province in Asia. It ranked third, after Rome and Alexandria, in point of importance, of the cities of the Roman empire. It was called the "first city of the East." Christianity was early introduced into it ( Acts 11:19 Acts 11:21 Acts 11:24 ), and the name "Christian" was first applied here to its professors ( Acts 11:26 ). It is intimately connected with the early history of the gospel ( Acts 6:5 ;  Acts 11:19 Acts 11:27 Acts 11:28 Acts 11:30 ;  12:25 ;  15:22-35 ;  Galatians 2:11 Galatians 2:12 ). It was the great central point whence missionaries to the Gentiles were sent forth. It was the birth-place of the famous Christian father Chrysostom, who died A.D. 407. It bears the modern name of Antakia, and is now a miserable, decaying Turkish town. Like Philippi, it was raised to the rank of a Roman colony. Such colonies were ruled by "praetors" (RSV marg.,  Acts 16:20 Acts 16:21 ).  </li><li> In the extreme north of Pisidia; was visited by Paul and Barnabas on the first missionary journey ( Acts 13:14 ). Here they found a synagogue and many proselytes. They met with great success in preaching the gospel, but the Jews stirred up a violent opposition against them, and they were obliged to leave the place. On his return, Paul again visited Antioch for the purpose of confirming the disciples ( Acts 14:21 ). It has been identified with the modern Yalobatch, lying to the east of Ephesus.   </li>
Antiochus	<p>the name of several Syrian kings from B.C. 280 to B.C. 65. The most notable of these were, </p><li> Antiochus the Great, who ascended the throne B.C. 223. He is regarded as the "king of the north" referred to in  Daniel 11:13-19 . He was succeeded (B.C. 187) by his son, Seleucus Philopater, spoken of by ( Daniel 11:20 ) as "a raiser of taxes", in the Revised Version, "one that shall cause an exactor to pass through the glory of the kingdom."  </li><li> Antiochus IV., surnamed "Epiphanes" i.e., the Illustrious, succeeded his brother Seleucus (B.C. 175). His career and character are prophetically described by ( Daniel 11:21-32 ). He was a "vile person." In a spirit of revenge he organized an expedition against Jerusalem, which he destroyed, putting vast multitudes of its inhabitants to death in the most cruel manner. From this time the Jews began the great war of independence under their heroic Maccabean leaders with marked success, defeating the armies of Antiochus that were sent against them. Enraged at this, Antiochus marched against them in person, threatening utterly to exterminate the nation; but on the way he was suddenly arrested by the hand of death (B.C. 164).   </li>
Antipas	<p></p><li> Herod Antipas, a son of Herod the Great by his Samaritan wife Malthace. He was tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea during the whole period of our Lord's life on earth ( Luke 23:7 ). He was a frivolous and vain prince, and was chargeable with many infamous crimes ( Mark 8:15 ;  Luke 3:19 ;  Luke 13:31 Luke 13:32 ). He beheaded John the Baptist ( Matthew 14:1-12 ) at the instigation of Herodias, the wife of his half-brother Herod-Philip, whom he had married. Pilate sent Christ to him when he was at Jerusalem at the Passover ( Luke 23:7 ). He asked some idle questions of him, and after causing him to be mocked, sent him back again to Pilate. The wife of Chuza, his house-steward, was one of our Lord's disciples ( Luke 8:3 ).  </li><li> A "faithful martyr" ( Revelation 2:13 ), of whom nothing more is certainly known.   </li>
Antipatris	<p>a city built by Herod the Great, and called by this name in honour of his father, Antipater. It lay between Caesarea and Lydda, two miles inland, on the great Roman road from Caesarea to Jerusalem. To this place Paul was brought by night ( Acts 23:31 ) on his way to Caesarea, from which it was distant 28 miles. It is identified with the modern, Ras-el-Ain, where rise the springs of Aujeh, the largest springs in Palestine.  </p>
Antonia	<p>a fortress in Jerusalem, at the north-west corner of the temple area. It is called "the castle" ( Acts 21:34 Acts 21:37 ). From the stairs of this castle Paul delivered his famous speech to the multitude in the area below ( Acts 22:1-21 ). It was originally a place in which were kept the vestments of the high priest. Herod fortified it, and called it Antonia in honour of his friend Mark Antony. It was of great size, and commanded the temple. It was built on a plateau of rock, separated on the north from the hill Bezetha by a ditch about 30 feet deep and 165 feet wide.  </p>
Antothite	<p>an inhabitant of Anathoth, found only in  1 Chronicles 11:28 ;  12:3 . In  2 Samuel 23:27  it is Anethothite; in  1 Chronicles 27:12 , Anetothite. (RSV, "Anathothite.")  </p>
Anvil	<p>the rendering of the Hebrew word , "beaten," found only in  Isaiah 41:7 .  </p>
Ape	<p>an animal of the monkey tribe ( 1 Kings 10:22 ;  2 Chr  9:21 ). It was brought from India by the fleets of Solomon and Hiram, and was called by the Hebrews <i> koph_, and by the Greeks _kepos</i> , both words being just the Indian Tamil name of the monkey, kapi, i.e., swift, nimble, active. No species of ape has ever been found in Palestine or the adjacent regions. </p>
Apelles	<p>a Christian at Rome whom Paul salutes ( Romans 16:10 ), and styles "approved in Christ."  </p>
Apharsachites	<p>a company of the colonists whom the Assyrian king planted in Samaria ( Ezra 5:6 ;  6:6 ).  </p>
Apharsites	<p>another of the tribes removed to Samaria ( Ezra 4:9 ), or perhaps the same as the preceding.  </p>
Aphik	<p>( Judges 1:31 ); Aphek ( Joshua 13:4 ;  19:30 ), stronghold. </p><li> A city of the tribe of Asher. It was the scene of the licentious worship of the Syrian Aphrodite. The ruins of the temple, "magnificent ruins" in a "spot of strange wildness and beauty", are still seen at Afka, on the north-west slopes of Lebanon, near the source of the river Adonis (now Nahr Ibrahim), 12 miles east of Gebal.  </li><li> A city of the tribe of Issachar, near to Jezreel ( 1 Samuel 4:1 ;  29:1 ; comp  28:4 ).  </li><li> A town on the road from Damascus to Palestine, in the level plain east of Jordan, near which Benhadad was defeated by the Israelites ( 1 Kings 20:26 1 Kings 20:30 ;  2 Kings  13:17 ). It has been identified with the modern Fik, 6 miles east of the Sea of Galilee, opposite Tiberias.   </li>
Apocalypse	<p>the Greek name of the Book of Revelation (q.v.). </p>
Apocrypha	<p>hidden, spurious, the name given to certain ancient books which found a place in the LXX. and Latin Vulgate versions of the Old Testament, and were appended to all the great translations made from them in the sixteenth century, but which have no claim to be regarded as in any sense parts of the inspired Word. </p><li> They are not once quoted by the New Testament writers, who frequently quote from the LXX. Our Lord and his apostles confirmed by their authority the ordinary Jewish canon, which was the same in all respects as we now have it.  </li><li> These books were written not in Hebrew but in Greek, and during the "period of silence," from the time of Malachi, after which oracles and direct revelations from God ceased till the Christian era.  </li><li> The contents of the books themselves show that they were no part of Scripture. The Old Testament Apocrypha consists of fourteen books, the chief of which are the Books of the Maccabees (q.v.), the Books of Esdras, the Book of Wisdom, the Book of Baruch, the Book of Esther, Ecclesiasticus, Tobit, Judith, etc.  <p> The New Testament Apocrypha consists of a very extensive literature, which bears distinct evidences of its non-apostolic origin, and is utterly unworthy of regard. </p> </li>
Apollonia	<p>a city of Macedonia between Amphipolis and Thessalonica, from which it was distant about 36 miles. Paul and Silas passed through it on their way to Thessalonica ( Acts 17:1 ).  </p>
Apollos	<p>a Jew "born at Alexandria," a man well versed in the Scriptures and eloquent ( Acts 18:24 ; RSV, "learned"). He came to Ephesus (about A.D. 49), where he spake "boldly" in the synagogue ( 18:26 ), although he did not know as yet that Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah. Aquila and Priscilla instructed him more perfectly in "the way of God", i.e., in the knowledge of Christ. He then proceeded to Corinth, where he met Paul ( Acts 18:27 ;  19:1 ). He was there very useful in watering the good seed Paul had sown ( 1 Corinthians 1:12 ), and in gaining many to Christ. His disciples were much attached to him ( 1 Corinthians 3:4-7 1 Corinthians 3:22 ). He was with Paul at Ephesus when he wrote the First Epistle to the Corinthians; and Paul makes kindly reference to him in his letter to ( Titus 3:13 ). Some have supposed, although without sufficient ground, that he was the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews.  </p>
Apollyon	<p>destroyer, the name given to the king of the hosts represented by the locusts ( Revelation 9:11 ). It is the Greek translation of the Hebrew Abaddon (q.v.).  </p>
Apostle	<p>a person sent by another; a messenger; envoy. This word is once used as a descriptive designation of Jesus Christ, the Sent of the Father ( Hebrews 3:1 ;  John 20:21 ). It is, however, generally used as designating the body of disciples to whom he intrusted the organization of his church and the dissemination of his gospel, "the twelve," as they are called ( Matthew 10:1-5 ;  Mark 3:14 ;  6:7 ;  Luke 6:13 ;  9:1 ). We have four lists of the apostles, one by each of the synoptic evangelists ( Matthew 10:2-4 ;  Mark 3:16 ;  Luke 6:14 ), and one in the ( Acts 1:13 ). No two of these lists, however, perfectly coincide.  </p><p> Our Lord gave them the "keys of the kingdom," and by the gift of his Spirit fitted them to be the founders and governors of his church ( John 14:16 John 14:17 John 14:26 ;  John 15:26 John 15:27 ;  16:7-15 ). To them, as representing his church, he gave the commission to "preach the gospel to every creature" ( Matthew 28:18-20 ). After his ascension he communicated to them, according to his promise, supernatural gifts to qualify them for the discharge of their duties ( Acts 2:4 ;  1 Corinthians 2:16 ;  1 Corinthians 2:7 1 Corinthians 2:10 1 Corinthians 2:13 ;  2 co  5:20 ;  1 Corinthians 11:2 ). Judas Iscariot, one of "the twelve," fell by transgression, and Matthias was substituted in his place ( Acts 1:21 ). Saul of Tarsus was afterwards added to their number ( Acts 9:3-20 ;  20:4 ;  26:15-18 ;  1 Timothy 1:12 ;  2:7 ;  2 Tim  1:11 ).  </p><p> Luke has given some account of Peter, John, and the two Jameses ( Acts 12:2 Acts 12:17 ;  15:13 ;  21:18 ), but beyond this we know nothing from authentic history of the rest of the original twelve. After the martyrdom of James the Greater ( Acts 12:2 ), James the Less usually resided at Jerusalem, while Paul, "the apostle of the uncircumcision," usually travelled as a missionary among the Gentiles ( Galatians 2:8 ). It was characteristic of the apostles and necessary (1) that they should have seen the Lord, and been able to testify of him and of his resurrection from personal knowledge ( John 15:27 ;  Acts 1:21 Acts 1:22 ;  1 Corinthians 9:1 ;  Acts 22:14 Acts 22:15 ). </p><li> They must have been immediately called to that office by Christ ( Luke 6:13 ;  Galatians 1:1 ). </li><li> It was essential that they should be infallibly inspired, and thus secured against all error and mistake in their public teaching, whether by word or by writing ( John 14:26 ;  16:13 ;  1 Thessalonians 2:13 ).  </li><li> Another qualification was the power of working miracles ( Mark 16:20 ;  Acts 2:43 ;  1 Corinthians 12:8-11 ). The apostles therefore could have had no successors. They are the only authoritative teachers of the Christian doctrines. The office of an apostle ceased with its first holders.  <p> In  2 Corinthians 8:23  and Phil  2:25  the word "messenger" is the rendering of the same Greek word, elsewhere rendered "apostle."  </p> </li>
Apothecary	<p>rendered in the margin and the Revised Version "perfumer," in  Exodus 30:25 ;  37:29 ; Eccl  10:1 . The holy oils and ointments were prepared by priests properly qualified for this office. The feminine plural form of the Hebrew word is rendered "confectionaries" in  1 Samuel 8:13 .  </p>
Apparel	<p>In Old Testament times the distinction between male and female attire was not very marked. The statute forbidding men to wear female apparel ( Deuteronomy 22:5 ) referred especially to ornaments and head-dresses. Both men and women wore (1) an under garment or tunic, which was bound by a girdle. One who had only this tunic on was spoken of as "naked" ( 1 Samuel 19:24 ;  Job 24:10 ;  Isaiah 20:2 ). Those in high stations sometimes wore two tunics, the outer being called the "upper garment" ( 1 Samuel 15:27 ;  18:4 ;  24:5 ;  Job 1:20 ). </p><li> They wore in common an over-garment ("mantle,"  Isaiah 3:22 ;  1 Kings 19:13 ;  2 Kings  2:13 ), a loose and flowing robe. The folds of this upper garment could be formed into a lap ( Ruth 3:15 ;  Psalms 79:12 ;  Proverbs 17:23 ;  Luke 6:38 ). Generals of armies usually wore scarlet robes ( Judges 8:26 ;  Nahum 2:3 ). A form of conspicuous raiment is mentioned in  Luke 20:46 ; Compare  Matthew 23:5 .  <p> Priests alone wore trousers. Both men and women wore turbans. Kings and nobles usually had a store of costly garments for festive occasions ( Isaiah 3:22 ;  Zechariah 3:4 ) and for presents ( Genesis 45:22 ;  Esther 4:4 ;  Esther 6:8 Esther 6:11 ;  1 Samuel 18:4 ;  2 Kings  5:5 ;  10:22 ). Prophets and ascetics wore coarse garments ( Isaiah 20:2 ;  Zechariah 13:4 ;  Matthew 3:4 ).  </p> </li>
Appeal	<p>a reference of any case from an inferior to a superior court. Moses established in the wilderness a series of judicatories such that appeals could be made from a lower to a higher ( Exodus 18:13-26 .)  </p><p> Under the Roman law the most remarkable case of appeal is that of Paul from the tribunal of Festus at Caesarea to that of the emperor at Rome ( Acts 25:11 Acts 25:12 Acts 25:21 Acts 25:25 ). Paul availed himself of the privilege of a Roman citizen in this matter.  </p>
Apphia	<p>increasing, a female Christian at Colosse ( Philemon 1:2 ), supposed by some to have been the wife of Philemon.  </p>
Appii Forum	<p>i.e., "the market of Appius" ( Acts 28:15 , RSV), a town on the road, the "Appian Way," from Rome to Brundusium. It was 43 miles from Rome. Here Paul was met by some Roman Christians on his way to the capital. It was natural that they should halt here and wait for him, because from this place there were two ways by which travellers might journey to Rome.  </p>
Apple	<p>(Heb. tappuah, meaning "fragrance"). Probably the apricot or quince is intended by the word, as Palestine was too hot for the growth of apples proper. It is enumerated among the most valuable trees of Palestine ( Joel 1:12 ), and frequently referred to in Canticles, and noted for its beauty ( Joel 2:3 Joel 2:5 ;  <span class="badLink">8:5</span> ). There is nothing to show that it was the "tree of the knowledge of good and evil." Dr. Tristram has suggested that the apricot has better claims than any other fruit-tree to be the apple of Scripture. It grows to a height of 30 feet, has a roundish mass of glossy leaves, and bears an orange coloured fruit that gives out a delicious perfume. The "apple of the eye" is the Heb. <i> ishon</i> , meaning manikin, i.e., the pupil of the eye ( Proverbs 7:2 ). (Compare the promise,  Zechariah 2:8 ; the prayer,  Psalms 17:8 ; and its fulfilment,  Deuteronomy 32:10 .)  </p><p> The so-called "apple of Sodom" some have supposed to be the Solanum sanctum (Heb. hedek), rendered "brier" (q.v.) in  Micah 7:4 , a thorny plant bearing fruit like the potato-apple. This shrub abounds in the Jordan valley. (See ENGEDI .) </p>
Apron	<p>found in the Authorized Version in  Genesis 3:7 , of the bands of fig-leaves made by our first parents. In  Acts 19:12 , it denotes the belt or half-girdle worn by artisans and servants round the waist for the purpose of preserving the clothing from injury. In marg. of Authorized Version,  Ruth 3:15 , correctly rendered instead of "vail." (RSV, "mantle.")  </p>
Aquila	<p>eagle, a native of Pontus, by occupation a tent-maker, whom Paul met on his first visit to Corinth ( Acts 18:2 ). Along with his wife Priscilla he had fled from Rome in consequence of a decree (A.D. 50) by Claudius commanding all Jews to leave the city. Paul sojourned with him at Corinth, and they wrought together at their common trade, making Cilician hair-cloth for tents. On Paul's departure from Corinth after eighteen months, Aquila and his wife accompanied him to Ephesus, where they remained, while he proceeded to Syria ( Acts 18:18 Acts 18:26 ). When they became Christians we are not informed, but in Ephesus they were ( 1 Corinthians 16:19 ) Paul's "helpers in Christ Jesus." We find them afterwards at Rome ( Romans 16:3 ), interesting themselves still in the cause of Christ. They are referred to some years after this as being at Ephesus ( 2 Timothy 4:19 ). This is the last notice we have of them.  </p>
Arab	<p>ambush, a city in the mountains of Judah ( Joshua 15:52 ), now Er-Rabiyeh.  </p>
Arabah	<p>plain, in the Revised Version of  2 Kings 14:25 ;  Joshua 3:16 ;  8:14 ;  2 Sam  <span class="badLink">2:29</span> ;  4:7  (in all these passages the A.V. has "plain");  Amos 6:14  (A.V. "wilderness"). This word is found in the Authorized Version only in  Joshua 18:18 . It denotes the hollow depression through which the Jordan flows from the Lake of Galilee to the Dead Sea. It is now called by the Arabs el-Ghor. But the Ghor is sometimes spoken of as extending 10 miles south of the Dead Sea, and thence to the Gulf of Akabah on the Red Sea is called the Wady el-Arabah.  </p>
Arabia	<p>arid, an extensive region in the south-west of Asia. It is bounded on the west by the Isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea, on the south by the Indian Ocean, and on the east by the Persian Gulf and the Euphrates. It extends far into the north in barren deserts, meeting those of Syria and Mesopotamia. It is one of the few countries of the world from which the original inhabitants have never been expelled. </p><p> It was anciently divided into three parts:, </p><li> Arabia Felix (Happy Arabia), so called from its fertility. It embraced a large portion of the country now known by the name of Arabia. The Arabs call it Yemen. It lies between the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. </li><li> Arabia Deserta, the el-Badieh or "Great Wilderness" of the Arabs. From this name is derived that which is usually given to the nomadic tribes which wander over this region, the "Bedaween," or, more generally, "Bedouin," </li><li> Arabia Petraea, i.e., the Rocky Arabia, so called from its rocky mountains and stony plains. It comprehended all the north-west portion of the country, and is much better known to travellers than any other portion. This country is, however, divided by modern geographers into (1) Arabia Proper, or the Arabian Peninsula; (2) Northern Arabia, or the Arabian Desert; and (3) Western Arabia, which includes the peninsula of Sinai and the Desert of Petra, originally inhabited by the Horites ( Genesis 14:6 , etc.), but in later times by the descendants of Esau, and known as the Land of Edom or Idumea, also as the Desert of Seir or Mount Seir.  <p> The whole land appears ( Genesis 10 ) to have been inhabited by a variety of tribes of different lineage, Ishmaelites, Arabians, Idumeans, Horites, and Edomites; but at length becoming amalgamated, they came to be known by the general designation of Arabs. The modern nation of Arabs is predominantly Ishmaelite. Their language is the most developed and the richest of all the Semitic languages, and is of great value to the student of Hebrew.  </p><p> The Israelites wandered for forty years in Arabia. In the days of Solomon, and subsequently, commercial intercourse was to a considerable extent kept up with this country ( 1 Kings 10:15 ;  2 Chr  9:14 ;  17:11 ). Arabians were present in Jerusalem at Pentecost ( Acts 2:11 ). Paul retired for a season into Arabia after his conversion ( Galatians 1:17 ). This country is frequently referred to by the prophets ( Isaiah 21:11 ;  42:11 ;  Jeremiah 25:24 , etc.)  </p> </li>
Arad	<p></p><li> Now Tell Arad, a Canaanite city, about 20 miles south of Hebron. The king of Arad "fought against Israel and took of them prisoners" when they were retreating from the confines of Edom ( Numbers 21:1 ;  33:40 ;  Judges 1:16 ). It was finally subdued by ( Joshua 12:14 ).  </li><li> One of the sons of Beriah ( 1 Chronicles 8:15 ).   </li>
Aram	<p>the son of Shem ( Genesis 10:22 ); according to  Genesis 22:21 , a grandson of Nahor. In  Matthew 1:3 Matthew 1:4 , and  Luke 3:33 , this word is the Greek form of Ram, the father of Amminadab ( 1 Chronicles 2:10 ).  </p><p> The word means high, or highlands, and as the name of a country denotes that elevated region extending from the northeast of Palestine to the Euphrates. It corresponded generally with the Syria and Mesopotamia of the Greeks and Romans. In  Genesis 25:20 ;  Genesis 31:20 Genesis 31:24 ;  Deuteronomy 26:5 , the word "Syrian" is properly "Aramean" (RSV, marg.). Damascus became at length the capital of the several smaller kingdoms comprehended under the designation "Aram" or "Syria."  </p>
Aram-naharaim	<p>Aram of the two rivers, is Mesopotamia (as it is rendered in  Genesis 24:10 ), the country enclosed between the Tigris on the east and the Euphrates on the west ( Psalms 60 , title); called also the "field of Aram" ( Hosea 12:12 , RSV) i.e., the open country of Aram; in the Authorized Version, "country of Syria." Padan-aram (q.v.) was a portion of this country.  </p>
Aram-zobah	<p>( Psalms 60 , title), probably the region between the Euphrates and the Orontes.  </p>
Aran	<p>wild goat, a descendant of Seir the Horite ( Genesis 36:28 ).  </p>
Ararat	<p>sacred land or high land, the name of a country on one of the mountains of which the ark rested after the Flood subsided ( Genesis 8:4 ). The "mountains" mentioned were probably the Kurdish range of South Armenia. In  2 Kings 19:37 ,  Isaiah 37:38 , the word is rendered "Armenia" in the Authorized Version, but in the Revised Version, "Land of Ararat." In  Jeremiah 51:27 , the name denotes the central or southern portion of Armenia. It is, however, generally applied to a high and almost inaccessible mountain which rises majestically from the plain of the Araxes. It has two conical peaks, about 7 miles apart, the one 14,300 feet and the other 10,300 feet above the level of the plain. Three thousand feet of the summit of the higher of these peaks is covered with perpetual snow. It is called Kuh-i-nuh, i.e., "Noah's mountain", by the Persians. This part of Armenia was inhabited by a people who spoke a language unlike any other now known, though it may have been related to the modern Georgian. About B.C. 900 they borrowed the cuneiform characters of Nineveh, and from this time we have inscriptions of a line of kings who at times contended with Assyria. At the close of the seventh century B.C. the kingdom of Ararat came to an end, and the country was occupied by a people who are ancestors of the Armenians of the present day.  </p>
Araunah	<p>agile; also called Ornan  1 Chronicles 21:15 , a Jebusite who dwelt in Jerusalem before it was taken by the Israelites. The destroying angel, sent to punish David for his vanity in taking a census of the people, was stayed in his work of destruction near a threshing-floor belonging to Araunah which was situated on Mount Moriah. Araunah offered it to David as a free gift, together with the oxen and the threshing instruments; but the king insisted on purchasing it at its full price ( 2 Samuel 24:24 ;  1 Chronicles 21:24 1 Chronicles 21:25 ), for, according to the law of sacrifices, he could not offer to God what cost him nothing. On the same place Solomon afterwards erected the temple ( 2 Samuel 24:16 ;  2 Chr.  3:1 ). (See ALTAR .) </p>
Arba	<p>four, a giant, father of Anak. From him the city of Hebron derived its name of Kirjath-arba, i.e., the city of Araba ( Joshua 14:15 ;  15:13 ;  21:11 ;  Genesis 13:18 ;  23:2 ). (See HEBRON .) </p>
Arbathite	<p>a name given to Abi-albon, or, as elsewhere called, Abiel, one of David's warriors ( 2 Samuel 23:31 ;  1 Chronicles 11:32 ), probably as being an inhabitant of Arabah ( Joshua 15:61 ), a town in the wilderness of Judah.  </p>
Arch	<p>an architectural term found only in  Ezekiel 40:16 Ezekiel 40:21 Ezekiel 40:22 Ezekiel 40:26 Ezekiel 40:29 . There is no absolute proof that the Israelites employed arches in their buildings. The arch was employed in the building of the pyramids of Egypt. The oldest existing arch is at Thebes, and bears the date B.C. 1350. There are also still found the remains of an arch, known as Robinson's Arch, of the bridge connecting Zion and Moriah. (See TYROPOEON  VALLEY .) </p>
Archangel	<p>( 1 Thessalonians 4:16 ;  Jude 1:9 ), the prince of the angels.  </p>
Archelaus	<p>ruler of the people, son of Herod the Great, by Malthace, a Samaritan woman. He was educated along with his brother Antipas at Rome. He inherited from his father a third part of his kingdom viz., Idumea, Judea, and Samaria, and hence is called "king" ( Matthew 2:22 ). It was for fear of him that Joseph and Mary turned aside on their way back from Egypt. Till a few days before his death Herod had named Antipas as his successor, but in his last moments he named Archelaus.  </p>
Archer	<p>a shooter with the bow ( 1 Chronicles 10:3 ). This art was of high antiquity ( Genesis 21:20 ;  27:3 ). Saul was wounded by the Philistine archers ( 1 Samuel 31:3 ). The phrase "breaking the bow" ( Hosea 1:5 ;  Jeremiah 49:35 ) is equivalent to taking away one's power, while "strengthening the bow" is a symbol of its increase ( Genesis 49:24 ). The Persian archers were famous among the ancients ( Isaiah 13:18 ;  Jeremiah 49:35 ;  Jeremiah 50:9 Jeremiah 50:14 Jeremiah 50:29 Jeremiah 50:42 . (See BOW).  </p>
Archevite	<p>one of the nations planted by the Assyrians in Samaria ( Ezra 4:9 ); the men of Erech.  </p>
Archi	<p>a city on the boundary of Ephraim and Benjamin ( Joshua 16:2 ), between Bethel and Beth-horon the nether.  </p>
Archippus	<p>master of the horse, a "fellow-soldier" of Paul's ( Philemon 1:2 ), whom he exhorts to renewed activity ( Colossians 4:17 ). He was a member of Philemon's family, probably his son.  </p>
Archite	<p>the usual designation of Hushai ( 2 Samuel 15:32 ;  2 Samuel 17:5 2 Samuel 17:14 ;  1 Chronicles 27:33 ), who was a native of Archi. He was "the king's friend", i.e., he held office under David similar to that of our modern privy councillor.  </p>
Arcturus	<p>bear-keeper, the name given by the ancients to the brightest star in the constellation Bootes. In the Authorized Version ( Job 9:9 ;  38:32 ) it is the rendering of the Hebrew word <i> 'ash</i> , which probably designates the constellation the Great Bear. This word ('ash) is supposed to be derived from an Arabic word meaning night-watcher, because the Great Bear always revolves about the pole, and to our nothern hemisphere never sets. </p>
Ard	<p>descent, a grandson of Benjamin ( Numbers 26:38-40 ). In  1 Chronicles 8:3  he is called Addar. His descendants are mentioned in  Numbers 26:40 .  </p>
Ardon	<p>descendant, the last of the three sons of Caleb by his first wife Azubah ( 1 Chronicles 2:18 ).  </p>
Areopagite	<p>a member of the court of Areopagus ( Acts 17:34 ).  </p>
Areopagus	<p>the Latin form of the Greek word rendered "Mars' hill." But it denotes also the council or court of justice which met in the open air on the hill. It was a rocky height to the west of the Acropolis at Athens, on the south-east summit of which the council was held which was constituted by Solon, and consisted of nine archons or chief magistrates who were then in office, and the ex-archons of blameless life. </p><p> On this hill of Mars (Gr. Ares) Paul delivered his memorable address to the "men of Athens" ( Acts 17:22-31 ).  </p>
Aretas	<p>the father-in-law of Herod Antipas, and king of Arabia Petraea. His daughter returned to him on the occasion of her husband's entering into an adulterous alliance with Herodias, the wife of Herod-Philip, his half-brother ( Luke 3:19 Luke 3:20 ;  Mark 6:17 ;  Matthew 14:3 ). This led to a war between Aretas and Herod Antipas. Herod's army was wholly destroyed (A.D. 36). Aretas, taking advantage of the complications of the times on account of the death of the Emperor Tiberius (A.D. 37), took possession of Damascus ( 2 Corinthians 11:32 ; Compare  Acts 9:25 ). At this time Paul returned to Damascus from Arabia.  </p>
Argob	<p>stony heap, an "island," as it has been called, of rock about 30 miles by 20, rising 20 or 30 feet above the table-land of Bashan; a region of crags and chasms wild and rugged in the extreme. On this "island" stood sixty walled cities, ruled over by Og. It is called Trachonitis ("the rugged region") in the New Testament ( Luke 3:1 ). These cities were conquered by the Israelites ( Deuteronomy 3:4 ;  1 Kings 4:13 ). It is now called the Lejah. Here "sixty walled cities are still traceable in a space of 308 square miles. The architecture is ponderous and massive. Solid walls 4 feet thick, and stones on one another without cement; the roofs enormous slabs of basaltic rock, like iron; the doors and gates are of stone 18 inches thick, secured by ponderous bars. The land bears still the appearance of having been called the 'land of giants' under the giant Og." "I have more than once entered a deserted city in the evening, taken possession of a comfortable house, and spent the night in peace. Many of the houses in the ancient cities of Bashan are perfect, as if only finished yesterday. The walls are sound, the roofs unbroken, and even the window-shutters in their places. These ancient cities of Bashan probably contain the very oldest specimens of domestic architecture in the world" (Porter's Giant Cities). (See BASHAN .) </p>
Arieh	<p>the lion, the name of one of the body-guard slain with Pekahiah at Samaria ( 2 Kings 15:25 ) by the conspirator Pekah.  </p>
Ariel	<p>the lion of God. </p><li> One of the chief men sent by Ezra to procure Levites for the sanctuary ( Ezra 8:16 ).  </li><li> A symbolic name for Jerusalem ( Isaiah 29:1 Isaiah 29:2 Isaiah 29:7 ) as "victorious under God," and in  Ezekiel 43:15 Ezekiel 43:16 , for the altar (marg., Heb. 'ariel) of burnt offerings, the secret of Israel's lion-like strength.   </li>
Arimathea	<p>a "city of the Jews" ( Luke 23:51 ), the birth-place of Joseph in whose sepulchre our Lord was laid ( Matthew 27:57 Matthew 27:60 ;  John 19:38 ). It is probably the same place as Ramathaim in Ephraim, and the birth-place of Samuel ( 1 Samuel 1:1 1 Samuel 1:19 ). Others identify it with Ramleh in Dan, or Rama (q.v.) in Benjamin ( Matthew 2:18 ).  </p>
Arioch	<p>lion-like, venerable. </p><li> A king of Ellasar who was confederate with Chedorlamer ( Genesis 14:1 Genesis 14:9 ). The tablets recently discovered by Mr. Pinches (see CHALDEA) show the true reading is Eri-Aku of Larsa. This Elamite name meant "servant of the moon-god." It was afterwards changed into Rimsin, "Have mercy, O moon-god." </li><li> Daniel 2:14 .   </li>
Aristarchus	<p>best ruler, native of Thessalonica ( Acts 20:4 ), a companion of Paul ( Acts 19:29 ;  27:2 ). He was Paul's "fellow-prisoner" at Rome ( Colossians 4:10 ;  Philemon 1:24 ).  </p>
Aristobulus	<p>a Roman mentioned in Paul's Epistle to the ( Romans 16:10 ), whose "household" is saluated.  </p>
Ark	<p>Noah's ark, a building of gopher-wood, and covered with pitch, 300 cubits long, 50 cubits broad, and 30 cubits high ( Genesis 6:14-16 ); an oblong floating house of three stories, with a door in the side and a window in the roof. It was 100 years in building ( Genesis 5:32 ;  7:6 ). It was intended to preserve certain persons and animals from the deluge which God was about to bring over the earth. It contained eight persons ( Genesis 7:13 ;  2 Pet.  2:5 ), and of all "clean" animals seven pairs, and of "unclean" one pair, and of birds seven pairs of each sort ( Genesis 7:2 Genesis 7:3 ). It was in the form of an oblong square, with flat bottom and sloping roof. Traditions of the Deluge, by which the race of man was swept from the earth, and of the ark of Noah have been found existing among all nations.  </p><p> The ark of bulrushes in which the infant Moses was laid ( Exodus 2:3 ) is called in the Hebrew <i> teebah</i> , a word derived from the Egyptian <i> teb</i> , meaning "a chest." It was daubed with slime and with pitch. The bulrushes of which it was made were the papyrus reed. </p><p> The sacred ark is designated by a different Hebrew word, <i> 'aron'</i> , which is the common name for a chest or coffer used for any purpose ( Genesis 50:26 ;  2 Kings  Genesis 12:9 Genesis 12:10 ). It is distinguished from all others by such titles as the "ark of God" ( 1 Samuel 3:3 ), "ark of the covenant" ( Joshua 3:6 ;  Hebrews 9:4 ), "ark of the testimony" ( Exodus 25:22 ). It was made of acacia or shittim wood, a cubit and a half broad and high and two cubits long, and covered all over with the purest gold. Its upper surface or lid, the mercy-seat, was surrounded with a rim of gold; and on each of the two sides were two gold rings, in which were placed two gold-covered poles by which the ark could be carried ( Numbers 7:9 ;  10:21 ;  Numbers 4:5 Numbers 4:19 Numbers 4:20 ;  1 Kings 8:3 1 Kings 8:6 ). Over the ark, at the two extremities, were two cherubim, with their faces turned toward each other ( Leviticus 16:2 ;  Numbers 7:89 ). Their outspread wings over the top of the ark formed the throne of God, while the ark itself was his footstool ( Exodus 25:10-22 ;  37:1-9 ). The ark was deposited in the "holy of holies," and was so placed that one end of the poles by which it was carried touched the veil which separated the two apartments of the tabernacle ( 1 Kings 8:8 ). The two tables of stone which constituted the "testimony" or evidence of God's covenant with the people ( Deuteronomy 31:26 ), the "pot of manna" ( Exodus 16:33 ), and "Aaron's rod that budded" ( Numbers 17:10 ), were laid up in the ark ( Hebrews 9:4 ). (See TABERNACLE) The ark and the sanctuary were "the beauty of Israel" ( Lamentations 2:1 ). During the journeys of the Israelites the ark was carried by the priests in advance of the host ( Numbers 4:5 Numbers 4:6 ;  10:33-36 ;  Psalms 68:1 ;  132:8 ). It was borne by the priests into the bed of the Jordan, which separated, opening a pathway for the whole of the host to pass over ( Joshua 3:15 Joshua 3:16 ;  Joshua 4:7 Joshua 4:10 Joshua 4:11 Joshua 4:17 Joshua 4:18 ). It was borne in the procession round Jericho ( Joshua 6:4 Joshua 6:6 Joshua 6:8 Joshua 6:11 Joshua 6:12 ). When carried it was always wrapped in the veil, the badgers' skins, and blue cloth, and carefully concealed even from the eyes of the Levites who carried it. After the settlement of Israel in Palestine the ark remained in the tabernacle at Gilgal for a season, and was then removed to Shiloh till the time of Eli, between 300 and 400 years ( Jeremiah 7:12 ), when it was carried into the field of battle so as to secure, as they supposed, victory to the Hebrews, and was taken by the Philistines ( 1 Samuel 4:3-11 ), who sent it back after retaining it seven months ( 1 Samuel 5:7 1 Samuel 5:8 ). It remained then at Kirjath-jearim ( 1 Samuel 7:1 1 Samuel 7:2 ) till the time of David (twenty years), who wished to remove it to Jerusalem; but the proper mode of removing it having been neglected, Uzzah was smitten with death for putting "forth his hand to the ark of God," and in consequence of this it was left in the house of Obed-edom in Gath-rimmon for three months ( 2 Samuel 6:1-11 ), at the end of which time David removed it in a grand procession to Jerusalem, where it was kept till a place was prepared for it (12-19). It was afterwards deposited by Solomon in the temple ( 1 Kings 8:6-9 ). When the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem and plundered the temple, the ark was probably taken away by Nebuchadnezzar and destroyed, as no trace of it is afterwards to be found. The absence of the ark from the second temple was one of the points in which it was inferior to the first temple.  </p>
Arkite	<p>( Genesis 10:17 ;  1 Chronicles 1:15 ), a designation of certain descendants from the Phoenicians or Sidonians, the inhabitants of Arka, 12 miles north of Tripoli, opposite the northern extremity of Lebanon.  </p>
Arm	<p>used to denote power ( Psalms 10:15 ;  Ezekiel 30:21 ;  Jeremiah 48:25 ). It is also used of the omnipotence of God ( Exodus 15:16 ;  Psalms 89:13 ;  98:1 ;  77:15 ;  Isaiah 53:1 ;  John 12:38 ;  Acts 13:17 )  </p>
Armageddon	<p>occurs only in  Revelation 16:16  (RSV, "Har-Magedon"), as symbolically designating the place where the "battle of that great day of God Almighty" (ver. 14) shall be fought. The word properly means the "mount of Megiddo." It is the scene of the final conflict between Christ and Antichrist. The idea of such a scene was suggested by the Old Testament great battle-field, the plain of Esdraelon (q.v.).  </p>
Armenia	<p>high land, occurs only in Authorized Version,  2 Kings 19:37 ; in Revised Version, "Ararat," which is the Hebrew word. A country in western Asia lying between the Caspian and the Black Sea. Here the ark of Noah rested after the Deluge ( Genesis 8:4 ). It is for the most part high table-land, and is watered by the Aras, the Kur, the Euphrates, and the Tigris. Ararat was properly the name of a part of ancient Armenia. Three provinces of Armenia are mentioned in  Jeremiah 51:27 , Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz. Some, however, think Minni a contraction for Armenia. (See ARARAT .) </p>
Armoni	<p>inhabitant of a fortress, the first-named of the two sons of Saul and Rizpah. He was delivered up to the Gibeonites by David, and hanged by them ( 2 Samuel 21:8 2 Samuel 21:9 ).  </p>
Armour	<p>is employed in the English Bible to denote military equipment, both offensive and defensive. </p><li> The offensive weapons were different at different periods of history. The "rod of iron" ( Psalms 2:9 ) is supposed to mean a mace or crowbar, an instrument of great power when used by a strong arm. The "maul" ( Proverbs 25:18 ; cognate Hebrew word rendered "battle-axe" in  Jeremiah 51:20 , and "slaughter weapon" in  Ezekiel 9:2 ) was a war-hammer or martel. The "sword" is the usual translation of <i> hereb</i> , which properly means "poniard." The real sword, as well as the dirk-sword (which was always double-edged), was also used ( 1 Samuel 17:39 ;  2 Sam  20:8 ;  1 Kings 20:11 ). The spear was another offensive weapon ( Joshua 8:18 ;  1 Samuel 17:7 ). The javelin was used by light troops ( Numbers 25:7 Numbers 25:8 ;  1 Samuel 13:22 ). Saul threw a javelin at David ( 1 Samuel 19:9 1 Samuel 19:10 ), and so virtually absolved him from his allegiance. The bow was, however, the chief weapon of offence. The arrows were carried in a quiver, the bow being always unbent till the moment of action ( Genesis 27:3 ;  48:22 ;  Psalms 18:34 ). The sling was a favourite weapon of the Benjamites ( 1 Samuel 17:40 ;  1 Chronicles 12:2 . Compare  1 Samuel 25:29 ).  </li><li> Of the defensive armour a chief place is assigned to the shield or buckler. There were the great shield or target (the <i> tzinnah</i> ), for the protection of the whole person ( Genesis 15:1 ;  Psalms 47:9 ;  1 Samuel 17:7 ;  Proverbs 30:5 ), and the buckler (Heb. <i> mageen</i> ) or small shield ( 1 Kings 10:17 ;  Ezekiel 26:8 ). In  Psalms 91:4  "buckler" is properly a roundel appropriated to archers or slingers. The helmet ( Ezekiel 27:10 ;  1 Samuel 17:38 ), a covering for the head; the coat of mail or corselet ( 1 Samuel 17:5 ), or habergeon ( <span class="badLink">Nehemiah 416</span> ;16), harness or breat-plate ( Revelation 9:9 ), for the covering of the back and breast and both upper arms ( Isaiah 59:17 ;  Ephesians 6:14 ). The cuirass and corselet, composed of leather or quilted cloth, were also for the covering of the body. Greaves, for the covering of the legs, were worn in the time of David ( 1 Samuel 17:6 ). Reference is made by Paul ( Ephesians 6:14-17 ) to the panoply of a Roman soldier. The shield here is the thureon, a door-like oblong shield above all, i.e., covering the whole person, not the small round shield. There is no armour for the back, but only for the front.   </li>
Armour-bearer	<p>an officer selected by kings and generals because of his bravery, not only to bear their armour, but also to stand by them in the time of danger. They were the adjutants of our modern armies ( Judges 9:54 ;  1 Samuel 14:7 ;  16:21 ;  31:6 ).  </p>
Armoury	<p>the place in which armour was deposited when not used ( Nehemiah 3:19 ;  Jeremiah 50:25 ). At first each man of the Hebrews had his own arms, because all went to war. There were no arsenals or magazines for arms till the time of David, who had a large collection of arms, which he consecrated to the Lord in his tabernacle (1Sa,  21:9 ;  2 Sam  8:7-12 ;  1 Chronicles 26:26 1 Chronicles 26:27 ).  </p>
Army	<p>The Israelites marched out of Egypt in military order ( Exodus 13:18 , "harnessed;" marg., "five in a rank"). Each tribe formed a battalion, with its own banner and leader ( Numbers 2:2 ;  10:14 ). In war the army was divided into thousands and hundreds under their several captains ( Numbers 31:14 ), and also into families ( Numbers 2:34 ;  2 Chr  25:5 ;  26:12 ). From the time of their entering the land of Canaan to the time of the kings, the Israelites made little progress in military affairs, although often engaged in warfare. The kings introduced the custom of maintaining a bodyguard (the Gibborim; i.e., "heroes"), and thus the nucleus of a standing army was formed. Saul had an army of 3,000 select warriors ( 1 Samuel 13:2 ;  14:52 ;  24:2 ). David also had a band of soldiers around him ( 1 Samuel 23:13 ;  25:13 ). To this band he afterwards added the Cherethites and the Pelethites ( 2 Samuel 15:18 ;  20:7 ). At first the army consisted only of infantry ( 1 Samuel 4:10 ;  15:4 ), as the use of horses was prohibited ( Deuteronomy 17:16 ); but chariots and horses were afterwards added ( 2 Samuel 8:4 ;  1 Kings 10:26 1 Kings 10:28 1 Kings 10:29 ;  1 Kings 9:19 ). In  1 Kings 9:22  there is given a list of the various gradations of rank held by those who composed the army. The equipment and maintenance of the army were at the public expense ( 2 Samuel 17:28 2 Samuel 17:29 ;  1 Kings 4:27 ;  1 Kings 10:16 1 Kings 10:17 ;  Judges 20:10 ). At the Exodus the number of males above twenty years capable of bearing arms was 600,000 ( Exodus 12:37 ). In David's time it mounted to the number of 1,300,000 ( 2 Samuel 24:9 ).  </p>
Arnon	<p>swift, the southern boundary of the territory of Israel beyond Jordan, separating it from the land of Moab ( Deuteronomy 3:8 Deuteronomy 3:16 ). This river (referred to twenty-four times in the Bible) rises in the mountains of Gilead, and after a circuitous course of about 80 miles through a deep ravine it falls into the Dead Sea nearly opposite Engedi. The stream is almost dry in summer. It is now called el-Mujeb. The territory of the Amorites extended from the Arnon to the Jabbok.  </p>
Aroer	<p>ruins. </p><li> A town on the north bank of the Arnon ( Deuteronomy 4:48 ;  Judges 11:26 ;  2 Kings  10:33 ), the southern boundary of the kingdom of Sihon ( Joshua 12:2 ). It is now called Arair, 13 miles west of the Dead Sea.  </li><li> One of the towns built by the tribe of Gad ( Numbers 32:34 ) "before Rabbah" ( Joshua 13:25 ), the Ammonite capital. It was famous in the history of Jephthah ( Judges 11:33 ) and of David ( 2 Samuel 24:5 ). (Compare  Isaiah 17:2 ;  2 Kings  15:29 .)  </li><li> A city in the south of Judah, 12 miles south-east of Beersheba, to which David sent presents after recovering the spoil from the Amalekites at Ziklag ( 1 Samuel 30:26 1 Samuel 30:28 ). It was the native city of two of David's warriors ( 1 Chronicles 11:44 ). It is now called Ar'arah.   </li>
Arpad	<p>( Isaiah 10:9 ;  36:19 ;  37:13 ), also Arphad, support, a Syrian city near Hamath, along with which it is invariably mentioned ( 2 Kings 19:13 ;  18:34 ;  Isaiah 10:9 ), and Damascus ( Jeremiah 49:23 ). After a siege of three years it fell (B.C. 742) before the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser II. Now Tell Erfud.  </p>
Arphaxad	<p>son of Shem, born the year after the Deluge. He died at the age of 438 years ( Genesis 11:10-13 ;  1 Chronicles 1:17 1 Chronicles 1:18 ;  Luke 3:36 ). He dwelt in Mesopotamia, and became, according to the Jewish historian Josephus, the progenitor of the Chaldeans. The tendency is to recognize in the word the name of the country nearest the ancient domain of the Chaldeans. Some regard the word as an Egypticized form of the territorial name of Ur Kasdim, or Ur of the Chaldees.  </p>
Arrows	<p>At first made of reeds, and then of wood tipped with iron. Arrows are sometimes figuratively put for lightning ( Deuteronomy 32:23 Deuteronomy 32:42 ;  Psalms 7:13 ;  18:14 ;  144:6 ;  Zechariah 9:14 ). They were used in war as well as in the chase ( Genesis 27:3 ;  49:23 ). They were also used in divination ( Ezekiel 21:21 ).  </p><p> The word is frequently employed as a symbol of calamity or disease inflicted by God ( Job 6:4 ;  34:6 ;  Psalms 38:2 ;  Deuteronomy 32:23 . Compare  Ezekiel 5:16 ), or of some sudden danger ( Psalms 91:5 ), or bitter words ( Psalms 64:3 ), or false testimony ( Proverbs 25:18 ).  </p>
Artaxerxes	<p>the Greek form of the name of several Persian kings. </p><li> The king who obstructed the rebuilding of the temple ( Ezra 4:7 ). He was probably the Smerdis of profane history.  </li><li> The king mentioned in  Ezra 7:1 , in the seventh year (B.C. 458) of whose reign Ezra led a second colony of Jews back to Jerusalem, was probably Longimanus, who reigned for forty years (B.C. 464-425); the grandson of Darius, who, fourteen years later, permitted Nehemiah to return and rebuild Jerusalem.   </li>
Artificer	<p>a person engaged in any kind of manual occupation ( Genesis 4:22 ;  Isaiah 3:3 ).  </p>
Artillery	<p> 1 Samuel 20:40 , (Heb. keli, meaning "apparatus;" here meaning collectively any missile weapons, as arrows and lances. In Revised Version, "weapons"). This word is derived from the Latin artillaria = equipment of war.  </p>
Arvad	<p>wandering, ( Ezekiel 27:8 ), a small island and city on the coast of Syria, mentioned as furnishing mariners and soldiers for Tyre. The inhabitants were called Arvadites. The name is written Aruada or Arada in the Tell-el-Amarna tablets.  </p>
Asa	<p>physician, son of Abijah and grandson of Rehoboam, was the third king of Judah. He was zealous in maintaining the true worship of God, and in rooting all idolatry, with its accompanying immoralities, out of the land ( 1 Kings 15:8-14 ). The Lord gave him and his land rest and prosperity. It is recorded of him, however, that in his old age, when afflicted, he "sought not to the Lord, but to the physicians" (Compare  Jeremiah 17:5 ). He died in the forty-first year of his reign, greatly honoured by his people ( 2 Chronicles 16:1-13 ), and was succeeded by his son Jehoshaphat.  </p>
Asahel	<p>made by God, the youngest son of Zeruiah, David's sister. He was celebrated for his swiftness of foot. When fighting against Ish-bosheth at Gibeon, in the army of his brother Joab, he was put to death by Abner, whom he pursued from the field of battle ( 2 Samuel 2:18 2 Samuel 2:19 ). He is mentioned among David's thirty mighty men ( 2 Samuel 23:24 ;  1 Chronicles 11:26 ). Others of the same name are mentioned ( 2 Chronicles 17:8 ;  31:13 ;  Ezra 10:15 ).  </p>
Asaph	<p>convener, or collector. </p><li> A Levite; one of the leaders of David's choir ( 1 Chronicles 6:39 ).  Psalms 50  and 73-83 inclusive are attributed to him. He is mentioned along with David as skilled in music, and a "seer" ( 2 Chronicles 29:30 ). The "sons of Asaph," mentioned in 1Chr  <span class="badLink">1 Chronicles 20:14</span> , and  Ezra 2:41 , were his descendants, or more probably a class of poets or singers who recognized him as their master.  </li><li> The "recorder" in the time of Hezekiah ( 2 Kings 18:18 2 Kings 18:37 ).  </li><li> The "keeper of the king's forest," to whom Nehemiah requested from Artaxerxes a "letter" that he might give him timber for the temple at Jerusalem ( Nehemiah 2:8 ).   </li>
Ascension	<p>See CHRIST . </p>
Asenath	<p>an Egyptian name, meaning "gift of the sun-god", daughter of Potipherah, priest of On or Heliopolis, wife of Joseph ( Genesis 41:45 ). She was the mother of Manasseh and Ephraim (50-52;  46:20 ).  </p>
Ash	<p>(Heb. o'ren, "tremulous"), mentioned only  Isaiah 44:14  (RSV, "fir tree"). It is rendered "pine tree" both in the LXX. and Vulgate versions. There is a tree called by the Arabs <i> aran</i> , found still in the valleys of Arabia Petraea, whose leaf resembles that of the mountain ash. This may be the tree meant. Our ash tree is not known in Syria. </p>
Ashdod	<p>stronghold, a Philistine city ( Joshua 15:47 ), about midway between Gaza and Joppa, and 3 miles from the Mediterranean. It was one of the chief seats of the worship of Dagon ( 1 Samuel 5:5 ). It belonged to the tribe of Judah ( Joshua 15:47 ), but it never came into their actual possession. It was an important city, as it stood on the highroad from Egypt to Palestine, and hence was strongly fortified ( 2 Chronicles 26:6 ;  Isaiah 20:1 ). Uzziah took it, but fifty years after his death it was taken by the Assyrians (B.C. 758). According to Sargon's record, it was captured by him in B.C. 711. The only reference to it in the New Testament, where it is called Azotus, is in the account of Philip's return from Gaza ( Acts 8:40 ). It is now called Eshdud.  </p>
Ashdoth-pisgah	<p>( Deuteronomy 3:17 ;  Joshua 12:3 ;  13:20 ) in Authorized Version, but in Revised Version translated "slopes of Pisgah." In  Deuteronomy 4:49  it is translated in the Authorized Version "springs of Pisgah." The name Ashdoth is translated "springs" in the Authorized Version, but "slopes" in the Revised Version, of  Joshua 10:40  and  12:8 . It has been identified with the springs under Mount Nebo, now called 'Ayun Musa.  </p>
Asher	<p>happy, Jacob's eigth son; his mother was Zilpah, Leah's handmaid ( Genesis 30:13 ). Of the tribe founded by him nothing is recorded beyond its holding a place in the list of the tribes ( 35:26 ;  46:17 ;  Exodus 1:4 , etc.) It increased in numbers twenty-nine percent, during the thirty-eight years' wanderings. The place of this tribe during the march through the desert was between Dan and Naphtali ( Numbers 2:27 ). The boundaries of the inheritance given to it, which contained some of the richest soil in Palestine, and the names of its towns, are recorded in  Joshua 19:24-31 ;  Judges 1:31 Judges 1:32 . Asher and Simeon were the only tribes west of the Jordan which furnished no hero or judge for the nation. Anna the prophetess was of this tribe ( Luke 2:36 ).  </p>
Asherah	<p>and pl. Asherim in Revised Version, instead of "grove" and "groves" of the Authorized Version. This was the name of a sensual Canaanitish goddess Astarte, the feminine of the Assyrian Ishtar. Its symbol was the stem of a tree deprived of its boughs, and rudely shaped into an image, and planted in the ground. Such religious symbols ("groves") are frequently alluded to in Scripture ( Exodus 34:13 ;  Judges 6:25 ;  2 Kings  <span class="badLink">23:6</span> ;  1 Kings 16:33 , etc.). These images were also sometimes made of silver or of carved stone ( 2 Kings 21:7 ; "the graven image of Asherah," RSV). (See GROVE [1].).  </p>
Ashes	<p>The ashes of a red heifer burned entire ( Numbers 19:5 ) when sprinkled on the unclean made them ceremonially clean ( Hebrews 9:13 ).  </p><p> To cover the head with ashes was a token of self-abhorrence and humiliation ( 2 Samuel 13:19 ;  Esther 4:3 ;  Jeremiah 6:26 , etc.).  </p><p> To feed on ashes ( Isaiah 44:20 ), means to seek that which will prove to be vain and unsatisfactory, and hence it denotes the unsatisfactory nature of idol-worship. (Compare  Hosea 12:1 ).  </p>
Ashkelon	<p>=Askelon=Ascalon, was one of the five cities of the Philistines ( Joshua 13:3 ;  1 Samuel 6:17 ). It stood on the shore of the Mediterranean, 12 miles north of Gaza. It is mentioned on an inscription at Karnak in Egypt as having been taken by king Rameses II., the oppressor of the Hebrews. In the time of the judges ( Judges 1:18 ) it fell into the possession of the tribe of Judah; but it was soon after retaken by the Philistines ( 2 Samuel 1:20 ), who were not finally dispossessed till the time of Alexander the Great. Samson went down to this place from Timnath, and slew thirty men and took their spoil. The prophets foretold its destruction ( Jeremiah 25:20 ;  Jeremiah 47:5 Jeremiah 47:7 ). It became a noted place in the Middle Ages, having been the scene of many a bloody battle between the Saracens and the Crusaders. It was beseiged and taken by Richard the Lion-hearted, and "within its walls and towers now standing he held his court." Among the Tell Amarna tablets (see EGYPT) are found letters or official despatches from Yadaya, "captain of horse and dust of the king's feet," to the "great king" of Egypt, dated from Ascalon. It is now called 'Askalan.  </p>
Ashkenaz	<p>one of the three sons of Gomer ( Genesis 10:3 ), and founder of one of the tribes of the Japhetic race. They are mentioned in connection with Minni and Ararat, and hence their original seat must have been in Armenia ( Jeremiah 51:27 ), probably near the Black Sea, which, from their founder, was first called Axenus, and afterwards the Euxine.  </p>
Ashpenaz	<p>the master of the eunuchs of Nebuchadnezzar ( Daniel 1:3 ), the "Rabsaris" of the court. His position was similar to that of the Kislar-aga of the modern Turkish sultans.  </p>
Ashtaroth	<p>a city of Bashan, in the kingdom of Og ( Deuteronomy 1:4 ;  Joshua 12:4 ;  13:12 ;  9:10 ). It was in the half-tribe of Manasseh ( Joshua 13:12 ), and as a Levitical city was given to the Gershonites ( 1 Chronicles 6:71 ). Uzzia, one of David's valiant men ( 1 Chronicles 11:44 ), is named as of this city. It is identified with Tell Ashterah, in the Hauran, and is noticed on monuments B.C. 1700-1500. The name Beesh-terah ( Joshua 21:27 ) is a contraction for Beth-eshterah, i.e., "the house of Ashtaroth."  </p>
Ashteroth Karnaim	<p>Ashteroth of the two horns, the abode of the Rephaim ( Genesis 14:5 ). It may be identified with Ashtaroth preceding; called "Karnaim", i.e., the "two-horned" (the crescent moon). The Samaritan version renders the word by "Sunamein," the present es-Sunamein, 28 miles south of Damascus.  </p>
Ashtoreth	<p>the moon goddess of the Phoenicians, representing the passive principle in nature, their principal female deity; frequently associated with the name of Baal, the sun-god, their chief male deity ( Judges 10:6 ;  1 Samuel 7:4 ;  12:10 ). These names often occur in the plural (Ashtaroth, Baalim), probably as indicating either different statues or different modifications of the deities. This deity is spoken of as Ashtoreth of the Zidonians. She was the Ishtar of the Accadians and the Astarte of the Greeks ( Jeremiah 44:17 ;  1 Kings 11:5 1 Kings 11:33 ;  2 Kings  <span class="badLink">23:13</span> ). There was a temple of this goddess among the Philistines in the time of Saul ( 1 Samuel 31:10 ). Under the name of Ishtar, she was one of the great deities of the Assyrians. The Phoenicians called her Astarte. Solomon introduced the worship of this idol ( 1 Kings 11:33 ). Jezebel's 400 priests were probably employed in its service ( 1 Kings 18:19 ). It was called the "queen of heaven" ( Jeremiah 44:25 ).  </p>
Ashurites	<p>mentioned among those over whom Ish-bosheth was made king ( 2 Samuel 2:9 ).  </p>
Asia	<p>is used to denote Proconsular Asia, a Roman province which embraced the western parts of Asia Minor, and of which Ephesus was the capital, in  Acts 2:9 ;  6:9 ;  16:6 ;  Acts 19:10 Acts 19:22 ;  Acts 20:4 Acts 20:16 Acts 20:18 , etc., and probably Asia Minor in  Acts 19:26 Acts 19:27 ;  21:27 ;  24:18 ;  27:2 . Proconsular Asia contained the seven churches of the Apocalypse ( Revelation 1:11 ). The "chiefs of Asia" ( Acts 19:31 ) were certain wealthy citizens who were annually elected to preside over the games and religious festivals of the several cities to which they belonged. Some of these "Asiarchs" were Paul's friends.  </p>
Asnapper	<p>probably the same as Assur-bani-pal (Sardanapalos of the Greeks), styled the "great and noble" ( Ezra 4:10 ), was the son and successor (B.C. 668) of Esar-haddon (q.v.). He was "luxurious, ambitious, and cruel, but a magnificent patron of literature." He formed at Nineveh a library of clay tablets, numbering about 10,000. These are now mostly in the British Museum. They throw much light on the history and antiquities of Assyria.  </p><p> Assur-bani-pal was a munificent patron of literature, and the conqueror of Elam. Towards the middle of his reign his empire was shaken by a great rebellion headed by his brother in Babylon. The rebellion was finally put down, but Egypt was lost, and the military power of Assyria was so exhausted that it could with difficulty resist the hordes of Kimmerians who poured over Western Asia. (See NINEVEH .) </p>
Asp	<p>(Heb. pethen),  Deuteronomy 32:33 ;  Job 20:14 Job 20:16 ;  Isaiah 11:8 . It was probably the Egyptian cobra (Naja haje), which was very poisonous ( Romans 3:13 ; Gr. aspis). The Egyptians worshipped it as the <i> uraeus</i> , and it was found in the desert and in the fields. The peace and security of Messiah's reign is represented by the figure of a child playing on the hole of the asp. (See ADDER .) </p>
Ass	<p>frequently mentioned throughout Scripture. Of the domesticated species we read of, </p><li> The she ass (Heb. 'athon), so named from its slowness ( Genesis 12:16 ;  45:23 ;  Numbers 22:23 ;  1 Samuel 9:3 ). </li><li> The male ass (Heb. hamor), the common working ass of Western Asia, so called from its red colour. Issachar is compared to a strong ass ( Genesis 49:14 ). It was forbidden to yoke together an ass and an ox in the plough ( Deuteronomy 22:10 ). </li><li> The ass's colt (Heb. 'air), mentioned  Judges 10:4 ;  12:14 . It is rendered "foal" in  Genesis 32:15 ;  49:11 . (Compare  Job 11:12 ;  Isaiah 30:6 .) The ass is an unclean animal, because it does not chew the cud ( Leviticus 11:26 . Compare  2 Kings 6:25 ). Asses constituted a considerable portion of wealth in ancient times ( Genesis 12:16 ;  30:43 ;  1 Chronicles 27:30 ;  Job 1:3 ;  42:12 ). They were noted for their spirit and their attachment to their master ( Isaiah 1:3 ). They are frequently spoken of as having been ridden upon, as by Abraham ( Genesis 22:3 ), Balaam ( Numbers 22:21 ), the disobedient prophet ( 1 Kings 13:23 ), the family of Abdon the judge, seventy in number ( Judges 12:14 ), Zipporah ( Exodus 4:20 ), the Shunammite ( 1 Samuel 25:30 ), etc. ( Zechariah 9:9 ) predicted our Lord's triumphal entrance into Jerusalem, "riding upon an ass, and upon a colt," etc. ( Matthew 21:5 , RSV).  <p> Of wild asses two species are noticed, (1) that called in Hebrew <i> 'arod</i> , mentioned  Job 39:5  and  Daniel 5:21 , noted for its swiftness; and (2) that called <i> pe're</i> , the wild ass of Asia ( Job 39:6-8 ;  6:5 ;  11:12 ;  Isaiah 32:14 ;  Jeremiah 2:24 ;  14:6 , etc.). The wild ass was distinguished for its fleetness and its extreme shyness. In allusion to his mode of life, Ishmael is likened to a wild ass ( Genesis 16:12 . Here the word is simply rendered "wild" in the Authorized Version, but in the Revised Version, "wild-ass among men").  </p> </li>
Asshur	<p>second son of Shem ( Genesis 10:22 ;  1 Chronicles 1:17 ). He went from the land of Shinar and built Nineveh, etc. ( Genesis 10:11 Genesis 10:12 ). He probably gave his name to Assyria, which is the usual translation of the word, although the form Asshur is sometimes retained ( Numbers 24:22 Numbers 24:24 ;  Ezekiel 27:23 , etc.). In  Genesis 2:14  "Assyria" ought to be "Asshur," which was the original capital of Assyria, a city represented by the mounds of Kalah Sherghat, on the west bank of the Tigris. This city was founded by Bel-kap-kapu about B.C. 1700. At a later date the capital was shifted to Ninua, or Nineveh, now Koyunjik, on the eastern bank of the river. (See CALAH;  NINEVEH .) </p>
Assos	<p>a sea-port town of Proconsular Asia, in the district of Mysia, on the north shore of the Gulf of Adramyttium. Paul came hither on foot along the Roman road from Troas ( Acts 20:13 Acts 20:14 ), a distance of 20 miles. It was about 30 miles distant from Troas by sea. The island of Lesbos lay opposite it, about 7 miles distant.  </p>
Assurance	<p>The resurrection of Jesus ( Acts 17:31 ) is the "assurance" (Gr. pistis, generally rendered "faith") or pledge God has given that his revelation is true and worthy of acceptance. The "full assurance [Gr. plerophoria, 'full bearing'] of faith" ( Hebrews 10:22 ) is a fulness of faith in God which leaves no room for doubt. The "full assurance of understanding" ( Colossians 2:2 ) is an entire unwavering conviction of the truth of the declarations of Scripture, a joyful steadfastness on the part of any one of conviction that he has grasped the very truth. The "full assurance of hope" ( Hebrews 6:11 ) is a sure and well-grounded expectation of eternal glory ( 2 Timothy 4:7 2 Timothy 4:8 ). This assurance of hope is the assurance of a man's own particular salvation.  </p><p> This infallible assurance, which believers may attain unto as to their own personal salvation, is founded on the truth of the promises ( Hebrews 6:18 ), on the inward evidence of Christian graces, and on the testimony of the Spirit of adoption ( Romans 8:16 ). That such a certainty may be attained appears from the testimony of Scripture ( Romans 8:16 ;  1 John 2:3 ;  3:14 ), from the command to seek after it ( Hebrews 6:11 ;  2 Pet  1:10 ), and from the fact that it has been attained ( 2 Timothy 1:12 ;  2 Timothy 4:7 2 Timothy 4:8 ;  1 John 2:3 ;  4:16 ).  </p><p> This full assurance is not of the essence of saving faith. It is the result of faith, and posterior to it in the order of nature, and so frequently also in the order of time. True believers may be destitute of it. Trust itself is something different from the evidence that we do trust. Believers, moreover, are exhorted to go on to something beyond what they at present have when they are exhorted to seek the grace of full assurance ( Hebrews 10:22 ;  2 Pet  1:5-10 ). The attainment of this grace is a duty, and is to be diligently sought.  </p><p> "Genuine assurance naturally leads to a legitimate and abiding peace and joy, and to love and thankfulness to God; and these from the very laws of our being to greater buoyancy, strength, and cheerfulness in the practice of obedience in every department of duty." </p><p> This assurance may in various ways be shaken, diminished, and intermitted, but the principle out of which it springs can never be lost.

Assyria	<p>the name derived from the city Asshur on the Tigris, the original capital of the country, was originally a colony from Babylonia, and was ruled by viceroys from that kingdom. It was a mountainous region lying to the north of Babylonia, extending along the Tigris as far as to the high mountain range of Armenia, the Gordiaean or Carduchian mountains. It was founded in B.C. 1700 under Bel-kap-kapu, and became an independent and a conquering power, and shook off the yoke of its Babylonian masters. It subdued the whole of Northern Asia. The Assyrians were Semites ( Genesis 10:22 ), but in process of time non-Semite tribes mingled with the inhabitants. They were a military people, the "Romans of the East."  </p><p> Of the early history of the kingdom of Assyria little is positively known. In B.C. 1120 Tiglath-pileser I., the greatest of the Assyrian kings, "crossed the Euphrates, defeated the kings of the Hittites, captured the city of Carchemish, and advanced as far as the shores of the Mediterranean." He may be regarded as the founder of the first Assyrian empire. After this the Assyrians gradually extended their power, subjugating the states of Northern Syria. In the reign of Ahab, king of Israel, Shalmaneser II. marched an army against the Syrian states, whose allied army he encountered and vanquished at Karkar. This led to Ahab's casting off the yoke of Damascus and allying himself with Judah. Some years after this the Assyrian king marched an army against Hazael, king of Damascus. He besieged and took that city. He also brought under tribute Jehu, and the cities of Tyre and Sidon.  </p><p> About a hundred years after this (B.C. 745) the crown was seized by a military adventurer called Pul, who assumed the name of Tiglath-pileser III. He directed his armies into Syria, which had by this time regained its independence, and took (B.C. 740) Arpad, near Aleppo, after a siege of three years, and reduced Hamath. Azariah (Uzziah) was an ally of the king of Hamath, and thus was compelled by Tiglath-pileser to do him homage and pay a yearly tribute.  </p><p> In B.C. 738, in the reign of Menahem, king of Israel, Pul invaded Israel, and imposed on it a heavy tribute ( 2 Kings 15:19 ). Ahaz, the king of Judah, when engaged in a war against Israel and Syria, appealed for help to this Assyrian king by means of a present of gold and silver ( 2 Kings 16:8 ); who accordingly "marched against Damascus, defeated and put Rezin to death, and besieged the city itself." Leaving a portion of his army to continue the siege, "he advanced through the province east of Jordan, spreading fire and sword," and became master of Philistia, and took Samaria and Damascus. He died B.C. 727, and was succeeded by Shalmanezer IV., who ruled till B.C. 722. He also invaded Syria ( 2 Kings 17:5 ), but was deposed in favour of Sargon (q.v.) the Tartan, or commander-in-chief of the army, who took Samaria (q.v.) after a siege of three years, and so put an end to the kingdom of Israel, carrying the people away into captivity, B.C. 722 ( 2 Kings 17:1-6 2 Kings 17:24 ;  2 Kings 18:7 2 Kings 18:9 ). He also overran the land of Judah, and took the city of Jerusalem ( Isaiah 10:6 Isaiah 10:12 Isaiah 10:22 Isaiah 10:24 Isaiah 10:34 ). Mention is next made of Sennacherib (B.C. 705), the son and successor of Sargon ( 2 Kings 18:13 ;  19:37 ;  Isaiah 7:17 Isaiah 7:18 ); and then of Esar-haddon, his son and successor, who took Manasseh, king of Judah, captive, and kept him for some time a prisoner at Babylon, which he alone of all the Assyrian kings made the seat of his government ( 2 Kings 19:37 ;  Isaiah 37:38 ).  </p><p> Assur-bani-pal, the son of Esarhaddon, became king, and in  Ezra 4:10  is referred to as Asnapper. From an early period Assyria had entered on a conquering career, and having absorbed Babylon, the kingdoms of Hamath, Damascus, and Samaria, it conquered Phoenicia, and made Judea feudatory, and subjected Philistia and Idumea. At length, however, its power declined. In B.C. 727 the Babylonians threw off the rule of the Assyrians, under the leadership of the powerful Chaldean prince Merodach-baladan ( 2 Kings 20:12 ), who, after twelve years, was subdued by Sargon, who now reunited the kingdom, and ruled over a vast empire. But on his death the smouldering flames of rebellion again burst forth, and the Babylonians and Medes successfully asserted their independence (B.C. 625), and Assyria fell according to the prophecies of ( Isaiah 10:5-19 ), ( Nahum 3:19 ), and ( Zephaniah 3:13 ), and the many separate kingdoms of which it was composed ceased to recognize the "great king" ( 2 Kings 18:19 ;  Isaiah 36:4 ). Ezekiel (31) attests (about B.C. 586) how completely Assyria was overthrown. It ceases to be a nation. (See NINEVEH;  BABYLON .) </p>
Astrologer	<p>( Daniel 1:20 ;  Daniel 2:2 Daniel 2:10 Daniel 2:27 , etc.) Heb. 'ashshaph', an enchanter, one who professes to divine future events by the appearance of the stars. This science flourished among the Chaldeans. It was positively forbidden to the Jews ( Deuteronomy 4:19 ;  18:10 ;  Isaiah 47:13 ).  </p>
Astronomy	<p>The Hebrews were devout students of the wonders of the starry firmanent ( Amos 5:8 ;  Psalms 19 ). In the Book of Job, which is the oldest book of the Bible in all probability, the constellations are distinguished and named. Mention is made of the "morning star" ( Revelation 2:28 ; Compare  Isaiah 14:12 ), the "seven stars" and "Pleiades," "Orion," "Arcturus," the "Great Bear" ( Amos 5:8 ;  Job 9:9 ;  38:31 ), "the crooked serpent," Draco ( Job 26:13 ), the Dioscuri, or Gemini, "Castor and Pollux" ( Acts 28:11 ). The stars were called "the host of heaven" ( Isaiah 40:26 ;  Jeremiah 33:22 ).  </p><p> The oldest divisions of time were mainly based on the observation of the movements of the heavenly bodies, the "ordinances of heaven" ( Genesis 1:14-18 ;  Job 38:33 ;  Jeremiah 31:35 ;  33:25 ). Such observations led to the division of the year into months and the mapping out of the appearances of the stars into twelve portions, which received from the Greeks the name of the "zodiac." The word "Mazzaroth" ( Job 38:32 ) means, as the margin notes, "the twelve signs" of the zodiac. Astronomical observations were also necessary among the Jews in order to the fixing of the proper time for sacred ceremonies, the "new moons," the "passover," etc. Many allusions are found to the display of God's wisdom and power as seen in the starry heavens ( Psalms 8 ;  19:1-6 ;  Isaiah 51:6 , etc.)  </p>
Asuppim	<p>( 1 Chronicles 26:15 1 Chronicles 26:17 , Authorized Version; but in Revised Version, "storehouse"), properly the house of stores for the priests. In  Nehemiah 12:25  the Authorized Version has "thresholds," marg. "treasuries" or "assemblies;" Revised Version, "storehouses."  </p>
Atad	<p>buckthorn, a place where Joseph and his brethren, when on their way from Egypt to Hebron with the remains of their father Jacob, made for seven days a "great and very sore lamentation." On this account the Canaanites called it "Abel-mizraim" ( Genesis 50:10 Genesis 50:11 ). It was probably near Hebron. The word is rendered "bramble" in  Judges 9:14 Judges 9:15 , and "thorns" in  Psalms 58:9 .  </p>
Ataroth	<p>crowns. </p><li> A city east of Jordan, not far from Gilead ( Numbers 32:3 ).  </li><li> A town on the border of Ephraim and Benjamin ( Joshua 16:2 Joshua 16:7 ), called also Ataroth-adar ( 16:5 ). Now ed-Da'rieh.  </li><li> "Ataroth, the house of Joab" ( 1 Chronicles 2:54 ), a town of Judah inhabited by the descendants of Caleb.   </li>
Ater	<p>shut; lame. </p><li> Ezra 2:16 . </li><li> Nehemiah 10:17 . </li><li> Ezra 2:42 .   </li>
Athaliah	<p>whom God afflicts. </p><li> The daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, and the wife of Jehoram, king of Judah ( 2 Kings 8:18 ), who "walked in the ways of the house of Ahab" ( 2 Chronicles 21:6 ), called "daughter" of Omri ( 2 Kings 8:26 ). On the death of her husband and of her son Ahaziah, she resolved to seat herself on the vacant throne. She slew all Ahaziah's children except Joash, the youngest ( 2 Kings 11:1 2 Kings 11:2 ). After a reign of six years she was put to death in an insurrection ( 2 Kings 11:20 ;  2 Chr  21:6 ;  22:10-12 ;  23:15 ), stirred up among the people in connection with Josiah's being crowned as king.  </li><li> Ezra 8:7 . </li><li> 1 Chronicles 8:26 .   </li>
Athens	<p>the capital of Attica, the most celebrated city of the ancient world, the seat of Greek literature and art during the golden period of Grecian history. Its inhabitants were fond of novelty ( Acts 17:21 ), and were remarkable for their zeal in the worship of the gods. It was a sarcastic saying of the Roman satirist that it was "easier to find a god at Athens than a man."  </p><p> On his second missionary journey Paul visited this city ( Acts 17:15 ; Compare  1 Thessalonians 3:1 ), and delivered in the Areopagus his famous speech ( 17:22-31 ). The altar of which Paul there speaks as dedicated "to the [properly "an"] unknown God" (23) was probably one of several which bore the same inscription. It is supposed that they originated in the practice of letting loose a flock of sheep and goats in the streets of Athens on the occasion of a plague, and of offering them up in sacrifice, at the spot where they lay down, "to the god concerned."  </p>
Atonement	<p>This word does not occur in the Authorized Version of the New Testament except in  Romans 5:11 , where in the Revised Version the word "reconciliation" is used. In the Old Testament it is of frequent occurrence.  </p><p> The meaning of the word is simply at-one-ment, i.e., the state of being at one or being reconciled, so that atonement is reconciliation. Thus it is used to denote the effect which flows from the death of Christ. </p><p> But the word is also used to denote that by which this reconciliation is brought about, viz., the death of Christ itself; and when so used it means satisfaction, and in this sense to make an atonement for one is to make satisfaction for his offences ( Exodus 32:30 ;  Leviticus 4:26 ;  5:16 ;  Numbers 6:11 ), and, as regards the person, to reconcile, to propitiate God in his behalf.  </p><p> By the atonement of Christ we generally mean his work by which he expiated our sins. But in Scripture usage the word denotes the reconciliation itself, and not the means by which it is effected. When speaking of Christ's saving work, the word "satisfaction," the word used by the theologians of the Reformation, is to be preferred to the word "atonement." Christ's satisfaction is all he did in the room and in behalf of sinners to satisfy the demands of the law and justice of God. Christ's work consisted of suffering and obedience, and these were vicarious, i.e., were not merely for our benefit, but were in our stead, as the suffering and obedience of our vicar, or substitute. Our guilt is expiated by the punishment which our vicar bore, and thus God is rendered propitious, i.e., it is now consistent with his justice to manifest his love to transgressors. Expiation has been made for sin, i.e., it is covered. The means by which it is covered is vicarious satisfaction, and the result of its being covered is atonement or reconciliation. To make atonement is to do that by virtue of which alienation ceases and reconciliation is brought about. Christ's mediatorial work and sufferings are the ground or efficient cause of reconciliation with God. They rectify the disturbed relations between God and man, taking away the obstacles interposed by sin to their fellowship and concord. The reconciliation is mutual, i.e., it is not only that of sinners toward God, but also and pre-eminently that of God toward sinners, effected by the sin-offering he himself provided, so that consistently with the other attributes of his character his love might flow forth in all its fulness of blessing to men. The primary idea presented to us in different forms throughout the Scripture is that the death of Christ is a satisfaction of infinite worth rendered to the law and justice of God (q.v.), and accepted by him in room of the very penalty man had incurred. It must also be constantly kept in mind that the atonement is not the cause but the consequence of God's love to guilty men ( John 3:16 ;  Romans 3:24 Romans 3:25 ;  Ephesians 1:7 ;  1 John 1:9 ;  4:9 ). The atonement may also be regarded as necessary, not in an absolute but in a relative sense, i.e., if man is to be saved, there is no other way than this which God has devised and carried out ( Exodus 34:7 ;  Joshua 24:19 ;  Psalms 5:4 ;  7:11 ;  Nahum 1:2 Nahum 1:6 ;  Romans 3:5 ). This is God's plan, clearly revealed; and that is enough for us to know.  </p>
Atonement, Day of	<p>the great annual day of humiliation and expiation for the sins of the nation, "the fast" ( Acts 27:9 ), and the only one commanded in the law of Moses. The mode of its observance is described in  Leviticus 16:3-10 ;  23:26-32 ; and  Numbers 29:7-11 .  </p><p> It was kept on the tenth day of the month Tisri, i.e., five days before the feast of Tabernacles, and lasted from sunset to sunset. (See AZAZEL .) </p>
Augustus	<p>the cognomen of the first Roman emperor, C. Julius Caesar Octavianus, during whose reign Christ was born ( Luke 2:1 ). His decree that "all the world should be taxed" was the divinely ordered occasion of Jesus' being born, according to prophecy ( Micah 5:2 ), in Bethlehem. This name being simply a title meaning "majesty" or "venerable," first given to him by the senate (B.C. 27), was borne by succeeding emperors. Before his death (A.D. 14) he associated Tiberius with him in the empire ( Luke 3:1 ), by whom he was succeeded.  </p>
Augustus band	<p>( Acts 27:1 .: literally, of Sebaste, the Greek form of Augusta, the name given to Caesarea in honour of Augustus Caesar). Probably this "band" or cohort consisted of Samaritan soldiers belonging to Caesarea.  </p>
Ava	<p>a place in Assyria from which colonies were brought to Samaria ( 2 Kings 17:24 ). It is probably the same with Ivah ( 18:34 ;  19:13 ;  Isaiah 37:13 ). It has been identified with Hit on the Euphrates.  </p>
Aven	<p>nothingness; vanity. </p><li> Hosea speaks of the "high places of Aven" ( 10:8 ), by which he means Bethel. He also calls it Beth-aven, i.e., "the house of vanity" ( 4:15 ), on account of the golden calves Jeroboam had set up there ( 1 Kings 12:28 ).  </li><li> Translated by the LXX. "On" in  Ezekiel 30:17 . The Egyptian Heliopolis or city of On (q.v.).  </li><li> In  Amos 1:5  it denotes the Syrian Heliopolis, the modern Baalbec.   </li>
Avenger of blood	<p>(Heb. goel, from verb gaal, "to be near of kin," "to redeem"), the nearest relative of a murdered person. It was his right and duty to slay the murderer ( 2 Samuel 14:7 2 Samuel 14:11 ) if he found him outside of a city of refuge. In order that this law might be guarded against abuse, Moses appointed six cities of refuge ( Exodus 21:13 ;  Numbers 35:13 ;  Deuteronomy 19:1 Deuteronomy 19:9 ). These were in different parts of the country, and every facility was afforded the manslayer that he might flee to the city that lay nearest him for safety. Into the city of refuge the avenger durst not follow him. This arrangement applied only to cases where the death was not premeditated. The case had to be investigated by the authorities of the city, and the wilful murderer was on no account to be spared. He was regarded as an impure and polluted person, and was delivered up to the <i> goel</i> ( Deuteronomy 19:11-13 ). If the offence was merely manslaughter, then the fugitive must remain within the city till the death of the high priest ( Numbers 35:25 ).  </p>
Avim	<p>a people dwelling in Hazerim, or "the villages" or "encampments" on the south-west corner of the sea-coast ( Deuteronomy 2:23 ). They were subdued and driven northward by the Caphtorim. A trace of them is afterwards found in  Joshua 13:3 , where they are called Avites.  </p>
Awl	<p>an instrument only referred to in connection with the custom of boring the ear of a slave ( Exodus 21:6 ;  Deuteronomy 15:17 ), in token of his volunteering perpetual service when he might be free. (Compare  Psalms 40:6 ;  Isaiah 50:5 ).  </p>
Axe	<p>used in the Authorized Version of  Deuteronomy 19:5 ;  20:19 ;  1 Kings 6:7 , as the translation of a Hebrew word which means "chopping." It was used for felling trees ( Isaiah 10:34 ) and hewing timber for building. It is the rendering of a different word in Jud  Judges 13:20 Judges 13:21 ,  Psalms 74:5 , which refers to its sharpness. In  2 Kings 6:5  it is the translation of a word used with reference to its being made of iron. In  Isaiah 44:12  the Revised Version renders by "axe" the Hebrew <i> maatsad</i> , which means a "hewing" instrument. In the Authorized Version it is rendered "tongs." It is also used in  Jeremiah 10:3 , and rendered "axe." The "battle-axe" (army of Medes and Persians) mentioned in  Jeremiah 51:20  was probably, as noted in the margin of the Revised Version, a "maul" or heavy mace. In  Psalms 74:6  the word so rendered means "feller." (See the figurative expression in  Matthew 3:10 ;  Luke 3:9 .)  </p>
Azal	<p>( Zechariah 14:5 ) should perhaps be rendered "very near" = "the way of escape shall be made easy." If a proper name, it may denote some place near the western extremity of the valley here spoken of near Jerusalem.  </p>
Azariah	<p>whom Jehovah helps. </p><li> Son of Ethan, of the tribe of Judah ( 1 Chronicles 2:8 ).  </li><li> Son of Ahimaaz, who succeeded his grandfather Zadok as high priest ( 1 Chronicles 6:9 ;  1 Kings 4:2 ) in the days of Solomon. He officiated at the consecration of the temple ( 1 Chronicles 6:10 ).  </li><li> The son of Johanan, high priest in the reign of Abijah and Asa ( 2 Chronicles 6:10 2 Chronicles 6:11 ).  </li><li> High priest in the reign of Uzziah, king of Judah ( 2 Kings 14:21 ;  2 Chr  26:17-20 ). He was contemporary with the prophets Isaiah, Amos, and Joel.  </li><li> High priest in the days of Hezekiah ( 2 Chronicles 31:10-13 ). Of the house of Zadok.  </li><li> Several other priests and Levites of this name are mentioned ( 1 Chronicles 6:36 ;  Ezra 7:1 ;  1 Chronicles 9:11 ;  Nehemiah 3:23 , etc.).  </li><li> The original name of Abed-nego ( Daniel 1:6 Daniel 1:7 Daniel 1:11 Daniel 1:16 ). He was of the royal family of Judah, and with his other two companions remarkable for his personal beauty and his intelligence as well as piety.  </li><li> The son of Oded, a remarkable prophet in the days of Asa ( 2 Chronicles 15:1 ). He stirred up the king and the people to a great national reformation.   </li>
Azazel	<p>( Leviticus 16:8 Leviticus 16:10 Leviticus 16:26 , Revised Version only here; rendered "scape-goat" in the Authorized Version). This word has given rise to many different views. Some Jewish interpreters regard it as the name of a place some 12 miles east of Jerusalem, in the wilderness. Others take it to be the name of an evil spirit, or even of Satan. But when we remember that the two goats together form a type of Christ, on whom the Lord "laid the iniquity of us all," and examine into the root meaning of this word (viz., "separation"), the interpretation of those who regard the one goat as representing the atonement made, and the other, that "for Azazel," as representing the effect of the great work of atonement (viz., the complete removal of sin), is certainly to be preferred. The one goat which was "for Jehovah" was offered as a sin-offering, by which atonement was made. But the sins must also be visibly banished, and therefore they were symbolically laid by confession on the other goat, which was then "sent away for Azazel" into the wilderness. The form of this word indicates intensity, and therefore signifies the total separation of sin: it was wholly carried away. It was important that the result of the sacrifices offered by the high priest alone in the sanctuary should be embodied in a visible transaction, and hence the dismissal of the "scape-goat." It was of no consequence what became of it, as the whole import of the transaction lay in its being sent into the wilderness bearing away sin. As the goat "for Jehovah" was to witness to the demerit of sin and the need of the blood of atonement, so the goat "for Azazel" was to witness to the efficacy of the sacrifice and the result of the shedding of blood in the taking away of sin.  </p>
Azaziah	<p>whom Jehovah strengthened. </p><li> One of the Levitical harpers in the temple ( 1 Chronicles 15:21 ).  </li><li> The father of Hoshea, who was made ruler over the Ephraimites ( 1 Chronicles 27:20 ).  </li><li> One who had charge of the temple offerings ( 2 Chronicles 31:13 ).   </li>
Azekah	<p>dug over, a town in the Shephelah or low hills of Judah ( Joshua 15:35 ), where the five confederated Amoritish kings were defeated by Joshua and their army destroyed by a hailstrom ( Joshua 10:10 Joshua 10:11 ). It was one of the places re-occupied by the Jews on their return from the Captivity ( Nehemiah 11:30 ).  </p>
Azel	<p>noble, a descendant of king Saul ( 1 Chronicles 8:37 ;  1 Chronicles 9:43 1 Chronicles 9:44 ).  </p>
Azmaveth	<p>strong as death. </p><li> One of David's thirty warriors ( 2 Samuel 23:31 ).  </li><li> An overseer over the royal treasury in the time of David and Solomon ( 1 Chronicles 27:25 ).  </li><li> A town in the tribe of Judah, near Jerusalem ( Nehemiah 12:29 ;  Ezra 2:24 ).  </li><li> 1 Chronicles 8:36  </li>
Azotus	<p>the Grecized form ( Acts 8:40 , etc.) of Ashdod (q.v.).  </p>
Azubah	<p>deserted. </p><li> The wife of Caleb ( 1 Chronicles 2:18 1 Chronicles 2:19 ).  </li><li> The daughter of Shilhi, and mother of king Jehoshaphat ( 1 Kings 22:42 ).   </li>
Azur and Azzur	<p>helper. </p><li> The father of Hananiah, a false prophet ( Jeremiah 28:1 ).  </li><li> The father of Jaazaniah ( Ezekiel 11:1 ).  </li><li> One of those who sealed the covenant with Jehovah on the return from Babylon ( Nehemiah 10:17 ).   </li>
Berea	<p>a city of Macedonia to which Paul with Silas and Timotheus went when persecuted at Thessalonica ( Acts 17:10 Acts 17:13 ), and from which also he was compelled to withdraw, when he fled to the sea-coast and thence sailed to Athens (14,15). Sopater, one of Paul's companions belonged to this city, and his conversion probably took place at this time ( Acts 20:4 ). It is now called Verria.  </p>
Berechiah	<p>blessed by Jehovah. </p><li> Son of Shimea, and father of Asaph the musician ( 1 Chronicles 6:39 ;  15:17 ).  </li><li> One of the seven Ephraimite chieftains, son of Meshillemoth ( 2 Chronicles 28:12 ).  </li><li> The fourth of the five sons of Zerubbabel, of the royal family of Judah ( 1 Chronicles 3:20 ).  </li><li> The father of the prophet ( Zechariah 1:1 Zechariah 1:7 ).   </li>
Bered	<p>hail. </p><li> A town in the south of Palestine ( Genesis 16:14 ), in the desert of Shur, near Lahai-roi.  </li><li> A son of Shuthelah, and grandson of Ephraim ( 1 Chronicles 7:20 ).   </li>
Beriah	<p>a gift, or in evil. </p><li> One of Asher's four sons, and father of Heber ( Genesis 46:17 ).  </li><li> A son of Ephraim ( 1 Chronicles 7:20-23 ), born after the slaughter of his brothers, and so called by his father "because it went evil with his house" at that time.  </li><li> A Benjamite who with his brother Shema founded Ajalon and expelled the Gittites ( 1 Chronicles 8:13 ).   </li>
Bernice	<p>bearer of victory, the eldest daughter of Agrippa I., the Herod Agrippa of  Acts 12:20 . After the early death of her first husband she was married to her uncle Herod, king of Chalcis. After his death (A.D. 40) she lived in incestuous connection with her brother Agrippa II. ( Acts 25:13 Acts 25:23 ;  26:30 ). They joined the Romans at the outbreak of the final war between them and the Jews, and lived afterwards at Rome.  </p>
Berodach-baladan	<p>the king of Babylon who sent a friendly deputation to Hezekiah ( 2 Kings 20:12 ). In  Isaiah 39:1  he is called Merodach-baladan (q.v.).  </p>
Beryl	<p>the rendering in the Authorized Version of the Hebrew word <i> tarshish</i> , a precious stone; probably so called as being brought from Tarshish. It was one of the stones on the breastplate of the high priest ( Exodus 28:20 ; RSV marg., "chalcedony;"  39:13 ). The colour of the wheels in Ezekiel's vision was as the colour of a beryl stone ( 1:16 ;  10:9 ; RSV, "stone of Tarshish"). It is mentioned in Cant  5:14 ;  Daniel 10:6 ;  Revelation 21:20 . In  Ezekiel 28:13  the LXX. render the word by "chrysolite," which the Jewish historian Josephus regards as its proper translation. This also is the rendering given in the Authorized Version in the margin. That was a gold-coloured gem, the topaz of ancient authors.  </p>
Besom	<p>the rendering of a Hebrew word meaning sweeper, occurs only in  Isaiah 14:23 , of the sweeping away, the utter ruin, of Babylon.  </p>
Besor	<p>cold, a ravine or brook in the extreme south-west of Judah, where 200 of David's men stayed behind because they were faint, while the other 400 pursued the Amalekites ( 1 Samuel 30:9 1 Samuel 30:10 1 Samuel 30:21 ). Probably the Wadyes Sheriah, south of Gaza.  </p>
Bestead	<p>the rendering in  Isaiah 8:21 , where alone it occurs, of a Hebrew word meaning to oppress, or be in circumstances of hardship.  </p>
Betah	<p>confidence, a city belonging to Hadadezer, king of Zobah, which yielded much spoil of brass to David ( 2 Samuel 8:8 ). In  1 Chronicles 18:8  it is called Tibhath.  </p>
Beth	<p>occurs frequently as the appellation for a house, or dwelling-place, in such compounds as the words immediately following: </p>
Bethabara	<p>house of the ford, a place on the east bank of the Jordan, where John was baptizing ( John 1:28 ). It may be identical with Bethbarah, the ancient ford of Jordan of which the men of Ephraim took possession ( Judges 7:24 ). The Revised Version reads "Bethany beyond Jordan." It was the great ford, and still bears the name of "the ford," Makhadhet 'Abarah, "the ford of crossing over," about 25 miles from Nazareth. (See BETHBARAH .) </p>
Beth-anath	<p>house of response, one of the fenced cities of Naphtali ( Joshua 19:38 ). It is perhaps identical with the modern village 'Ainata, 6 miles west of Kedesh.  </p>
Beth-anoth	<p>house of answers, a city in the mountainous district of Judah ( Joshua 15:59 ). It has been identified with the modern Beit-'Anun, about 3 miles northeast of Hebron.  </p>
Bethany	<p>house of dates. </p><li> The Revised Version in  John 1:28  has this word instead of Bethabara, on the authority of the oldest manuscripts. It appears to have been the name of a place on the east of Jordan.  </li><li> A village on the south-eastern slope of the Mount of Olives ( Mark 11:1 ), about 2 miles east of Jerusalem, on the road to Jericho. It derived its name from the number of palm-trees which grew there. It was the residence of Lazarus and his sisters. It is frequently mentioned in connection with memorable incidents in the life of our Lord ( Matthew 21:17 ;  26:6 ;  Mark 11:11 Mark 11:12 ;  14:3 ;  Luke 24:50 ;  John 11:1 ;  12:1 ). It is now known by the name of el-Azariyeh, i.e., "place of Lazarus," or simply Lazariyeh. See n from a distance, the village has been described as "remarkably beautiful, the perfection of retirement and repose, of seclusion and lovely peace." Now a mean village, containing about twenty families.   </li>
Beth-arabah	<p>house of the desert, one of the six cities of Judah, situated in the sunk valley of the Jordan and Dead Sea ( Joshua 18:22 ). In  Joshua 15:61  it is said to have been "in the wilderness." It was afterwards included in the towns of Benjamin. It is called Arabah ( Joshua 18:18 ).  </p>
Beth-aram	<p>house of the height; i.e., "mountain-house", one of the towns of Gad, 3 miles east of Jordan, opposite Jericho ( Joshua 13:27 ). Probably the same as Beth-haran in  Numbers 32:36 . It was called by king Herod, Julias, or Livias, after Livia, the wife of Augustus. It is now called Beit-haran.  </p>
Beth-arbel	<p>house of God's court, a place alluded to by ( Hosea 10:14 ) as the scene of some great military exploit, but not otherwise mentioned in Scripture. The Shalman here named was probably Shalmaneser, the king of Assyria ( 2 Kings 17:3 ).  </p>
Beth-aven	<p>house of nothingness; i.e., "of idols", a place in the mountains of Benjamin, east of Bethel ( Joshua 7:2 ;  18:12 ;  1 Samuel 13:5 ). In  Hosea 4:15 ;  5:8 ;  10:5  it stands for "Bethel" (q.v.), and it is so called because it was no longer the "house of God," but "the house of idols," referring to the calves there worshipped.  </p>
Beth-barah	<p>house of crossing, a place south of the scene of Gideon's victory ( Judges 7:24 ). It was probably the chief ford of the Jordan in that district, and may have been that by which Jacob crossed when he returned from Mesopotamia, near the Jabbok ( Genesis 32:22 ), and at which Jephthah slew the Ephraimites ( Judges 12:4 ). Nothing, however, is certainly known of it. (See BETHABARA .) </p>
Beth-car	<p>sheep-house, a place to which the Israelites pursued the Philistines west from Mizpeh ( 1 Samuel 7:11 ).  </p>
Beth-dagon	<p>house of Dagon. </p><li> A city in the low country or plain of Judah, near Philistia ( Joshua 15:41 ); the modern Beit Degan, about 5 miles from Lydda.  </li><li> A city near the south-east border of Asher ( Joshua 19:27 ). It was a Philistine colony. It is identical with the modern ruined village of Tell D'auk.   </li>
Beth-diblathaim	<p>house of two cakes of figs, a city of Moab, upon which ( Jeremiah 48:22 ) denounced destruction. It is called also Almon-diblathaim ( Numbers 33:46 ) and Diblath ( Ezekiel 6:14 ). (RSV, "Diblah.")  </p>
Bethel	<p>house of God. </p><li> A place in Central Palestine, about 10 miles north of Jerusalem, at the head of the pass of Michmash and Ai. It was originally the royal Canaanite city of Luz ( Genesis 28:19 ). The name Bethel was at first apparently given to the sanctuary in the neighbourhood of Luz, and was not given to the city itself till after its conquest by the tribe of Ephraim. When Abram entered Canaan he formed his second encampment between Bethel and Hai ( Genesis 12:8 ); and on his return from Egypt he came back to it, and again "called upon the name of the Lord" ( 13:4 ). Here Jacob, on his way from Beersheba to Haran, had a vision of the angels of God ascending and descending on the ladder whose top reached unto heaven ( Genesis 28:10 Genesis 28:19 ); and on his return he again visited this place, "where God talked with him" ( 35:1-15 ), and there he "built an altar, and called the place El-beth-el" (q.v.). To this second occasion of God's speaking with Jacob at Bethel, ( Hosea 12:4 Hosea 12:5 ) makes reference.  <p> In troublous times the people went to Bethel to ask counsel of God ( Judges 20:18 Judges 20:31 ;  21:2 ). Here the ark of the covenant was kept for a long time under the care of Phinehas, the grandson of Aaron ( 20:26-28 ). Here also Samuel held in rotation his court of justice ( 1 Samuel 7:16 ). It was included in Israel after the kingdom was divided, and it became one of the seats of the worship of the golden calf ( 1 Kings 12:28-33 ;  13:1 ). Hence the prophet Hosea ( Hosea 4:15 ;  5:8 ;  Hosea 10:5 Hosea 10:8 ) calls it in contempt Beth-aven, i.e., "house of idols." Bethel remained an abode of priests even after the kingdom of Israel was desolated by the king of Assyria ( 2 Kings 17:28 2 Kings 17:29 ). At length all traces of the idolatries were extirpated by Josiah, king of Judah ( 2 Kings 23:15-18 ); and the place was still in existence after the Captivity ( Ezra 2:28 ;  Nehemiah 7:32 ). It has been identified with the ruins of Beitin, a small village amid extensive ruins some 9 miles south of Shiloh.  </p></li><li> Mount Bethel was a hilly district near Bethel ( Joshua 16:1 ;  1 Samuel 13:2 ).  </li><li> A town in the south of Judah ( Joshua 8:17 ;  12:16 ).   </li>
Bethelite	<p>a designation of Hiel (q.v.), who rebuilt Jericho and experienced the curse pronounced long before ( 1 Kings 16:34 ).  </p>
Bether	<p>dissection or separation, certain mountains mentioned in Cant.  2:17 ; probably near Lebanon.  </p>
Bethesda	<p>house of mercy, a reservoir (Gr. kolumbethra, "a swimming bath") with five porches, close to the sheep-gate or market ( Nehemiah 3:1 ;  John 5:2 ). Eusebius the historian (A.D. 330) calls it "the sheep-pool." It is also called "Bethsaida" and "Beth-zatha" ( John 5:2 , RSV marg.). Under these "porches" or colonnades were usually a large number of infirm people waiting for the "troubling of the water." It is usually identified with the modern so-called Fountain of the Virgin, in the valley of the Kidron, and not far from the Pool of Siloam (q.v.); and also with the Birket Israel, a pool near the mouth of the valley which runs into the Kidron south of "St. Stephen's Gate." Others again identify it with the twin pools called the "Souterrains," under the convent of the Sisters of Zion, situated in what must have been the rock-hewn ditch between Bezetha and the fortress of Antonia. But quite recently Schick has discovered a large tank, as sketched here, situated about 100 feet north-west of St. Anne's Church, which is, as he contends, very probably the Pool of Bethesda. No certainty as to its identification, however, has as yet been arrived at. (See FOUNTAIN;  GIHON .) </p>
Beth-gamul	<p>camel-house, a city in the "plain country" of Moab denounced by the prophet ( Jeremiah 48:23 ); probably the modern Um-el-Jemal, near Bozrah, one of the deserted cities of the Hauran.  </p>
Beth-gilgal	<p>house of Gilgal, a place from which the inhabitants gathered for the purpose of celebrating the rebuilding of the walls on the return exile ( Nehemiah 12:29 ). (See GILGAL .) </p>
Beth-haccerem	<p>house of a vineyard, a place in the tribe of Judah ( Nehemiah 3:14 ) where the Benjamites were to set up a beacon when they heard the trumpet against the invading army of the Babylonians ( Jeremiah 6:1 ). It is probable that this place is the modern 'Ain Karim, or "well of the vineyards," near which there is a ridge on which are cairns which may have served as beacons of old, one of which is 40 feet high and 130 in diameter.  </p>
Beth-horon	<p>house of the hollow, or of the cavern, the name of two towns or villages ( 2 Chronicles 8:5 ;  1 Chronicles 7:24 ) in the territory of Ephraim, on the way from Jerusalem to Joppa. They are distinguished as Beth-horon "the upper" and Beth-horon "the nether." They are about 2 miles apart, the former being about 10 miles north-west of Jerusalem. Between the two places was the ascent and descent of Beth-horon, leading from Gibeon down to the western plain ( Joshua 10:10 Joshua 10:11 ;  Joshua 18:13 Joshua 18:14 ), down which the five kings of the Amorites were driven by Joshua in that great battle, the most important in which the Hebrews had been as yet engaged, being their first conflict with their enemies in the open field. Jehovah interposed in behalf of Israel by a terrific hailstorm, which caused more deaths among the Canaanites than did the swords of the Israelites. Beth-horon is mentioned as having been taken by Shishak, B.C. 945, in the list of his conquests, and the pass was the scene of a victory of Judas Maccabeus. (Compare  Exodus 9:19 Exodus 9:25 ;  Job 38:22 Job 38:23 ;  Psalms 18:12-14 ;  Isaiah 30:30 .) The modern name of these places is Beit-ur, distinguished by el-Foka, "the upper," and el-Tahta, "the nether." The lower was at the foot of the pass, and the upper, 500 feet higher, at the top, west of Gibeon. (See GIBEON .) </p>
Beth-jeshimoth	<p>house of wastes, or deserts, a town near Abel-shittim, east of Jordan, in the desert of Moab, where the Israelites encamped not long before crossing the Jordan ( Numbers 33:49 ; A.V., "Bethjesimoth"). It was within the territory of Sihon, king of the Amorites ( Joshua 12:3 ).  </p>
Beth-le-Aphrah	<p>(RSV  Micah 1:10 ), house of dust. The Authorized Version reads "in the house of Aphrah." This is probably the name of a town in the Shephelah, or "low country," between Joppa and Gaza.  </p>
Bethlehem	<p>house of bread. </p><li> A city in the "hill country" of Judah. It was originally called Ephrath ( Genesis 35:16 Genesis 35:19 ;  48:7 ;  Ruth 4:11 ). It was also called Beth-lehem Ephratah ( Micah 5:2 ), Beth-lehem-judah ( 1 Samuel 17:12 ), and "the city of David" ( Luke 2:4 ). It is first noticed in Scripture as the place where Rachel died and was buried "by the wayside," directly to the north of the city ( Genesis 48:7 ). The valley to the east was the scene of the story of Ruth the Moabitess. There are the fields in which she gleaned, and the path by which she and Naomi returned to the town. Here was David's birth-place, and here also, in after years, he was anointed as king by Samuel ( 1 Samuel 16:4-13 ); and it was from the well of Bethlehem that three of his heroes brought water for him at the risk of their lives when he was in the cave of Adullam ( 2 Samuel 23:13-17 ). But it was distinguished above every other city as the birth-place of "Him whose goings forth have been of old" ( Matthew 2:6 ; Compare  Micah 5:2 ). Afterwards Herod, "when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men," sent and slew "all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under" ( Matthew 2:16 Matthew 2:18 ;  Jeremiah 31:15 ).  <p> Bethlehem bears the modern name of Beit-Lahm, i.e., "house of flesh." It is about 5 miles south of Jerusalem, standing at an elevation of about 2,550 feet above the sea, thus 100 feet higher than Jerusalem.  </p><p> There is a church still existing, built by Constantine the Great (A.D. 330), called the "Church of the Nativity," over a grotto or cave called the "holy crypt," and said to be the "stable" in which Jesus was born. This is perhaps the oldest existing Christian church in the world. Close to it is another grotto, where Jerome the Latin father is said to have spent thirty years of his life in translating the Scriptures into Latin. (See VERSION .) </p></li><li> A city of Zebulun, mentioned only in  Joshua 19:15 . Now Beit-Lahm, a ruined village about 6 miles west-north-west of Nazareth.   </li>
Beth-peor	<p>house of Peor; i.e., "temple of Baal-peor", a place in Moab, on the east of Jordan, opposite Jericho. It was in the tribe of Reuben ( Joshua 13:20 ;  Deuteronomy 3:29 ;  4:46 ). In the "ravine" or valley over against Beth-peor Moses was probably buried ( Deuteronomy 34:6 ).  </p>
Beth-phage	<p>house of the unripe fig, a village on the Mount of Olives, on the road from Jerusalem to Jericho ( Matthew 21:1 ;  Mark 11:1 ;  Luke 19:29 ), and very close to Bethany. It was the limit of a Sabbath-day's journey from Jerusalem, i.e., 2,000 cubits. It has been identified with the modern Kefr-et-Tur.  </p>
Bethsaida	<p>house of fish. </p><li> A town in Galilee, on the west side of the sea of Tiberias, in the "land of Gennesaret." It was the native place of Peter, Andrew, and Philip, and was frequently resorted to by Jesus ( Mark 6:45 ;  John 1:44 ;  12:21 ). It is supposed to have been at the modern 'Ain Tabighah, a bay to the north of Gennesaret.  </li><li> A city near which Christ fed 5,000 ( Luke 9:10 ; Compare  John 6:17 ;  Matthew 14:15-21 ), and where the blind man had his sight restored ( Mark 8:22 ), on the east side of the lake, two miles up the Jordan. It stood within the region of Gaulonitis, and was enlarged by Philip the tetrarch, who called it "Julias," after the emperor's daughter. Or, as some have supposed, there may have been but one Bethsaida built on both sides of the lake, near where the Jordan enters it. Now the ruins et-Tel.   </li>
Beth-shean	<p>house of security or rest, a city which belonged to Manasseh ( 1 Chronicles 7:29 ), on the west of Jordan. The bodies of Saul and his sons were fastened to its walls. In Solomon's time it gave its name to a district ( 1 Kings 4:12 ). The name is found in an abridged form, Bethshan, in 1Sam 31:10,12and  2 Samuel 21:12 . It is on the road from Jerusalem to Damascus, about 5 miles from the Jordan, and 14 from the south end of the Lake of Gennesaret. After the Captivity it was called Scythopolis, i.e., "the city of the Scythians," who about B.C. 640 came down from the steppes of Southern Russia and settled in different places in Syria. It is now called Beisan.  </p>
Beth-shemesh	<p>house of the sun. </p><li> A sacerdotal city in the tribe of Dan ( Joshua 21:16 ;  1 Samuel 6:15 ), on the north border of Judah ( Joshua 15:10 ). It was the scene of an encounter between Jehoash, king of Israel, and Amaziah, king of Judah, in which the latter was made prisoner ( 2 Kings 14:11 2 Kings 14:13 ). It was afterwards taken by the Philistines ( 2 Chronicles 28:18 ). It is the modern ruined Arabic village 'Ain-shems, on the north-west slopes of the mountains of Judah, 14 miles west of Jerusalem.  </li><li> A city between Dothan and the Jordan, near the southern border of Issachar ( Joshua 19:22 ),  7  1/2 miles south of Beth-shean. It is the modern Ain-esh-Shemsiyeh.  </li><li> One of the fenced cities of Naphtali ( Joshua 19:38 ), between Mount Tabor and the Jordan. Now Khurbet Shema, 3 miles west of Safed. But perhaps the same as No. 2.  </li><li> An idol sanctuary in Egypt ( Jeremiah 43:13 ); called by the Greeks Heliopolis, and by the Egyptians On (q.v.),  Genesis 41:45 .   </li>
Beth-tappuah	<p>house of apples, a town of Judah, now Tuffuh, 5 miles west of Hebron ( Joshua 15:53 ).  </p>
Bethuel	<p>man of God, or virgin of God, or house of God. </p><li> The son of Nahor by Milcah; nephew of Abraham, and father of Rebekah ( Genesis 22:22 Genesis 22:23 ;  Genesis 24:15 Genesis 24:24 Genesis 24:47 ). He appears in person only once ( 24:50 ).  </li><li> A southern city of Judah ( 1 Chronicles 4:30 ); called also Bethul ( Joshua 19:4 ) and Bethel ( 12:16 ;  1 Samuel 30:27 ).   </li>
Bethzur	<p>house of rock, a town in the mountains of Judah ( Joshua 15:58 ), about 4 miles to the north of Hebron. It was built by Rehoboam for the defence of his kingdom ( 2 Chronicles 11:7 ). It stood near the modern ed-Dirweh. Its ruins are still seen on a hill which bears the name of Beit-Sur, and which commands the road from Beer-sheba and Hebron to Jerusalem from the south.  </p>
Betroth	<p>to promise "by one's truth." Men and women were betrothed when they were engaged to be married. This usually took place a year or more before marriage. From the time of betrothal the woman was regarded as the lawful wife of the man to whom she was betrothed ( Deuteronomy 28:30 ;  Judges 14:2 Judges 14:8 ;  Matthew 1:18-21 ). The term is figuratively employed of the spiritual connection between God and his people ( Hosea 2:19 Hosea 2:20 ).  </p>
Beulah	<p>married, is used in  Isaiah 62:4  metaphorically as the name of Judea: "Thy land shall be married," i.e., favoured and blessed of the Lord.  </p>
Bewray	<p>to reveal or disclose; an old English word equivalent to "betray" ( Proverbs 27:16 ;  29:24 , RSV, "uttereth;"  Isaiah 16:3 ;  Matthew 26:73 ).  </p>
Beyond	<p>when used with reference to Jordan, signifies in the writings of Moses the west side of the river, as he wrote on the east bank ( Genesis 50:10 Genesis 50:11 ;  Deuteronomy 1:1 Deuteronomy 1:5 ;  Deuteronomy 3:8 Deuteronomy 3:20 ;  4:46 ); but in the writings of Joshua, after he had crossed the river, it means the east side ( Joshua 5:1 ;  12:7 ;  22:7 ).  </p>
Bezaleel	<p>in the shadow of God; i.e., "under his protection", the artificer who executed the work of art in connection with the tabernacle in the wilderness ( Exodus 31:2 ;  35:30 ). He was engaged principally in works of metal, wood, and stone; while Aholiab, who was associated with him and subordinate to him, had the charge of the textile fabrics ( Exodus 36:1 Exodus 36:2 ;  38:22 ). He was of the tribe of Judah, the son of Uri, and grandson of Hur ( 31:2 ). Mention is made in  Ezra 10:30  of another of the same name.  </p>
Bezek	<p>lightning. </p><li> The residence of Adoni-bezek, in the lot of Judah ( Judges 1:5 ). It was in the mountains, not far from Jerusalem. Probably the modern Bezkah, 6 miles south-east of Lydda.  </li><li> The place where Saul numbered the forces of Israel and Judah ( 1 Samuel 11:8 ); somewhere in the centre of the country, near the Jordan valley. Probably the modern Ibzik, 13 miles north-east of Shechem.   </li>
Bezer	<p>ore of gold or silver. </p><li> A city of the Reubenites; one of the three cities of refuge on the east of Jordan ( Deuteronomy 4: :  43 ;  Joshua 20:8 ). It has been identified with the modern ruined village of Burazin, some 12 miles north of Heshbon; also with Kasur-el-Besheir, 2 miles south-west of Dibon.  </li><li> A descendant of Asher ( 1 Chronicles 7:37 ).   </li>
Bible	<p>Bible, the English form of the Greek name <i> Biblia</i> , meaning "books," the name which in the fifth century began to be given to the entire collection of sacred books, the "Library of Divine Revelation." The name Bible was adopted by Wickliffe, and came gradually into use in our English language. The Bible consists of sixty-six different books, composed by many different writers, in three different languages, under different circumstances; writers of almost every social rank, statesmen and peasants, kings, herdsmen, fishermen, priests, tax-gatherers, tentmakers; educated and uneducated, Jews and Gentiles; most of them unknown to each other, and writing at various periods during the space of about 1600 years: and yet, after all, it is only one book dealing with only one subject in its numberless aspects and relations, the subject of man's redemption.  </p><p> It is divided into the Old Testament, containing thirty-nine books, and the New Testament, containing twenty-seven books. The names given to the Old in the writings of the New are "the scriptures" ( Matthew 21:42 ), "scripture" ( 2 Peter 1:20 ), "the holy scriptures" ( Romans 1:2 ), "the law" ( John 12:34 ), "the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms" ( Luke 24:44 ), "the law and the prophets" ( Matthew 5:17 ), "the old covenant" ( 2 Corinthians 3:14 , RSV). There is a break of 400 years between the Old Testament and the New. (See APOCRYPHA .) </p><p> The Old Testament is divided into three parts:, 1. The Law (Torah), consisting of the Pentateuch, or five books of Moses. 2. The Prophets, consisting of (1) the former, namely, Joshua, Judges, the Books of Samuel, and the Books of Kings; (2) the latter, namely, the greater prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, and the twelve minor prophets. 3. The Hagiographa, or holy writings, including the rest of the books. These were ranked in three divisions:, (1) The Psalms, Proverbs, and Job, distinguished by the Hebrew name, a word formed of the initial letters of these books, <i> emeth</i> , meaning truth. (2) Canticles, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, and Esther, called the five rolls, as being written for the synagogue use on five separate rolls. (3) Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, and 1 and 2Chronicles. Between the Old and the New Testament no addition was made to the revelation God had already given. The period of New Testament revelation, extending over a century, began with the appearance of John the Baptist.  </p><p> The New Testament consists of (1) the historical books, viz., the Gospels, and the Acts of the Apostles; (2) the Epistles; and (3) the book of prophecy, the Revelation.  </p><p> The division of the Bible into chapters and verses is altogether of human invention, designed to facilitate reference to it. The ancient Jews divided the Old Testament into certain sections for use in the synagogue service, and then at a later period, in the ninth century A.D., into verses. Our modern system of chapters for all the books of the Bible was introduced by Cardinal Hugo about the middle of the thirteenth century (he died 1263). The system of verses for the New Testament was introduced by Stephens in 1551, and generally adopted, although neither Tyndale's nor Coverdale's English translation of the Bible has verses. The division is not always wisely made, yet it is very useful. (See VERSION .) </p>
Bier	<p>the frame on which dead bodies were conveyed to the grave ( Luke 7:14 ).  </p>
Bigtha	<p>garden, or gift of fortune, one of the seven eunuchs or chamberlains who had charge of the harem of Ahasuerus ( Esther 1:10 ).  </p>
Bigthan	<p>one of the eunuchs who "kept the door" in the court of Ahasuerus. With Teresh he conspired against the king's life. Mordecai detected the conspiracy, and the culprits were hanged ( Esther 2:21-23 ;  6:1-3 ).  </p>
Bildad	<p>son of contention, one of Job's friends. He is called "the Shuhite," probably as belonging to Shuah, a district in Arabia, in which Shuah, the sixth son of Abraham by Keturah, settled ( Genesis 25:2 ). He took part in each of the three controversies into which Job's friends entered with him ( Job 8:1 ;  18:1 ;  25:1 ), and delivered three speeches, very severe and stern in their tone, although less violent than those of Zophar, but more so than those of Eliphaz.  </p>
Bilgah	<p>cheerful. </p><li> The head of the fifteenth sacerdotal course for the temple service ( 1 Chronicles 24:14 ). </li><li> A priest who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel ( Nehemiah 12:5 Nehemiah 12:18 ).   </li>
Bilhah	<p>faltering; bashful, Rachel's handmaid, whom she gave to Jacob ( Genesis 29:29 ). She was the mother of Dan and Naphtali ( Genesis 30:3-8 ). Reuben was cursed by his father for committing adultry with her ( 35:22 ;  49:4 ). He was deprived of the birth-right, which was given to the sons of Joseph.  </p>
Bilshan	<p>son of the tongue; i.e., "eloquent", a man of some note who returned from the Captivity with Zerubbabel ( Ezra 2:2 ;  Nehemiah 7:7 ).  </p>
Bird	<p>Birds are divided in the Mosaic law into two classes, (1) the clean ( Leviticus 1:14-17 ;  5:7-10 ;  14:4-7 ), which were offered in sacrifice; and (2) the unclean ( Leviticus 11:13-20 ). When offered in sacrifice, they were not divided as other victims were ( Genesis 15:10 ). They are mentioned also as an article of food ( Deuteronomy 14:11 ). The art of snaring wild birds is referred to ( Psalms 124:7 ;  Proverbs 1:17 ;  7:23 ;  Jeremiah 5:27 ). Singing birds are mentioned in  Psalms 104:12 ; Eccl  12:4 . Their timidity is alluded to ( Hosea 11:11 ). The reference in  Psalms 84:3  to the swallow and the sparrow may be only a comparison equivalent to, "What her house is to the sparrow, and her nest to the swallow, that thine altars are to my soul."  </p>
Birsha	<p>son of wickedness, a king of Gomorrah whom Abraham succoured in the invasion of Chedorlaomer ( Genesis 14:2 ).  </p>
Birth	<p>As soon as a child was born it was washed, and rubbed with salt ( Ezekiel 16:4 ), and then swathed with bandages ( Job 38:9 ;  Luke 2:7 Luke 2:12 ). A Hebrew mother remained forty days in seclusion after the birth of a son, and after the birth of a daughter double that number of days. At the close of that period she entered into the tabernacle or temple and offered up a sacrifice of purification ( Leviticus 12:1-8 ;  Luke 2:22 ). A son was circumcised on the eighth day after his birth, being thereby consecrated to God ( Genesis 17:10-12 ; Compare  Romans 4:11 ). Seasons of misfortune are likened to the pains of a woman in travail, and seasons of prosperity to the joy that succeeds child-birth ( Isaiah 13:8 ;  Jeremiah 4:31 ;  John 16:21 John 16:22 ). The natural birth is referred to as the emblem of the new birth ( John 3:3-8 ;  Galatians 6:15 ;  Titus 3:5 , etc.).  </p>
Birth-day	<p>The observance of birth-days was common in early times ( Job 1:4 Job 1:13 Job 1:18 ). They were specially celebrated in the land of Egypt ( Genesis 40:20 ). There is no recorded instance in Scripture of the celebration of birth-days among the Jews. On the occasion of Herod's birth-day John the Baptist was beheaded ( Matthew 14:6 ).  </p>
Birthright	<p></p><li> This word denotes the special privileges and advantages belonging to the first-born son among the Jews. He became the priest of the family. Thus Reuben was the first-born of the patriarchs, and so the priesthood of the tribes belonged to him. That honour was, however, transferred by God from Reuben to Levi ( Numbers 3:12 Numbers 3:13 ;  8:18 ).  </li><li> The first-born son had allotted to him also a double portion of the paternal inheritance ( Deuteronomy 21:15-17 ). Reuben was, because of his undutiful conduct, deprived of his birth-right ( Genesis 49:4 ;  1 Chronicles 5:1 ). Esau transferred his birth-right to Jacob ( Genesis 25:33 ).  </li><li> The first-born inherited the judicial authority of his father, whatever it might be ( 2 Chronicles 21:3 ). By divine appointment, however, David excluded Adonijah in favour of Solomon.  </li><li> The Jews attached a sacred importance to the rank of "first-born" and "first-begotten" as applied to the Messiah ( Romans 8:29 ;  Colossians 1:18 ;  Hebrews 1:4-6 ). As first-born he has an inheritance superior to his brethren, and is the alone true priest.   </li>
Bishop	<p>an overseer. In apostolic times, it is quite manifest that there was no difference as to order between bishops and elders or presbyters ( Acts 20:17-28 ;  1 Peter 5:1 1 Peter 5:2 ; Phil  1:1 ;  1 Timothy 3 ). The term bishop is never once used to denote a different office from that of elder or presbyter. These different names are simply titles of the same office, "bishop" designating the function, namely, that of oversight, and "presbyter" the dignity appertaining to the office. Christ is figuratively called "the bishop [episcopos] of souls" ( 1 Peter 2:25 ).  </p>
Bit	<p>the curb put into the mouths of horses to restrain them. The Hebrew word (metheg) so rendered in  Psalms 32:9  is elsewhere translated "bridle" ( 2 Kings 19:28 ;  Proverbs 26:3 ;  Isaiah 37:29 ). Bits were generally made of bronze or iron, but sometimes also of gold or silver. In  James 3:3  the Authorized Version translates the Greek word by "bits," but the Revised Version by "bridles."  </p>
Bith-ron	<p>the broken or divided place, a district in the Arabah or Jordan valley, on the east of the river ( 2 Samuel 2:29 ). It was probably the designation of the region in general, which is broken and intersected by ravines.  </p>
Bithynia	<p>a province in Asia Minor, to the south of the Euxine and Propontis. Christian congregations were here formed at an early time ( 1 Peter 1:1 ). Paul was prevented by the Spirit from entering this province ( Acts 16:7 ). It is noted in church history as the province ruled over by Pliny as Roman proconsul, who was perplexed as to the course he should take with the numerous Christians brought before his tribunal on account of their profession of Christianity and their conduct, and wrote to Trajan, the emperor, for instructions (A.D. 107).  </p>
Bitter	<p>Bitterness is symbolical of affliction, misery, and servitude ( Exodus 1:14 ;  Ruth 1:20 ;  Jeremiah 9:15 ). The Chaldeans are called the "bitter and hasty nation" ( Habakkuk 1:6 ). The "gall of bitterness" expresses a state of great wickedness ( Acts 8:23 ). A "root of bitterness" is a wicked person or a dangerous sin ( Hebrews 12:15 ).  </p><p> The Passover was to be eaten with "bitter herbs" ( Exodus 12:8 ;  Numbers 9:11 ). The kind of herbs so designated is not known. Probably they were any bitter herbs obtainable at the place and time when the Passover was celebrated. They represented the severity of the servitude under which the people groaned; and have been regarded also as typical of the sufferings of Christ.  </p>
Bittern	<p>is found three times in connection with the desolations to come upon Babylon, Idumea, and Nineveh ( Isaiah 14:23 ;  34:11 ;  Zephaniah 2:14 ). This bird belongs to the class of cranes. Its scientific name is Botaurus stellaris. It is a solitary bird, frequenting marshy ground. The Hebrew word (kippod) thus rendered in the Authorized Version is rendered "porcupine" in the Revised Version. But in the passages noted the kippod is associated with birds, with pools of water, and with solitude and desolation. This favours the idea that not the "porcupine" but the "bittern" is really intended by the word.  </p>
Bitumen	<p> Genesis 11:3 , RSV, margin, rendered in the A.V. "slime"), a mineral pitch. With this the ark was pitched ( 6:14 . See also  Exodus 2:3 .) (SeeSLIME .) </p>
Black	<p>properly the absence of all colour. In  Proverbs 7:9  the Hebrew word means, as in the margin of the Revised Version, "the pupil of the eye." It is translated "apple" of the eye in  Deuteronomy 32:10 ;  Psalms 17:8 ;  Proverbs 7:2 . It is a different word which is rendered "black" in  Leviticus 13:31 Leviticus 13:37 ; Cant  1:5 ;  5:11 ; and  Zechariah 6:2 Zechariah 6:6 . It is uncertain what the "black marble" of  Esther 1:6  was which formed a part of the mosaic pavement.  </p>
Blade	<p>applied to the glittering point of a spear ( Job 39:23 ) or sword ( Nahum 3:3 ), the blade of a dagger ( Judges 3:22 ); the "shoulder blade" ( Job 31:22 ); the "blade" of cereals ( Matthew 13:26 ).  </p>
Blains	<p>occurs only in connection with the sixth plague of Egypt ( Exodus 9:9 Exodus 9:10 ). In  Deuteronomy 28:27 Deuteronomy 28:35 , it is called "the botch of Egypt." It seems to have been the fearful disease of black leprosy, a kind of elephantiasis, producing burning ulcers.  </p>
Blasphemy	<p>In the sense of speaking evil of God this word is found in  Psalms 74:18 ;  Isaiah 52:5 ;  Romans 2:24 ;  Revelation 13:1 Revelation 13:6 ;  Revelation 16:9 Revelation 16:11 Revelation 16:21 . It denotes also any kind of calumny, or evil-speaking, or abuse ( 1 Kings 21:10 ;  Acts 13:45 ;  18:6 , etc.). Our Lord was accused of blasphemy when he claimed to be the Son of God ( Matthew 26:65 ; Compare  Matthew 9:3 ;  Mark 2:7 ). They who deny his Messiahship blaspheme Jesus ( Luke 22:65 ;  John 10:36 ).  </p><p> Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost ( Matthew 12:31 Matthew 12:32 ;  Mark 3:28 Mark 3:29 ;  Luke 12:10 ) is regarded by some as a continued and obstinate rejection of the gospel, and hence is an unpardonable sin, simply because as long as a sinner remains in unbelief he voluntarily excludes himself from pardon. Others regard the expression as designating the sin of attributing to the power of Satan those miracles which Christ performed, or generally those works which are the result of the Spirit's agency.  </p>
Blastus	<p>chamberlain to king Herod Agrippa I. ( Acts 12:20 ). Such persons generally had great influence with their masters.  </p>
Blemish	<p>imperfection or bodily deformity excluding men from the priesthood, and rendering animals unfit to be offered in sacrifice ( Leviticus 21:17-23 ;  22:19-25 ). The Christian church, as justified in Christ, is "without blemish" ( Ephesians 5:27 ). Christ offered himself a sacrifice "without blemish," acceptable to God ( 1 Peter 1:19 ).  </p>
Bless	<p></p><li> God blesses his people when he bestows on them some gift temporal or spiritual ( Genesis 1:22 ;  24:35 ;  Job 42:12 ;  Psalms 45:2 ;  Psalms 104:24 Psalms 104:35 ).  </li><li> We bless God when we thank him for his mercies ( Psalms 103:1 Psalms 103:2 ;  Psalms 145:1 Psalms 145:2 ).  </li><li> A man blesses himself when he invokes God's blessing ( Isaiah 65:16 ), or rejoices in God's goodness to him ( Deuteronomy 29:19 ;  Psalms 49:18 ).  </li><li> One blesses another when he expresses good wishes or offers prayer to God for his welfare ( Genesis 24:60 ;  31:55 ;  1 Samuel 2:20 ). Sometimes blessings were uttered under divine inspiration, as in the case of Noah, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses ( Genesis 9:26 Genesis 9:27 ;  Genesis 27:28 Genesis 27:29 Genesis 27:40 ;  48:15-20 ;  49:1-28 ;  Deuteronomy 33 ). The priests were divinely authorized to bless the people ( Deuteronomy 10:8 ;  Numbers 6:22-27 ). We have many examples of apostolic benediction ( 2 Corinthians 13:14 ;  Ephesians 6:23 Ephesians 6:24 ;  2 th  Ephesians 3:16 Ephesians 3:18 ;  Hebrews 13:20 Hebrews 13:21 ;  1 Peter 5:10 1 Peter 5:11 ).  </li><li> Among the Jews in their thank-offerings the master of the feast took a cup of wine in his hand, and after having blessed God for it and for other mercies then enjoyed, handed it to his guests, who all partook of it.  Psalms 116:13  refers to this custom. It is also alluded to in  1 Corinthians 10:16 , where the apostle speaks of the "cup of blessing."   </li>
Blind	<p>Blind beggars are frequently mentioned ( Matthew 9:27 ;  12:22 ;  20:30 ;  John 5:3 ). The blind are to be treated with compassion ( Leviticus 19:14 ;  Deuteronomy 27:18 ). Blindness was sometimes a punishment for disobedience ( 1 Samuel 11:2 ;  Jeremiah 39:7 ), sometimes the effect of old age ( Genesis 27:1 ;  1 Kings 14:4 ;  1 Samuel 4:15 ). Conquerors sometimes blinded their captives ( 2 Kings 25:7 ;  1 Samuel 11:2 ). Blindness denotes ignorance as to spiritual things ( Isaiah 6:10 ;  Isaiah 42:18 Isaiah 42:19 ;  Matthew 15:14 ;  Ephesians 4:18 ). The opening of the eyes of the blind is peculiar to the Messiah ( Isaiah 29:18 ). Elymas was smitten with blindness at Paul's word ( Acts 13:11 ).  </p>
Blood	<p></p><li> As food, prohibited in  Genesis 9:4 , where the use of animal food is first allowed. Compare  Deuteronomy 12:23 ;  Leviticus 3:17 ;  7:26 ;  17:10-14 . The injunction to abstain from blood is renewed in the decree of the council of Jerusalem ( Acts 15:29 ). It has been held by some, and we think correctly, that this law of prohibition was only ceremonial and temporary; while others regard it as still binding on all. Blood was eaten by the Israelites after the battle of Gilboa ( 1 Samuel 14:32-34 ).  </li><li> The blood of sacrifices was caught by the priest in a basin, and then sprinkled seven times on the altar; that of the passover on the doorposts and lintels of the houses ( Exodus 12 ;  Leviticus 4:5-7 ;  16:14-19 ). At the giving of the law ( Exodus 24:8 ) the blood of the sacrifices was sprinkled on the people as well as on the altar, and thus the people were consecrated to God, or entered into covenant with him, hence the blood of the covenant ( Matthew 26:28 ;  Hebrews 9:19 Hebrews 9:20 ;  10:29 ;  13:20 ).  </li><li> Human blood. The murderer was to be punished ( Genesis 9:5 ). The blood of the murdered "crieth for vengeance" ( Genesis 4:10 ). The "avenger of blood" was the nearest relative of the murdered, and he was required to avenge his death ( Numbers 35:24 Numbers 35:27 ). No satisfaction could be made for the guilt of murder ( Numbers 35:31 ).  </li><li> Blood used metaphorically to denote race ( Acts 17:26 ), and as a symbol of slaughter ( Isaiah 34:3 ). To "wash the feet in blood" means to gain a great victory ( Psalms 58:10 ). Wine, from its red colour, is called "the blood of the grape" ( Genesis 49:11 ). Blood and water issued from our Saviour's side when it was pierced by the Roman soldier ( John 19:34 ). This has led pathologists to the conclusion that the proper cause of Christ's death was rupture of the heart. (Compare  Psalms 69:20 .)   </li>
Bloody sweat	<p>the sign and token of our Lord's great agony ( Luke 22:44 ).  </p>
Blot	<p>a stain or reproach ( Job 31:7 ;  Proverbs 9:7 ). To blot out sin is to forgive it ( Psalms 51:1 Psalms 51:9 ;  Isaiah 44:22 ;  Acts 3:19 ). Christ's blotting out the handwriting of ordinances was his fulfilling the law in our behalf ( Colossians 2:14 ).  </p>
Blue	<p>generally associated with purple ( Exodus 25:4 ;  Exodus 26:1 Exodus 26:31 Exodus 26:36 , etc.). It is supposed to have been obtained from a shellfish of the Mediterranean, the Helix ianthina of Linnaeus. The robe of the high priest's ephod was to be all of this colour ( Exodus 28:31 ), also the loops of the curtains ( 26:4 ) and the ribbon of the breastplate ( 28:28 ). Blue cloths were also made for various sacred purposes ( Numbers 4:6 Numbers 4:7 Numbers 4:9 Numbers 4:11 Numbers 4:12 ). (See COLOUR .) </p>
Boanerges	<p>sons of thunder, a surname given by our Lord to James and John ( Mark 3:17 ) on account of their fervid and impetuous temper ( Luke 9:54 ).  </p>
Boar	<p>occurs only in  Psalms 80:13 . The same Hebrew word is elsewhere rendered "swine" ( Leviticus 11:7 ;  Deuteronomy 14:8 ;  Proverbs 11:22 ;  Isaiah 65:4 ;  Isaiah 66:3 Isaiah 66:17 ). The Hebrews abhorred swine's flesh, and accordingly none of these animals were reared, except in the district beyond the Sea of Galilee. In the psalm quoted above the powers that destroyed the Jewish nation are compared to wild boars and wild beasts of the field.  </p>
Boaz	<p>alacrity. </p><li> The husband of Ruth, a wealthy Bethlehemite. By the "levirate law" the duty devolved on him of marrying Ruth the Moabitess ( Ruth 4:1-13 ). He was a kinsman of Mahlon, her first husband.  </li><li> The name given (for what reason is unknown) to one of the two (the other was called Jachin) brazen pillars which Solomon erected in the court of the temple ( 1 Kings 7:21 ;  2 Chr  3:17 ). These pillars were broken up and carried to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar.   </li>
Bochim	<p>weepers, a place where the angel of the Lord reproved the Israelites for entering into a league with the people of the land. This caused them bitterly to weep, and hence the name of the place ( Judges 2:1 Judges 2:5 ). It lay probably at the head of one of the valleys between Gilgal and Shiloh.  </p>
Boil	<p>(rendered "botch" in  Deuteronomy 28:27 Deuteronomy 28:35 ), an aggravated ulcer, as in the case of Hezekiah ( 2 Kings 20:7 ;  Isaiah 38:21 ) or of the Egyptians ( Exodus 9:9 Exodus 9:10 Exodus 9:11 ;  Deuteronomy 28:27 Deuteronomy 28:35 ). It designates the disease of ( Job 2:7 ), which was probably the black leprosy.  </p>
Bolled	<p>( Exodus 9:31 ), meaning "swollen or podded for seed," was adopted in the Authorized Version from the version of Coverdale (1535). The Revised Version has in the margin "was in bloom," which is the more probable rendering of the Hebrew word. It is the fact that in Egypt when barley is in ear (about February) flax is blossoming.  </p>
Bolster	<p>The Hebrew word <i> kebir</i> , rendered "pillow" in  1 Samuel 19:13 1 Samuel 19:16 , but in Revised Version marg. "quilt" or "network," probably means some counterpane or veil intended to protect the head of the sleeper. A different Hebrew word (meraashoth') is used for "bolster" ( 1 Samuel 26:7 1 Samuel 26:11 1 Samuel 26:16 ). It is rightly rendered in Revised Version "at his head." In Gen 28:11,18the Authorized Version renders it "for his pillows," and the Revised Version "under his head." In Eze 13:18,20another Hebrew word (kesathoth) is used, properly denoting "cushions" or "pillows," as so rendered both in the Authorized and the Revised Version.  </p>
Bond	<p>an obligation of any kind ( Numbers 30:2 Numbers 30:4 Numbers 30:12 ). The word means also oppression or affliction ( Psalms 116:16 ; Phil  <span class="badLink">1:7</span> ). Christian love is the "bond of perfectness" ( Colossians 3:14 ), and the influences of the Spirit are the "bond of peace" ( Ephesians 4:3 ).  </p>
Bondage	<p>of Israel in Egypt ( Exodus 2:23 Exodus 2:25 ;  5 ), which is called the "house of bondage" ( 13:3 ;  20:2 ). This word is used also with reference to the captivity in Babylon ( Isaiah 14:3 ), and the oppression of the Persian king ( Ezra 9:8 Ezra 9:9 ).  </p>
Bonnet	<p>(Heb. peer),  Exodus 39:28  (RSV, "head-tires");  Ezekiel 44:18  (RSV, "tires"), denotes properly a turban worn by priests, and in  Isaiah 3:20  (RSV, "head-tires") a head-dress or tiara worn by females. The Hebrew word so rendered literally means an ornament, as in  Isaiah 61:10  (RSV, "garland"), and in Eze 24:17,23"tire" (RSV, "head-tire"). It consisted of a piece of cloth twisted about the head. In  Exodus 28:40 ;  29:9  it is the translation of a different Hebrew word (migba'ah), which denotes the turban (RSV, "head-tire") of the common priest as distinguished from the mitre of the high priest. (See MITRE .) </p>
Book	<p>This word has a comprehensive meaning in Scripture. In the Old Testament it is the rendering of the Hebrew word <i> sepher</i> , which properly means a "writing," and then a "volume" ( Exodus 17:14 ;  Deuteronomy 28:58 ;  29:20 ;  Job 19:23 ) or "roll of a book" ( Jeremiah 36:2 Jeremiah 36:4 ).  </p><p> Books were originally written on skins, on linen or cotton cloth, and on Egyptian papyrus, whence our word "paper." The leaves of the book were generally written in columns, designated by a Hebrew word properly meaning "doors" and "valves" ( Jeremiah 36:23 , RSV, marg. "columns").  </p><p> Among the Hebrews books were generally rolled up like our maps, or if very long they were rolled from both ends, forming two rolls ( Luke 4:17-20 ). Thus they were arranged when the writing was on flexible materials; but if the writing was on tablets of wood or brass or lead, then the several tablets were bound together by rings through which a rod was passed.  </p><p> A sealed book is one whose contents are secret ( Isaiah 29:11 ;  Revelation 5:1-3 ). To "eat" a book ( Jeremiah 15:16 ;  Ezekiel 2:8-10 ;  3:1-3 ;  Revelation 10:9 ) is to study its contents carefully.  </p><p> The book of judgment ( Daniel 7:10 ) refers to the method of human courts of justice as illustrating the proceedings which will take place at the day of God's final judgment.  </p><p> The book of the wars of the Lord ( Numbers 21:14 ), the book of Jasher ( Joshua 10:13 ), and the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah and Israel ( 2 Chronicles 25:26 ), were probably ancient documents known to the Hebrews, but not forming a part of the canon.  </p><p> The book of life ( Psalms 69:28 ) suggests the idea that as the redeemed form a community or citizenship (Phil  3:20 ;  4:3 ), a catalogue of the citizens' names is preserved ( Luke 10:20 ;  Revelation 20:15 ). Their names are registered in heaven ( Luke 10:20 ;  Revelation 3:5 ).  </p><p> The book of the covenant ( Exodus 24:7 ), containing  Exodus 20:22-23:33, , is the first book actually mentioned as a part of the written word. It contains a series of laws, civil, social, and religious, given to Moses at Sinai immediately after the delivery of the decalogue. These were written in this "book."  </p>
Booth	<p>a hut made of the branches of a tree. In such tabernacles Jacob sojourned for a season at a place named from this circumstance Succoth ( Genesis 33:17 ). Booths were erected also at the feast of Tabernacles (q.v.),  Leviticus 23:42 Leviticus 23:43 , which commemorated the abode of the Israelites in the wilderness.  </p>
Booty	<p>captives or cattle or objects of value taken in war. In Canaan all that breathed were to be destroyed ( Deuteronomy 20: :  16 ). The "pictures and images" of the Canaanites were to be destroyed also ( Numbers 33:52 ). The law of booty as to its division is laid down in  Numbers 31:26-47 . David afterwards introduced a regulation that the baggage-guard should share the booty equally with the soldiers engaged in battle. He also devoted of the spoils of war for the temple ( 1 Samuel 30:24-26 ;  2 Sam  8:11 ;  1 Chronicles 26:27 ).  </p>
Borrow	<p>The Israelites "borrowed" from the Egyptians ( Exodus 12:35 , RSV, "asked") in accordance with a divine command ( 3:22 ;  11:2 ). But the word (sha'al) so rendered here means simply and always to "request" or "demand." The Hebrew had another word which is properly translated "borrow" in  Deuteronomy 28:12 ;  Psalms 37:21 . It was well known that the parting was final. The Egyptians were so anxious to get the Israelites away out of their land that "they let them have what they asked" ( Exodus 12:36 , RSV), or literally "made them to ask," urged them to take whatever they desired and depart. (See LOAN .) </p>
Bosom	<p>In the East objects are carried in the bosom which Europeans carry in the pocket. To have in one's bosom indicates kindness, secrecy, or intimacy ( Genesis 16:5 ;  2 Sam  12:8 ). Christ is said to have been in "the bosom of the Father," i.e., he had the most perfect knowledge of the Father, had the closest intimacy with him ( John 1:18 ). ( John 13:23 ) was "leaning on Jesus' bosom" at the last supper. Our Lord carries his lambs in his bosom, i.e., has a tender, watchful care over them ( Isaiah 40:11 ).  </p>
Bosor	<p>the Chaldee or Aramaic form of the name Beor, the father of Balaam ( 2 Peter 2:15 ).  </p>
Bosses	<p>the projecting parts of a shield ( Job 15:26 ). The Hebrew word thus rendered means anything convex or arched, and hence the back, as of animals.  </p>
Botch	<p>the name given in De 28:27,35to one of the Egyptian plagues ( Exodus 9:9 ). The word so translated is usually rendered "boil" (q.v.).  </p>
Bottle	<p>a vessel made of skins for holding wine ( Joshua 9:4 .  13 ;  1 Samuel 16:20 ;  Matthew 9:17 ;  Mark 2:22 ;  Luke 5:37 Luke 5:38 ), or milk (Judg.  4:19 ), or water ( Genesis 21:14 Genesis 21:15 Genesis 21:19 ), or strong drink ( Habakkuk 2:15 ).  </p><p> Earthenware vessels were also similarly used ( Jeremiah 19:1-10 ;  1 Kings 14:3 ;  Isaiah 30:14 ). In  Job 32:19  (Compare  Matthew 9:17 ;  Luke 5:37 Luke 5:38 ;  Mark 2:22 ) the reference is to a wine-skin ready to burst through the fermentation of the wine. "Bottles of wine" in the Authorized Version of  Hosea 7:5  is properly rendered in the Revised Version by "the heat of wine," i.e., the fever of wine, its intoxicating strength.  </p><p> The clouds are figuratively called the "bottles of heaven" ( Job 38:37 ). A bottle blackened or shrivelled by smoke is referred to in  Psalms 119:83  as an image to which the psalmist likens himself.  </p>
Bow	<p>The bow was in use in early times both in war and in the chase ( Genesis 21:20 ;  27:3 ;  48:22 ). The tribe of Benjamin were famous for the use of the bow ( 1 Chronicles 8:40 ;  12:2 ;  2 Chr  14:8 ;  17:17 ); so also were the Elamites ( Isaiah 22:6 ) and the Lydians ( Jeremiah 46:9 ). The Hebrew word commonly used for bow means properly to tread ( 1 Chronicles 5:18 ;  8:40 ), and hence it is concluded that the foot was employed in bending the bow. Bows of steel (correctly "copper") are mentioned ( 2 Samuel 22:35 ;  Psalms 18:34 ).  </p><p> The arrows were carried in a quiver ( Genesis 27:3 ;  Isaiah 22:6 ;  49:2 ;  Psalms 127:5 ). They were apparently sometimes shot with some burning material attached to them ( Psalms 120:4 ).  </p><p> The bow is a symbol of victory ( Psalms 7:12 ). It denotes also falsehood, deceit ( Psalms 64:3 Psalms 64:4 ;  Hosea 7:16 ;  Jeremiah 9:3 ).  </p><p> "The use of the bow" in  2 Samuel 1:18  (A.V.) ought to be "the song of the bow," as in the Revised Version.  </p>
Bowels	<p>(Phil  1:8 ;  2:1 ;  Colossians 3:12 ), compassionate feelings; RSV, "tender mercies."  </p>
Bowing	<p>a mode of showing respect. Abraham "bowed himself to the people of the land" ( Genesis 23:7 ); so Jacob to Esau ( Genesis 33:3 ); and the brethren of Joseph before him as the governor of the land ( Genesis 43:28 ). Bowing is also frequently mentioned as an act of adoration to idols ( Joshua 23:7 ;  2 Kings  5:18 ;  Judges 2:19 ;  Isaiah 44:15 ), and to God ( Joshua 5:14 ;  Psalms 22:29 ;  72:9 ;  Micah 6:6 ;  Psalms 95:6 ;  Ephesians 3:14 ).  </p>
Bowl	<p>The sockets of the lamps of the golden candlestick of the tabernacle are called bowls ( Exodus 25:31 Exodus 25:33 Exodus 25:34 ;  Exodus 37:17 Exodus 37:19 Exodus 37:20 ); the same word so rendered being elsewhere rendered "cup" ( Genesis 44:2 Genesis 44:12 Genesis 44:16 ), and wine "pot" ( Jeremiah 35:5 ). The reservoir for oil, from which pipes led to each lamp in Zechariah's vision of the candlestick, is called also by this name ( Zechariah 4:2 Zechariah 4:3 ); so also are the vessels used for libations ( Exodus 25:29 ;  37:16 ).  </p>
Box	<p>for holding oil or perfumery ( Mark 14:3 ). It was of the form of a flask or bottle. The Hebrew word (pak) used for it is more appropriately rendered "vial" in  1 Samuel 10:1 , and should also be so rendered in  2 Kings 9:1 , where alone else it occurs.  </p>
Box-tree	<p>(Heb. teashshur), mentioned in  Isaiah 60:13 ;  41:19 , was, according to some, a species of cedar growing in Lebanon. The words of  Ezekiel 27:6  literally translated are, "Thy benches they have made of ivory, the daughter of the ashur tree," i.e., inlaid with ashur wood. The ashur is the box-tree, and accordingly the Revised Version rightly reads "inlaid in box wood." This is the Buxus sempervirens of botanists. It is remarkable for the beauty of its evergreen foliage and for the utility of its hard and durable wood.  </p>
Bozrah	<p>enclosure; fortress. </p><li> The city of Jobab, one of the early Edomite kings ( Genesis 36:33 ). This place is mentioned by the prophets in later times ( Isaiah 34:6 ;  Jeremiah 49:13 ;  Amos 1:12 ;  Micah 2:12 ). Its modern representative is el-Busseireh. It lies in the mountain district of Petra, 20 miles to the south-east of the Dead Sea.  </li><li> A Moabite city in the "plain country" ( Jeremiah 48:24 ), i.e., on the high level down on the east of the Dead Sea. It is probably the modern Buzrah.   </li>
Bracelet	<p></p><li> Anklets ( Numbers 31:50 ;  2 Sam  1:10 ), and with reference to men.  </li><li> The rendering of a Hebrew word meaning fasteners, found in  Genesis 24:22 Genesis 24:30 Genesis 24:47 .  </li><li> In  Isaiah 3:19 , the rendering of a Hebrew word meaning chains, i.e., twisted or chain-like bracelets.  </li><li> In  Exodus 35:22  it designates properly a clasp for fastening the dress of females. Some interpret it as a nose-ring.  </li><li> In  Genesis 38:18 Genesis 38:25 , the rendering of a Hebrew word meaning "thread," and may denote the ornamental cord with which the signet was suspended from the neck of the wearer.  <p> Bracelets were worn by men as well as by women (Cant  5:14 , RSV). They were of many various forms. The weight of those presented by Eliezer to Rebekah was ten shekels ( Genesis 24:22 ).  </p> </li>
Bramble	<p></p><li> Hebrew <i> atad</i> ,  Judges 9:14 ; rendered "thorn,"  Psalms 58:9 . The LXX. and Vulgate render by rhamnus, a thorny shrub common in Palestine, resembling the hawthorn.  </li><li> Hebrew <i> hoah</i> ,  Isaiah 34:13  (RSV "thistles"); "thickets" in  1 Samuel 13:6 ; "thistles" in 2Kings  2 Kings 25:18 ,  Job 31:40 ; "thorns" in  2 Chronicles 33:11 , Cant  2:2 ,  Hosea 9:6 . The word may be regarded as denoting the common thistle, of which there are many species which encumber the corn-fields of Palestine. (See THORNS .)  </li>
Branch	<p>a symbol of kings descended from royal ancestors ( Ezekiel 17:3 Ezekiel 17:10 ;  Daniel 11:7 ); of prosperity ( Job 8:16 ); of the Messiah, a branch out of the root of the stem of Jesse ( Isaiah 11:1 ), the "beautiful branch" ( 4:2 ), a "righteous branch" ( Jeremiah 23:5 ), "the Branch" ( Zechariah 3:8 ;  6:12 ).  </p><p> Disciples are branches of the true vine ( John 15:5 John 15:6 ). "The branch of the terrible ones" ( Isaiah 25:5 ) is rightly translated in the Revised Version "the song of the terrible ones," i.e., the song of victory shall be brought low by the destruction of Babylon and the return of the Jews from captivity.  </p><p> The "abominable branch" is a tree on which a malefactor has been hanged ( Isaiah 14:19 ). The "highest branch" in  Ezekiel 17:3  represents Jehoiakim the king.  </p>
Brass	<p>which is an alloy of copper and zinc, was not known till the thirteenth century. What is designated by this word in Scripture is properly copper ( Deuteronomy 8:9 ). It was used for fetters (Judg.  16:21 ;  2 Kings  25:7 ), for pieces of armour ( 1 Samuel 17:5 1 Samuel 17:6 ), for musical instruments ( 1 Chronicles 15:19 ;  1 Corinthians 13:1 ), and for money ( Matthew 10:9 ).  </p><p> It is a symbol of insensibility and obstinacy in sin ( Isaiah 48:4 ;  Jeremiah 6:28 ;  Ezekiel 22:18 ), and of strength ( Psalms 107:16 ;  Micah 4:13 ).  </p><p> The Macedonian empire is described as a kingdom of brass ( Daniel 2:39 ). The "mountains of brass" ( Zechariah 6:1 ) speaks of have been supposed to represent the immutable decrees of God.  </p><p> The serpent of brass was made by Moses at the command of God ( Numbers 21:4-9 ), and elevated on a pole, so that it might be seen by all the people when wounded by the bite of the serpents that were sent to them as a punishment for their murmurings against God and against Moses. It was afterwards carried by the Jews into Canaan, and preserved by them till the time of Hezekiah, who caused it to be at length destroyed because it began to be viewed by the people with superstitious reverence ( 2 Kings 18:4 ). (See NEHUSHTAN .) </p><p> The brazen serpent is alluded to by our Lord in  John 3:14 John 3:15 . (See SERPENT .) </p>
Bravery	<p>( Isaiah 3:18 ), an old English word meaning comeliness or beauty.  </p>
Breach	<p>an opening in a wall ( 1 Kings 11:27 ;  2 Kings  12:5 ); the fracture of a limb ( Leviticus 24:20 ), and hence the expression, "Heal, etc." ( Psalms 60:2 ).  Judges 5:17 , a bay or harbour; RSV, "by his creeks."  </p>
Bread	<p>among the Jews was generally made of wheat ( Exodus 29:2 ; Judg.  6:19 ), though also sometimes of other grains ( Genesis 14:18 ; Judg.  7:13 ). Parched grain was sometimes used for food without any other preparation ( Ruth 2:14 ).  </p><p> Bread was prepared by kneading in wooden bowls or "kneading troughs" ( Genesis 18:6 ;  Exodus 12:34 ;  Jeremiah 7:18 ). The dough was mixed with leaven and made into thin cakes, round or oval, and then baked. The bread eaten at the Passover was always unleavened ( Exodus 12:15-20 ;  Deuteronomy 16:3 ). In the towns there were public ovens, which were much made use of for baking bread; there were also bakers by trade ( Hosea 7:4 ;  Jeremiah 37:21 ). Their ovens were not unlike those of modern times. But sometimes the bread was baked by being placed on the ground that had been heated by a fire, and by covering it with the embers ( 1 Kings 19:6 ). This was probably the mode in which Sarah prepared bread on the occasion referred to in  Genesis 18:6 .  </p><p> In  Leviticus 2  there is an account of the different kinds of bread and cakes used by the Jews. (See BAKE .) </p><p> The shew-bread (q.v.) consisted of twelve loaves of unleavened bread prepared and presented hot on the golden table every Sabbath. They were square or oblong, and represented the twelve tribes of Israel. The old loaves were removed every Sabbath, and were to be eaten only by the priests in the court of the sanctuary ( Exodus 25:30 ;  Leviticus 24:8 ;  1 Samuel 21:1-6 ;  Matthew 12:4 ).  </p><p> The word bread is used figuratively in such expressions as "bread of sorrows" ( Psalms 127:2 ), "bread of tears" ( 80:5 ), i.e., sorrow and tears are like one's daily bread, they form so great a part in life. The bread of "wickedness" ( Proverbs 4:17 ) and "of deceit" ( 20:17 ) denote in like manner that wickedness and deceit are a part of the daily life.  </p>
Breastplate	<p></p><li> That piece of ancient armour that protected the breast. This word is used figuratively in  Ephesians 6:14  and  Isaiah 59:17 . (See ARMOUR .) </li><li> An ornament covering the breast of the high priest, first mentioned in  Exodus 25:7 . It was made of embroidered cloth, set with four rows of precious stones, three in each row. On each stone was engraved the name of one of the twelve tribes ( Exodus 28:15-29 ;  39:8-21 ). It was in size about ten inches square. The two upper corners were fastened to the ephod by blue ribbons. It was not to be "loosed from the ephod" ( Exodus 28:28 ). The lower corners were fastened to the girdle of the priest. As it reminded the priest of his representative character, it was called the memorial ( 28:29 ). It was also called the breastplate of judgment ( 28:15 ). (See PRIEST .)  </li>
Breeches	<p>( Exodus 28:42 ), rather linen drawers, reaching from the waist to a little above the knee, worn by the priests ( Ezekiel 44:17 Ezekiel 44:18 ).  </p>
Bribe	<p>None to be taken; "for the gift maketh open eyes blind, and perverteth the cause of the righteous" ( Exodus 23:8 , literally rendered).  </p>
Bricks	<p>the making of, formed the chief labour of the Israelites in Egypt ( Exodus 1:13 Exodus 1:14 ). Those found among the ruins of Babylon and Nineveh are about a foot square and four inches thick. They were usually dried in the sun, though also sometimes in kilns ( 2 Samuel 12:31 ;  Jeremiah 43:9 ;  Nahum 3:14 ). (See NEBUCHADNEZZAR .) </p><p> The bricks used in the tower of Babel were burnt bricks, cemented in the building by bitumen ( Genesis 11:3 ).  </p>
Bride	<p>frequently used in the ordinary sense ( Isaiah 49:18 ;  61:10 , etc.). The relation between Christ and his church is set forth under the figure of that between a bridegroom and bride ( John 3:29 ). The church is called "the bride" ( Revelation 21:9 ;  22:17 ). Compare parable of the Ten Virgins ( Matthew 25:1-13 ).  </p>
Bridle	<p>Three Hebrew words are thus rendered in the Authorized Version. </p><li> Heb. <i> mahsom'</i> signifies a muzzle or halter or bridle, by which the rider governs his horse (Ps.39:1).  </li><li> <i> Me'theg</i> , rendered also "bit" in  Psalms 32:9 , which is its proper meaning. Found in  2 Kings 19:28 , where the restraints of God's providence are metaphorically styled his "bridle" and "hook." God's placing a "bridle in the jaws of the people" ( Isaiah 30:28 ;  37:29 ) signifies his preventing the Assyrians from carrying out their purpose against Jerusalem.  </li><li> Another word, <i> re'sen</i> , was employed to represent a halter or bridle-rein, as used  Psalms 32:9 ;  Isaiah 30:28 . In  Job 30:11  the restraints of law and humanity are called a bridle.   </li>
Brier	<p>This word occurs frequently, and is the translation of several different terms. </p><li> Micah 7:4 , it denotes a species of thorn shrub used for hedges. In  Proverbs 15:19  the word is rendered "thorn" (Heb. <i> hedek</i> , "stinging"), supposed by some to be what is called the "apple of Sodom" (q.v.). </li><li> Ezekiel 28:24 , <i> sallon'</i> , properly a "prickle," such as is found on the shoots of the palm tree. </li><li> Isaiah 55:13 , probably simply a thorny bush. Some, following the Vulgate Version, regard it as the "nettle."  </li><li> Isaiah 5:6 ;  7:23-25 , etc., frequently used to denote thorny shrubs in general. In  10:17 ;  27:4 , it means troublesome men.  </li><li> In  Hebrews 6:8  the Greek word (tribolos) so rendered means "three-pronged," and denotes the land caltrop, a low throny shrub resembling in its spikes the military "crow-foot." Compare  Matthew 7:16 , "thistle."   </li>
Brigandine	<p>( Jeremiah 46:4 ;  51:3 ), an obsolete English word denoting a scale coat of armour, or habergeon, worn by light-armed "brigands." The Revised Version has "coat of mail."  </p>
Brimstone	<p>an inflammable mineral substance found in quantities on the shores of the Dead Sea. The cities of the plain were destroyed by a rain of fire and brimstone ( Genesis 19:24 Genesis 19:25 ). In  Isaiah 34:9  allusion is made to the destruction of these cities. This word figuratively denotes destruction or punishment ( Job 18:15 ;  Isaiah 30:33 ;  34:9 ;  Psalms 11:6 ;  Ezekiel 38:22 ). It is used to express the idea of excruciating torment in  Revelation 14:10 ;  19:20 ;  20:10 .  </p>
Brook	<p>a torrent. </p><li> Applied to small streams, as the Arnon, Jabbok, etc. ( Isaiah 15:7 ) speaks of the "book of the willows," probably the Wady-el-Asha. </li><li> It is also applied to winter torrents ( Job 6:15 ;  Numbers 34:5 ;  Joshua 15:4 Joshua 15:47 ), and to the torrent-bed or wady as well as to the torrent itself ( Numbers 13:23 ;  1 Kings 17:3 ). </li><li> In  Isaiah 19:7  the river Nile is meant, as rendered in the Revised Version.   </li>
Brother	<p></p><li> In the natural and common sense ( Matthew 1:2 ;  Luke 3:1 Luke 3:19 ).  </li><li> A near relation, a cousin ( Genesis 13:8 ;  14:16 ;  Matthew 12:46 ;  John 7:3 ;  Acts 1:14 ;  Galatians 1:19 ).  </li><li> Simply a fellow-countryman ( Matthew 5:47 ;  Acts 3:22 ;  Hebrews 7:5 ).  </li><li> A disciple or follower ( Matthew 25:40 ;  Hebrews 2:11 Hebrews 2:12 ).  </li><li> One of the same faith ( Amos 1:9 ;  Acts 9:30 ;  11:29 ;  1 Corinthians 5:11 ); whence the early disciples of our Lord were known to each other as brethren.  </li><li> A colleague in office ( Ezra 3:2 ;  1 Corinthians 1:1 ;  2 co  1:1 ).  </li><li> A fellow-man ( Genesis 9:5 ;  19:7 ;  Matthew 5:22 Matthew 5:23 Matthew 5:24 ;  7:5 ;  Hebrews 2:17 ).  </li><li> One beloved or closely united with another in affection ( 2 Samuel 1:26 ;  Acts 6:3 ;  1 Thessalonians 5:1 ). Brethren of Jesus ( Matthew 1:25 ;  Matthew 12:46 Matthew 12:50 :  Mark 3:31 Mark 3:32 ;  Galatians 1:19 ;  1 Corinthians 9:5 , etc.) were probably the younger children of Joseph and Mary. Some have supposed that they may have been the children of Joseph by a former marriage, and others that they were the children of Mary, the Virgin's sister, and wife of Cleophas. The first interpretation, however, is the most natural.   </li>
Bruit	<p>a rumour or report ( Jeremiah 10:22 , RSV "rumour;"  Nahum 3:19 ).  </p>
Bucket	<p>a vessel to draw water with ( Isaiah 40:15 ); used figuratively, probably, of a numerous issue ( Numbers 24:7 ).  </p>
Buckler	<p></p><li> A portable shield ( 2 Samuel 22:31 ;  1 Chronicles 5:18 ).  </li><li> A shield surrounding the person; the targe or round form; used once figuratively ( Psalms 91:4 ).  </li><li> A large shield protecting the whole body ( Psalms 35:2 ; Ezek.  23:24 ;  26:8 ).  </li><li> A lance or spear; improperly rendered "buckler" in the Authorized Version ( 1 Chronicles 12:8 ), but correctly in the Revised Version "spear."  <p> The leather of shields required oiling ( 2 Samuel 1:21 ;  Isaiah 21:5 ), so as to prevent its being injured by moisture. Copper (= "brass") shields were also in use ( 1 Samuel 17:6 ;  1 Kings 14:27 ). Those spoken of in  1 Kings 10:16 , etc.;  14:26 , were probably of massive metal.  </p><p> The shields David had taken from his enemies were suspended in the temple as mementoes ( 2 Kings 11:10 ). (See ARMOUR,  SHIELD .) </p> </li>
Building	<p>among the Jews was suited to the climate and conditions of the country. They probably adopted the kind of architecture for their dwellings which they found already existing when they entered Canaan ( Deuteronomy 6:10 ;  Numbers 13:19 ). Phoenician artists ( 2 Samuel 5:11 ;  1 Kings 5:6 1 Kings 5:18 ) assisted at the erection of the royal palace and the temple at Jerusalem. Foreigners also assisted at the restoration of the temple after the Exile ( Ezra 3:7 ).  </p><p> In  Genesis 11:3 Genesis 11:9 , we have the first recorded instance of the erection of buildings. The cities of the plain of Shinar were founded by the descendants of Shem ( Genesis 10:11 Genesis 10:12 Genesis 10:22 ).  </p><p> The Israelites were by occupation shepherds and dwellers in tents ( Genesis 47:3 ); but from the time of their entering Canaan they became dwellers in towns, and in houses built of the native limestone of Palestine. Much building was carried on in Solomon's time. Besides the buildings he completed at Jerusalem, he also built Baalath and Tadmor ( 1 Kings 9:15 1 Kings 9:24 ). Many of the kings of Israel and Judah were engaged in erecting various buildings.  </p><p> Herod and his sons and successors restored the temple, and built fortifications and other structures of great magnificence in Jerusalem ( Luke 21:5 ).  </p><p> The instruments used in building are mentioned as the plumb-line ( Amos 7:7 ), the measuring-reed ( Ezekiel 40:3 ), and the saw ( 1 Kings 7:9 ).  </p><p> Believers are "God's building" ( 1 Corinthians 3:9 ); and heaven is called "a building of God" ( 2 Corinthians 5:1 ). Christ is the only foundation of his church ( 1 Corinthians 3:10-12 ), of which he also is the builder ( Matthew 16:18 ).  </p>
Bul	<p>rainy, the eighth ecclesiastical month of the year ( 1 Kings 6:38 ), and the second month of the civil year; later called Marchesvan (q.v.). (See MONTH .) </p>
Bullock	<p></p><li> The translation of a word which is a generic name for horned cattle ( Isaiah 65:25 ). It is also rendered "cow" (Ezek.  4:15 ), "ox" ( Genesis 12:16 ).  </li><li> The translation of a word always meaning an animal of the ox kind, without distinction of age or sex ( Hosea 12:11 ). It is rendered "cow" ( Numbers 18:17 ) and "ox" ( Leviticus 17:3 ).  </li><li> Another word is rendered in the same way ( Jeremiah 31:18 ). It is also translated "calf" ( Leviticus 9:3 ;  Micah 6:6 ). It is the same word used of the "molten calf" ( Exodus 32:4 Exodus 32:8 ) and "the golden calf" ( 1 Kings 12:28 ).  </li><li> In  Judges 6:25 ;  Isaiah 34:7 , the Hebrew word is different. It is the customary word for bulls offered in sacrifice. In  Hosea 14:2 , the Authorized Version has "calves," the Revised Version "bullocks."   </li>
Bulrush	<p></p><li> In  Isaiah 58:5  the rendering of a word which denotes "belonging to a marsh," from the nature of the soil in which it grows ( Isaiah 18:2 ). It was sometimes platted into ropes ( Job 41:2 ; A.V., "hook," RSV, "rope," lit. "cord of rushes").  </li><li> In  Exodus 2:3 ,  Isaiah 18:2  (RSV, "papyrus") this word is the translation of the Hebrew <i> gome</i> , which designates the plant as absorbing moisture. In  Isaiah 35:7  and  Job 8:11  it is rendered "rush." This was the Egyptian papyrus (papyrus Nilotica). It was anciently very abundant in Egypt. The Egyptians made garments and shoes and various utensils of it. It was used for the construction of the ark of Moses ( Exodus 2:3 Exodus 2:5 ). The root portions of the stem were used for food. The inside bark was cut into strips, which were sewed together and dried in the sun, forming the papyrus used for writing. It is no longer found in Egypt, but grows luxuriantly in Palestine, in the marshes of the Huleh, and in the swamps at the north end of the Lake of Gennesaret. (See CANE .)  </li>
Bulwarks	<p>mural towers, bastions, were introduced by king Uzziah ( 2 Chronicles 26:15 ;  Zephaniah 1:16 ;  Psalms 48:13 ;  Isaiah 26:1 ). There are five Hebrew words so rendered in the Authorized Version, but the same word is also variously rendered.  </p>
Bunch	<p></p><li> A bundle of twigs ( Exodus 12:22 ). </li><li> Bunch or cake of raisins ( 2 Samuel 16:1 ). </li><li> The "bunch of a camel" ( Isaiah 30:6 ).   </li>
Burden	<p></p><li> A load of any kind ( Exodus 23:5 ). </li><li> A severe task ( Exodus 2:11 ). </li><li> A difficult duty, requiring effort ( Exodus 18:22 ). </li><li> A prophecy of a calamitous or disastrous nature ( Isaiah 13:1 ;  17:1 ;  Habakkuk 1:1 , etc.).   </li>
Burial	<p>The first burial we have an account of is that of Sarah ( Genesis 23 ). The first commercial transaction recorded is that of the purchase of a burial-place, for which Abraham weighed to Ephron "four hundred shekels of silver current money with the merchants." Thus the patriarch became the owner of a part of the land of Canaan, the only part he ever possessed. When he himself died, "his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah," beside Sarah his wife ( Genesis 25:9 ).  </p><p> Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, was buried under Allon-bachuth, "the oak of weeping" ( Genesis 35:8 ), near to Bethel. Rachel died, and was buried near Ephrath; "and Jacob set a pillar upon her grave" (16-20). Isaac was buried at Hebron, where he had died (27,29). Jacob, when charging his sons to bury him in the cave of Machpelah, said, "There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah" ( 49:31 ). In compliance with the oath which he made him swear unto him ( 47:29-31 ), Joseph, assisted by his brethren, buried Jacob in the cave of Machpelah ( Genesis 50:2 Genesis 50:13 ). At the Exodus, Moses "took the bones of Joseph with him," and they were buried in the "parcel of ground" which Jacob had bought of the sons of Hamor ( Joshua 24:32 ), which became Joseph's inheritance ( Genesis 48:22 ;  1 Chronicles 5:1 ;  John 4:5 ). Two burials are mentioned as having taken place in the wilderness. That of Miriam ( Numbers 20:1 ), and that of Moses, "in the land of Moab" ( Deuteronomy 34:5 Deuteronomy 34:6 Deuteronomy 34:8 ). There is no account of the actual burial of Aaron, which probably, however, took place on the summit of Mount Hor ( Numbers 20:28 Numbers 20:29 ).  </p><p> Joshua was buried "in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah" ( Joshua 24: :  <span class="badLink">30</span> ).  </p><p> In Job we find a reference to burying-places, which were probably the Pyramids ( Joshua 3:14 Joshua 3:15 ). The Hebrew word for "waste places" here resembles in sound the Egyptian word for "pyramids."  </p><p> Samuel, like Moses, was honoured with a national burial ( 1 Samuel 25:1 ). Joab ( 1 Kings 2:34 ) "was buried in his own house in the wilderness."  </p><p> In connection with the burial of Saul and his three sons we meet for the first time with the practice of burning the dead ( 1 Samuel 31:11-13 ). The same practice is again referred to by ( Amos 6:10 ).  </p><p> Absalom was buried "in the wood" where he was slain ( 2 Samuel 18:17 2 Samuel 18:18 ). The raising of the heap of stones over his grave was intended to mark abhorrence of the person buried (Compare  Joshua 7:26  and  8:29 ). There was no fixed royal burying-place for the Hebrew kings. We find several royal burials taking place, however, "in the city of David" ( 1 Kings 2:10 ;  11:43 ;  15:8 ;  2 Kings  1 Kings 14:19 1 Kings 14:20 ;  <span class="badLink">15:38</span> ;  1 Kings 14:31 ;  22:50 ;  2 Chr  1 Kings 21:19 1 Kings 21:20 ;  2 Chr  <span class="badLink">24:25</span> , etc.). Hezekiah was buried in the mount of the sepulchres of the sons of David; "and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death" ( 2 Chronicles 32:33 ).  </p><p> Little is said regarding the burial of the kings of Israel. Some of them were buried in Samaria, the capital of their kingdom ( 2 Kings 10:35 ;  13:9 ;  14:16 ).  </p><p> Our Lord was buried in a new tomb, hewn out of the rock, which Joseph of Arimathea had prepared for himself ( Matthew 27:57-60 ;  Mark 15:46 ;  John 19:41 John 19:42 ).  </p><p> The grave of Lazarus was "a cave, and a stone lay on it" ( John 11:38 ). Graves were frequently either natural caverns or artificial excavations formed in the sides of rocks ( Genesis 23:9 ;  Matthew 27:60 ); and coffins were seldom used, unless when the body was brought from a distance.  </p>
Burnt offering	<p>Hebrew <i> olah</i> ; i.e., "ascending," the whole being consumed by fire, and regarded as ascending to God while being consumed. Part of every offering was burnt in the sacred fire, but this was wholly burnt, a "whole burnt offering." It was the most frequent form of sacrifice, and apparently the only one mentioned in the book of Genesis. Such were the sacrifices offered by Abel ( Genesis 4:3 Genesis 4:4 , here called <i> minhah</i> ; i.e., "a gift"), Noah ( Genesis 8:20 ), Abraham ( Genesis 22:2 Genesis 22:7 Genesis 22:8 Genesis 22:13 ), and by the Hebrews in Egypt ( Exodus 10:25 ).  </p><p> The law of Moses afterwards prescribed the occasions and the manner in which burnt sacrifices were to be offered. There were "the continual burnt offering" ( Exodus 29:38-42 ;  Leviticus 6:9-13 ), "the burnt offering of every sabbath," which was double the daily one ( Numbers 28:9 Numbers 28:10 ), "the burnt offering of every month" ( 28:11-15 ), the offerings at the Passover (19-23), at Pentecost ( Leviticus 23:16 ), the feast of Trumpets ( 23:23-25 ), and on the day of Atonement ( Leviticus 16 ).  </p><p> On other occasions special sacrifices were offered, as at the consecration of Aaron ( Exodus 29 ) and the dedication of the temple ( 1 Kings 8:5 1 Kings 8:62-64 ).  </p><p> Free-will burnt offerings were also permitted ( Leviticus 1:13 ), and were offered at the accession of Solomon to the throne ( 1 Chronicles 29:21 ), and at the reformation brought about by Hezekiah ( 2 Chronicles 29: :  <span class="badLink">3135</span> -35).  </p><p> These offerings signified the complete dedication of the offerers unto God. This is referred to in  Romans 12:1 . (See ALTAR,  SACRIFICE .) </p>
Bush	<p>in which Jehovah appeared to Moses in the wilderness ( Exodus 3:2 ;  Acts 7:30 ). It is difficult to say what particular kind of plant or bush is here meant. Probably it was the mimosa or acacia. The words "in the bush" in  Mark 12:26 ;  Luke 20:37 , mean "in the passage or paragraph on the bush;" i.e., in  Exodus 3 .  </p>
Butler	<p>properly a servant in charge of the wine ( Genesis 40:1-13 ;  41:9 ). The Hebrew word, <i> mashkeh</i> , thus translated is rendered also (plural) "cup-bearers" ( 1 Kings 10:5 ;  2 Chr  9:4 ). ( Nehemiah 1:11 ) was cup-bearer to king Artaxerxes. It was a position of great responsibility and honour in royal households.  </p>
Butter	<p>(Heb. hemah), curdled milk ( Genesis 18:8 ;  Judges 5:25 ;  2 Sam.  <span class="badLink">17:29</span> ), or butter in the form of the skim of hot milk or cream, called by the Arabs kaimak, a semi-fluid ( Job 20:17 ;  29:6 ;  Deuteronomy 32:14 ). The words of  Proverbs 30:33  have been rendered by some "the pressure [not churning] of milk bringeth forth cheese."  </p>
Buz	<p>contempt. </p><li> The second son of Nahor and Milcah, and brother of Huz ( Genesis 22:21 ). Elihu was one of his descendants ( Job 32:2 ).  </li><li> One of the chiefs of the tribe of Gad ( 1 Chronicles 5:14 ).  </li><li> A district in Arabia Petrea ( Jeremiah 25:23 ).   </li>
Buzi	<p>the father of the prophet ( Ezekiel 1:3 ).  </p>
By	<p>in the expression "by myself" (A.V.,  1 Corinthians 4:4 ), means, as rendered in the Revised Version, "against myself."  </p>
By and by	<p>immediately ( Matthew 13:21 ; RSV, "straightway;"  Luke 21:9 ).  </p>
By-ways	<p>only in  Judges 5:6  and  Psalms 125:5 ; literally "winding or twisted roads." The margin has "crooked ways."  </p>
By-word	<p>Hebrew <i> millah</i> ( Job 30:9 ), a word or speech, and hence object of talk; Hebrew <i> mashal</i> ( Psalms 44:14 ), a proverb or parable. When it denotes a sharp word of derision, as in De 28:37,1Kings  Deuteronomy 7:20 , the Hebrew <i> sheninah</i> is used. In  Jeremiah 24:9  it is rendered "taunt."  </p>
Chosen	<p>spoken of warriors ( Exodus 15:4 ;  Judges 20:16 ), of the Hebrew nation ( Psalms 105:43 ;  Deuteronomy 7:7 ), of Jerusalem as the seat of the temple ( 1 Kings 11:13 ). Christ is the "chosen" of God ( Isaiah 42:1 ); and the apostles are "chosen" for their work ( Acts 10:41 ). It is said with regard to those who do not profit by their opportunities that "many are called, but few are chosen" ( Matthew 20:16 ). (See ELECTION .) </p>
Chozeba	<p>( 1 Chronicles 4:22 ), the same as Chezib and Achzib, a place in the lowlands of Judah ( Genesis 38:5 ;  Joshua 15:44 ).  </p>
Christ	<p>anointed, the Greek translation of the Hebrew word rendered "Messiah" (q.v.), the official title of our Lord, occurring five hundred and fourteen times in the New Testament. It denotes that he was anointed or consecrated to his great redemptive work as Prophet, Priest, and King of his people. He is Jesus the Christ ( Acts 17:3 ;  18:5 ;  Matthew 22:42 ), the Anointed One. He is thus spoken of by ( Isaiah 61:1 ), and by ( Daniel 9:24-26 ), who styles him "Messiah the Prince."  </p><p> The Messiah is the same person as "the seed of the woman" ( Genesis 3:15 ), "the seed of Abraham" ( Genesis 22:18 ), the "Prophet like unto Moses" ( Deuteronomy 18:15 ), "the priest after the order of Melchizedek" ( Psalms 110:4 ), "the rod out of the stem of Jesse" ( Isaiah 11:1 Isaiah 11:10 ), the "Immanuel," the virgin's son ( Isaiah 7:14 ), "the branch of Jehovah" ( Isaiah 4:2 ), and "the messenger of the covenant" ( Malachi 3:1 ). This is he "of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write." The Old Testament Scripture is full of prophetic declarations regarding the Great Deliverer and the work he was to accomplish. Jesus the Christ is Jesus the Great Deliverer, the Anointed One, the Saviour of men. This name denotes that Jesus was divinely appointed, commissioned, and accredited as the Saviour of men ( Hebrews 5:4 ;  Isaiah 11:2-4 ;  49:6 ;  John 5:37 ;  Acts 2:22 ).  </p><p> To believe that "Jesus is the Christ" is to believe that he is the Anointed, the Messiah of the prophets, the Saviour sent of God, that he was, in a word, what he claimed to be. This is to believe the gospel, by the faith of which alone men can be brought unto God. That Jesus is the Christ is the testimony of God, and the faith of this constitutes a Christian ( 1 Corinthians 12:3 ;  1 John 5:1 ).  </p>
Christian	<p>the name given by the Greeks or Romans, probably in reproach, to the followers of Jesus. It was first used at Antioch. The names by which the disciples were known among themselves were "brethren," "the faithful," "elect," "saints," "believers." But as distinguishing them from the multitude without, the name "Christian" came into use, and was universally accepted. This name occurs but three times in the New Testament ( Acts 11:26 ;  26:28 ;  1 Peter 4:16 ).  </p>
Christs, False	<p>Our Lord warned his disciples that they would arise ( Matthew 24:24 ). It is said that no fewer than twenty-four persons have at different times appeared (the last in 1682) pretending to be the Messiah of the prophets.  </p>
Chronicles	<p>the words of the days, ( 1 Kings 14:19 ;  1 Chronicles 27:24 ), the daily or yearly records of the transactions of the kingdom; events recorded in the order of time.  </p>
Chronicles of king David	<p>( 1 Chronicles 27:24 ) were statistical state records; one of the public sources from which the compiler of the Books of Chronicles derived information on various public matters.  </p>
Chronicles, Books of	<p>The two books were originally one. They bore the title in the Massoretic Hebrew <i> Dibre hayyamim</i> , i.e., "Acts of the Days." This title was rendered by Jerome in his Latin version "Chronicon," and hence "Chronicles." In the Septuagint version the book is divided into two, and bears the title Paraleipomena, i.e., "things omitted," or "supplements", because containing many things omitted in the Books of Kings. </p><p> The contents of these books are comprehended under four heads. </p><li> The first nine chapters of Book I. contain little more than a list of genealogies in the line of Israel down to the time of David. </li><li> The remainder of the first book contains a history of the reign of David. </li><li> The first nine chapters of Book II. contain the history of the reign of Solomon. </li><li> The remaining chapters of the second book contain the history of the separate kingdom of Judah to the time of the return from Babylonian Exile.  <p> The time of the composition of the Chronicles was, there is every ground to conclude, subsequent to the Babylonian Exile, probably between 450 and 435 B.C. The contents of this twofold book, both as to matter and form, correspond closely with this idea. The close of the book records the proclamation of Cyrus permitting the Jews to return to their own land, and this forms the opening passage of the Book of Ezra, which must be viewed as a continuation of the Chronicles. The peculiar form of the language, being Aramaean in its general character, harmonizes also with that of the books which were written after the Exile. The author was certainly contemporary with Zerubbabel, details of whose family history are given ( 1 Chronicles 3:19 ).  </p><p> The time of the composition being determined, the question of the authorship may be more easily decided. According to Jewish tradition, which was universally received down to the middle of the seventeenth century, Ezra was regarded as the author of the Chronicles. There are many points of resemblance and of contact between the Chronicles and the Book of Ezra which seem to confirm this opinion. The conclusion of the one and the beginning of the other are almost identical in expression. In their spirit and characteristics they are the same, showing thus also an identity of authorship. </p><p> In their general scope and design these books are not so much historical as didactic. The principal aim of the writer appears to be to present moral and religious truth. He does not give prominence to political occurences, as is done in Samuel and Kings, but to ecclesiastical institutions. "The genealogies, so uninteresting to most modern readers, were really an important part of the public records of the Hebrew state. They were the basis on which not only the land was distributed and held, but the public services of the temple were arranged and conducted, the Levites and their descendants alone, as is well known, being entitled and first fruits set apart for that purpose." The "Chronicles" are an epitome of the sacred history from the days of Adam down to the return from Babylonian Exile, a period of about 3,500 years. The writer gathers up "the threads of the old national life broken by the Captivity."  </p><p> The sources whence the chronicler compiled his work were public records, registers, and genealogical tables belonging to the Jews. These are referred to in the course of the book ( 1 Chronicles 27:24 ;  29:29 ;  2 Chr  9:29 ;  12:15 ;  <span class="badLink">13:22</span> ;  <span class="badLink">20:34</span> ;  24:27 ;  26:22 ;  <span class="badLink">32:32</span> ;  <span class="badLink">1 Chronicles 33:18</span> <span class="badLink">1 Chronicles 33:19</span> ;  27:7 ;  <span class="badLink">35:25</span> ). There are in Chronicles, and the books of Samuel and Kings, forty parallels, often verbal, proving that the writer both knew and used these records ( 1 Chronicles 17:18 ; Compare  2 Samuel 7:18-20 ;  1 Chronicles 19 ; Compare  2 Samuel 10 , etc.).  </p><p> As compared with Samuel and Kings, the Book of Chronicles omits many particulars there recorded ( 2 Samuel 6:20-23 ;  9 ;  11 ;  <span class="badLink">1419</span> -19, etc.), and includes many things peculiar to itself ( 1 Chronicles 12 ;  22 ;  <span class="badLink">2326</span> -26;  27 ;  28 ;  29 , etc.). Twenty whole chapters, and twenty-four parts of chapters, are occupied with matter not found elsewhere. It also records many things in fuller detail, as (e.g.) the list of David's heroes ( 1 Chronicles 12:1-37 ), the removal of the ark from Kirjath-jearim to Mount Zion ( 1 Chronicles 13 ;  15:2-24 ;  16:4-43 ; Compare  2 Samuel 6 ), Uzziah's leprosy and its cause ( 2 Chronicles 26:16-21 ; Compare  2 Kings 15:5 ), etc.  </p><p> It has also been observed that another peculiarity of the book is that it substitutes modern and more common expressions for those that had then become unusual or obsolete. This is seen particularly in the substitution of modern names of places, such as were in use in the writer's day, for the old names; thus Gezer ( 1 Chronicles 20:4 ) is used instead of Gob ( 2 Samuel 21:18 ), etc.  </p><p> The Books of Chronicles are ranked among the <i> khethubim</i> or hagiographa. They are alluded to, though not directly quoted, in the New Testament ( Hebrews 5:4 ;  Matthew 12:42 ;  23:35 ;  Luke 1:5 ;  Luke 11:31 Luke 11:51 ).  </p> </li>
Chronology	<p>is the arrangement of facts and events in the order of time. The writers of the Bible themselves do not adopt any standard era according to which they date events. Sometimes the years are reckoned, e.g., from the time of the Exodus ( Numbers 1:1 ;  33:38 ;  1 Kings 6:1 ), and sometimes from the accession of kings ( 1 Kings 15:1 1 Kings 15:9 1 Kings 15:25 1 Kings 15:33 , etc.), and sometimes again from the return from Exile ( Ezra 3:8 ).  </p><p> Hence in constructing a system of Biblecal chronology, the plan has been adopted of reckoning the years from the ages of the patriarchs before the birth of their first-born sons for the period from the Creation to Abraham. After this period other data are to be taken into account in determining the relative sequence of events. </p><p> As to the patriarchal period, there are three principal systems of chronology: (1) that of the Hebrew text, (2) that of the Septuagint version, and (3) that of the Samaritan Pentateuch, as seen in the scheme on the opposite page.  </p><p> The Samaritan and the Septuagint have considerably modified the Hebrew chronology. This modification some regard as having been wilfully made, and to be rejected. The same system of variations is observed in the chronology of the period between the Flood and Abraham. Thus: </p><p> |             Hebrew Septuigant Samaritan  | From the birth of  |  Arphaxad, 2 years  |  after the Flood, to  |  the birth of Terah.   220   1000    870  | From the birth of  |  Terah to the birth  |  of Abraham.       130    70     72  </p><p> The Septuagint fixes on seventy years as the age of Terah at the birth of Abraham, from  Genesis 11:26 ; but a comparison of  Genesis 11:32  and  Acts 7:4  with  Genesis 12:4  shows that when Terah died, at the age of two hundred and five years, Abraham was seventy-five years, and hence Terah must have been one hundred and thirty years when Abraham was born. Thus, including the two years from the Flood to the birth of Arphaxad, the period from the Flood to the birth of Abraham was three hundred and fifty-two years.  </p><p> The next period is from the birth of Abraham to the Exodus. This, according to the Hebrew, extends to five hundred and five years. The difficulty here is as to the four hundred and thirty years mentioned  Exodus 12:40 Exodus 12:41 ;  Galatians 3:17 . These years are regarded by some as dating from the covenant with Abraham ( Genesis 15 ), which was entered into soon after his sojourn in Egypt; others, with more probability, reckon these years from Jacob's going down into Egypt. (See EXODUS .) </p><p> In modern times the systems of Biblical chronology that have been adopted are chiefly those of Ussher and Hales. The former follows the Hebrew, and the latter the Septuagint mainly. Archbishop Ussher's (died 1656) system is called the short chronology. It is that given on the margin of the Authorized Version, but is really of no authority, and is quite uncertain.  </p><p> |             Ussher  Hales  |             B.C.   B.C.  | Creation         4004   5411  | Flood          2348   3155  | Abram leaves Haran    1921   2078  | Exodus          1491   1648  | Destruction of the  |  Temple         588   586  </p><p> To show at a glance the different ideas of the date of the creation, it may be interesting to note the following: From Creation to 1894.  </p><p> According to Ussher, 5,898; Hales, 7,305; Zunz (Hebrew reckoning), 5,882; Septuagint (Perowne), 7,305; Rabbinical, 5,654; Panodorus, 7,387; Anianus, 7,395; Constantinopolitan, 7,403; Eusebius, 7,093; Scaliger, 5,844; Dionysius (from whom we take our Christian era), 7,388; Maximus, 7,395; Syncellus and Theophanes, 7,395; Julius Africanus, 7,395; Jackson, 7,320.  </p>
Chrysoprasus	<p>golden leek, a precious stone of the colour of leek's juice, a greenish-golden colour ( Revelation 21:20 ).  </p>
Chub	<p>the name of a people in alliance with Egypt in the time of Nebuchadnezzar. The word is found only in  Ezekiel 30:5 . They were probably a people of Northern Africa, or of the lands near Egypt in the south.  </p>
Chun	<p>one of the cities of Hadarezer, king of Syria. David procured brass (i.e., bronze or copper) from it for the temple ( 1 Chronicles 18:8 ). It is called Berothai in  2 Samuel 8:8 ; probably the same as Berothah in  Ezekiel 47:16 .  </p>
Church	<p>Derived probably from the Greek kuriakon (i.e., "the Lord's house"), which was used by ancient authors for the place of worship. </p><p> In the New Testament it is the translation of the Greek word ecclesia, which is synonymous with the Hebrew <i> kahal</i> of the Old Testament, both words meaning simply an assembly, the character of which can only be known from the connection in which the word is found. There is no clear instance of its being used for a place of meeting or of worship, although in post-apostolic times it early received this meaning. Nor is this word ever used to denote the inhabitants of a country united in the same profession, as when we say the "Church of England," the "Church of Scotland," etc. </p><p> We find the word ecclesia used in the following senses in the New Testament: </p><li> It is translated "assembly" in the ordinary classical sense ( Acts 19:32 Acts 19:39 Acts 19:41 ).  </li><li> It denotes the whole body of the redeemed, all those whom the Father has given to Christ, the invisible catholic church ( Ephesians 5:23 Ephesians 5:25 Ephesians 5:27 Ephesians 5:29 ;  Hebrews 12:23 ).  </li><li> A few Christians associated together in observing the ordinances of the gospel are an ecclesia ( Romans 16:5 ;  Colossians 4:15 ).  </li><li> All the Christians in a particular city, whether they assembled together in one place or in several places for religious worship, were an ecclesia. Thus all the disciples in Antioch, forming several congregations, were one church ( Acts 13:1 ); so also we read of the "church of God at Corinth" ( 1 Corinthians 1:2 ), "the church at Jerusalem" ( Acts 8:1 ), "the church of Ephesus" ( Revelation 2:1 ), etc.  </li><li> The whole body of professing Christians throughout the world ( 1 Corinthians 15:9 ;  Galatians 1:13 ;  Matthew 16:18 ) are the church of Christ.  <p> The church visible "consists of all those throughout the world that profess the true religion, together with their children." It is called "visible" because its members are known and its assemblies are public. Here there is a mixture of "wheat and chaff," of saints and sinners. "God has commanded his people to organize themselves into distinct visible ecclesiastical communities, with constitutions, laws, and officers, badges, ordinances, and discipline, for the great purpose of giving visibility to his kingdom, of making known the gospel of that kingdom, and of gathering in all its elect subjects. Each one of these distinct organized communities which is faithful to the great King is an integral part of the visible church, and all together constitute the catholic or universal visible church." A credible profession of the true religion constitutes a person a member of this church. This is "the kingdom of heaven," whose character and progress are set forth in the parables recorded in  Matthew 13 .  </p><p> The children of all who thus profess the true religion are members of the visible church along with their parents. Children are included in every covenant God ever made with man. They go along with their parents ( Genesis 9:9-17 ;  12:1-3 ;  17:7 ;  Exodus 20:5 ;  Deuteronomy 29:10-13 ). Peter, on the day of Pentecost, at the beginning of the New Testament dispensation, announces the same great principle. "The promise [just as to Abraham and his seed the promises were made] is unto you, and to your children" ( Acts 2:38 Acts 2:39 ). The children of believing parents are "holy", i.e., are "saints", a title which designates the members of the Christian church ( 1 Corinthians 7:14 ). (See BAPTISM .) </p><p> The church invisible "consists of the whole number of the elect that have been, are, or shall be gathered into one under Christ, the head thereof." This is a pure society, the church in which Christ dwells. It is the body of Christ. it is called "invisible" because the greater part of those who constitute it are already in heaven or are yet unborn, and also because its members still on earth cannot certainly be distinguished. The qualifications of membership in it are internal and are hidden. It is unseen except by Him who "searches the heart." "The Lord knoweth them that are his" ( 2 Timothy 2:19 ).  </p><p> The church to which the attributes, prerogatives, and promises appertaining to Christ's kingdom belong, is a spiritual body consisting of all true believers, i.e., the church invisible. </p></li><li> Its unity. God has ever had only one church on earth. We sometimes speak of the Old Testament Church and of the New Testament church, but they are one and the same. The Old Testament church was not to be changed but enlarged ( Isaiah 49:13-23 ;  60:1-14 ). When the Jews are at length restored, they will not enter a new church, but will be grafted again into "their own olive tree" ( Romans 11:18-24 ; Compare  Ephesians 2:11-22 ). The apostles did not set up a new organization. Under their ministry disciples were "added" to the "church" already existing ( Acts 2:47 ).  </li><li> Its universality. It is the "catholic" church; not confined to any particular country or outward organization, but comprehending all believers throughout the whole world.  </li><li> Its perpetuity. It will continue through all ages to the end of the world. It can never be destroyed. It is an "everlasting kindgdom."   </li>
Churl	<p>in  Isaiah 32:5  (RSV marg., "crafty"), means a deceiver. In  1 Samuel 25:3 , the word churlish denotes a man that is coarse and ill-natured, or, as the word literally means, "hard." The same Greek word as used by the LXX. here is found in  Matthew 25:24 , and there is rendered "hard."  </p>
Chushan-rishathaim	<p>Cush of double wickedness, or governor of two presidencies, the king of Mesopotamia who oppressed Israel in the generation immediately following Joshua ( Judges 3:8 ). We learn from the Tell-el-Amarna tablets that Palestine had been invaded by the forces of Aram-naharaim (A.V., "Mesopotamia") more than once, long before the Exodus, and that at the time they were written the king of Aram-naharaim was still intriguing in Canaan. It is mentioned among the countries which took part in the attack upon Egypt in the reign of Rameses III. (of the Twentieth Dynasty), but as its king is not one of the princes stated to have been conquered by the Pharaoh, it would seem that he did not actually enter Egypt. As the reign of Rameses III. corresponds with the Israelitish occupation of Canaan, it is probable that the Egyptian monuments refer to the oppression of the Israelites by Chushan-rishathaim. Canaan was still regarded as a province of Egypt, so that, in attacking it Chushan-rishathaim would have been considered to be attacking Egypt.  </p>
Cilicia	<p>a maritime province in the south-east of Asia Minor. Tarsus, the birth-place of Paul, was one of its chief towns, and the seat of a celebrated school of philosophy. Its luxurious climate attracted to it many Greek residents after its incorporation with the Macedonian empire. It was formed into a Roman province, B.C. 67. The Jews of Cilicia had a synagogue at Jerusalem ( Acts 6:9 ). Paul visited it soon after his conversion ( Galatians 1:21 ;  Acts 9:30 ), and again, on his second missionary journey ( 15:41 ), "he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches." It was famous for its goat's-hair cloth, called cilicium. Paul learned in his youth the trade of making tents of this cloth.  </p>
Cinnamon	<p>Heb. kinamon, the Cinnamomum zeylanicum of botanists, a tree of the Laurel family, which grows only in India on the Malabar coast, in Ceylon, and China. There is no trace of it in Egypt, and it was unknown in Syria. The inner rind when dried and rolled into cylinders forms the cinnamon of commerce. The fruit and coarser pieces of bark when boiled yield a fragrant oil. It was one of the principal ingredients in the holy anointing oil ( Exodus 30:23 ). It is mentioned elsewhere only in  Proverbs 7:17 ; Cant.  4:14 ;  Revelation 18:13 . The mention of it indicates a very early and extensive commerce carried on between Palestine and the East.  </p>
Cinnereth	<p>a harp, one of the "fenced cities" of Naphtali ( Joshua 19:35 ; Compare  Deuteronomy 3:17 ). It also denotes, apparently, a district which may have taken its name from the adjacent city or lake of Gennesaret, anciently called "the sea of Chinnereth" (q.v.), and was probably that enclosed district north of Tiberias afterwards called "the plain of Gennesaret." Called Chinneroth (RSV, Chinnereth)  Joshua 11:2 . The phrase "all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali" in  1 Kings 15:20  is parallel to "the store-houses of the cities of Naphtali" (RSV marg.) in  2 Chronicles 16:4 .  </p>
Circuit	<p>the apparent diurnal revolution of the sun round the earth ( Psalms 19:6 ), and the changes of the wind (Eccl  1:6 ). In  Job 22:14 , "in the circuit of heaven" (RSV marg., "on the vault of heaven") means the "arch of heaven," which seems to be bent over our heads.  </p>
Circumcision	<p>cutting around. This rite, practised before, as some think, by divers races, was appointed by God to be the special badge of his chosen people, an abiding sign of their consecration to him. It was established as a national ordinance ( Genesis 17:10 Genesis 17:11 ). In compliance with the divine command, Abraham, though ninety-nine years of age, was circumcised on the same day with Ishmael, who was thirteen years old ( 17:24-27 ). Slaves, whether home-born or purchased, were circumcised ( Genesis 17:12 Genesis 17:13 ); and all foreigners must have their males circumcised before they could enjoy the privileges of Jewish citizenship ( Exodus 12:48 ). During the journey through the wilderness, the practice of circumcision fell into disuse, but was resumed by the command of Joshua before they entered the Promised Land ( Joshua 5:2-9 ). It was observed always afterwards among the tribes of israel, although it is not expressly mentioned from the time of the settlement in Canaan till the time of Christ, about 1,450 years. The Jews prided themselves in the possession of this covenant distinction (Judg.  14:3 ;  15:18 ;  1 Samuel 14:6 ;  17:26 ;  2 Sam  1:20 ;  Ezekiel 31:18 ).  </p><p> As a rite of the church it ceased when the New Testament times began ( Galatians 6:15 ;  Colossians 3:11 ). Some Jewish Christians sought to impose it, however, on the Gentile converts; but this the apostles resolutely resisted ( Acts 15:1 ;  Galatians 6:12 ). Our Lord was circumcised, for it "became him to fulfil all righteousness," as of the seed of Abraham, according to the flesh; and Paul "took and circumcised" Timothy ( Acts 16:3 ), to avoid giving offence to the Jews. It would render Timothy's labours more acceptable to the Jews. But Paul would by no means consent to the demand that Titus should be circumcised ( Galatians 2:3-5 ). The great point for which he contended was the free admission of uncircumcised Gentiles into the church. He contended successfully in behalf of Titus, even in Jerusalem.  </p><p> In the Old Testament a spiritual idea is attached to circumcision. It was the symbol of purity ( Isaiah 52:1 ). We read of uncircumcised lips ( Exodus 6:12 Exodus 6:30 ), ears ( Jeremiah 6:10 ), hearts ( Leviticus 26:41 ). The fruit of a tree that is unclean is spoken of as uncircumcised ( Leviticus 19:23 ).  </p><p> It was a sign and seal of the covenant of grace as well as of the national covenant between God and the Hebrews. </p><li> It sealed the promises made to Abraham, which related to the commonwealth of Israel, national promises. </li><li> But the promises made to Abraham included the promise of redemption ( Galatians 3:14 ), a promise which has come upon us. The covenant with Abraham was a dispensation or a specific form of the covenant of grace, and circumcision was a sign and seal of that covenant. It had a spiritual meaning. It signified purification of the heart, inward circumcision effected by the Spirit ( Deuteronomy 10:16 ;  30:6 ;  Ezekiel 44:7 ;  Acts 7:51 ;  Romans 2:28 ;  Colossians 2:11 ). Circumcision as a symbol shadowing forth sanctification by the Holy Spirit has now given way to the symbol of baptism (q.v.). But the truth embodied in both ordinances is ever the same, the removal of sin, the sanctifying effects of grace in the heart.  <p> Under the Jewish dispensation, church and state were identical. No one could be a member of the one without also being a member of the other. Circumcision was a sign and seal of membership in both. Every circumcised person bore thereby evidence that he was one of the chosen people, a member of the church of God as it then existed, and consequently also a member of the Jewish commonwealth. </p> </li>
Cistern	<p>the rendering of a Hebrew word <i> bor</i> , which means a receptacle for water conveyed to it; distinguished from <i> beer</i> , which denotes a place where water rises on the spot ( Jeremiah 2:13 ;  Proverbs 5:15 ;  Isaiah 36:16 ), a fountain. Cisterns are frequently mentioned in Scripture. The scarcity of springs in Palestine made it necessary to collect rain-water in reservoirs and cisterns ( Numbers 21:22 ). (See WELL .) </p><p> Empty cisterns were sometimes used as prisons ( Jeremiah 38:6 ;  Lamentations 3:53 ;  Psalms 40:2 ;  69:15 ). The "pit" into which Joseph was cast ( Genesis 37:24 ) was a <i> beer</i> or dry well. There are numerous remains of ancient cisterns in all parts of Palestine. </p>
Citizenship	<p>the rights and privileges of a citizen in distinction from a foreigner ( Luke 15:15 ;  19:14 ;  Acts 21:39 ). Under the Mosaic law non-Israelites, with the exception of the Moabites and the Ammonites and others mentioned in  Deuteronomy 23:1-3 , were admitted to the general privileges of citizenship among the Jews ( Exodus 12:19 ;  Leviticus 24:22 ;  Numbers 15:15 ;  35:15 ;  Deuteronomy 10:18 ;  14:29 ;  Deuteronomy 16:10 Deuteronomy 16:14 ).  </p><p> The right of citizenship under the Roman government was granted by the emperor to individuals, and sometimes to provinces, as a favour or as a recompense for services rendered to the state, or for a sum of money ( Acts 22:28 ). This "freedom" secured privileges equal to those enjoyed by natives of Rome. Among the most notable of these was the provision that a man could not be bound or imprisoned without a formal trial ( Acts 22:25 Acts 22:26 ), or scourged ( 16:37 ). All Roman citizens had the right of appeal to Caesar ( 25:11 ).  </p>
City	<p>The earliest mention of city-building is that of Enoch, which was built by Cain ( Genesis 4:17 ). After the confusion of tongues, the descendants of Nimrod founded several cities ( 10:10-12 ). Next, we have a record of the cities of the Canaanites, Sidon, Gaza, Sodom, etc. ( Genesis 10:12 Genesis 10:19 ;  Genesis 11:3 Genesis 11:9 ;  36:31-39 ). The earliest description of a city is that of Sodom ( 19:1-22 ). Damascus is said to be the oldest existing city in the world. Before the time of Abraham there were cities in Egypt ( Numbers 13:22 ). The Israelites in Egypt were employed in building the "treasure cities" of Pithom and Raamses ( Exodus 1:11 ); but it does not seem that they had any cities of their own in Goshen ( Genesis 46:34 ;  47:1-11 ). In the kingdom of Og in Bashan there were sixty "great cities with walls," and twenty-three cities in Gilead partly rebuilt by the tribes on the east of Jordan ( Numbers 21:21 Numbers 21:32 Numbers 21:33 Numbers 21:35 ;  Numbers 32:1-3 Numbers 32:34-42 ;  Deuteronomy 3:4 Deuteronomy 3:5 Deuteronomy 3:14 ;  1 Kings 4:13 ). On the west of Jordan were thirty-one "royal cities" ( Joshua 12 ), besides many others spoken of in the history of Israel.  </p><p> A fenced city was a city surrounded by fortifications and high walls, with watch-towers upon them ( 2 Chronicles 11:11 ;  Deuteronomy 3:5 ). There was also within the city generally a tower to which the citizens might flee when danger threatened them ( Judges 9:46-52 ).  </p><p> A city with suburbs was a city surrounded with open pasture-grounds, such as the forty-eight cities which were given to the Levites ( Numbers 35:2-7 ). There were six cities of refuge, three on each side of Jordan, namely, Kadesh, Shechem, Hebron, on the west of Jordan; and on the east, Bezer, Ramoth-gilead, and Golan. The cities on each side of the river were nearly opposite each other. The regulations concerning these cities are given in  Numbers 35:9-34 ;  Deuteronomy 19:1-13 ;  Exodus 21:12-14 .  </p><p> When David reduced the fortress of the Jebusites which stood on Mount Zion, he built on the site of it a palace and a city, which he called by his own name ( 1 Chronicles 11:5 ), the city of David. Bethlehem is also so called as being David's native town ( Luke 2:4 ).  </p><p> Jerusalem is called the Holy City, the holiness of the temple being regarded as extending in some measure over the whole city ( Nehemiah 11:1 ).  </p><p> Pithom and Raamses, built by the Israelites as "treasure cities," were not places where royal treasures were kept, but were fortified towns where merchants might store their goods and transact their business in safety, or cities in which munitions of war were stored. (See PITHOM .) </p>
Clauda	<p>a small island off the southwest coast of Crete, passed by Paul on his voyage to Rome ( Acts 27:16 ). It is about 7 miles long and 3 broad. It is now called Gozzo (RSV, "Cauda").  </p>
Claudia	<p>a female Christian mentioned in  2 Timothy 4:21 . It is a conjecture having some probability that she was a British maiden, the daughter of king Cogidunus, who was an ally of Rome, and assumed the name of the emperor, his patron, Tiberius Claudius, and that she was the wife of Pudens.  </p>
Claudius	<p>lame. </p><li> The fourth Roman emperor. He succeeded Caligula (A.D. 41). Though in general he treated the Jews, especially those in Asia and Egypt, with great indulgence, yet about the middle of his reign (A.D. 49) he banished them all from Rome ( Acts 18:2 ). In this edict the Christians were included, as being, as was supposed, a sect of Jews. The Jews, however soon again returned to Rome.  <p> During the reign of this emperor, several persecutions of the Christians by the Jews took place in the dominions of Herod Agrippa, in one of which the apostle James was "killed" ( 12:2 ). He died A.D. 54.  </p></li><li> Claudius Lysias, a Greek who, having obtained by purchase the privilege of Roman citizenship, took the name of Claudius ( Acts 21:31-40 ;  22:28 ;  23:26 ).   </li>
Clay	<p>This word is used of sediment found in pits or in streets ( Isaiah 57:20 ;  Jeremiah 38:60 ), of dust mixed with spittle ( John 9:6 ), and of potter's clay ( Isaiah 41:25 ;  Nahum 3:14 ;  Jeremiah 18:1-6 ;  Romans 9:21 ). Clay was used for sealing ( Job 38:14 ;  Jeremiah 32:14 ). Our Lord's tomb may have been thus sealed ( Matthew 27:66 ). The practice of sealing doors with clay is still common in the East. Clay was also in primitive times used for mortar ( Genesis 11:3 ). The "clay ground" in which the large vessels of the temple were cast ( 1 Kings 7:46 ;  2 Chr  4:17 ) was a compact loam fitted for the purpose. The expression literally rendered is, "in the thickness of the ground,", meaning, "in stiff ground" or in clay.  </p>
Clean	<p>The various forms of uncleanness according to the Mosaic law are enumerated in  Leviticus 1115 -15;  Numbers 19 . The division of animals into clean and unclean was probably founded on the practice of sacrifice. It existed before the Flood ( Genesis 7:2 ). The regulations regarding such animals are recorded in  Leviticus 11  and  Deuteronomy 14:1-21 .  </p><p> The Hebrews were prohibited from using as food certain animal substances, such as (1) blood; (2) the fat covering the intestines, termed the caul; (3) the fat on the intestines, called the mesentery; (4) the fat of the kidneys; and (5) the fat tail of certain sheep ( Exodus 29:13 Exodus 29:22 ;  Leviticus 3:4-9 ;  9:19 ;  17:10 ;  19:26 ).  </p><p> The chief design of these regulations seems to have been to establish a system of regimen which would distinguish the Jews from all other nations. Regarding the design and the abolition of these regulations the reader will find all the details in  Leviticus 20:24-26 ;  Acts 10:9-16 ;  11:1-10 ;  Hebrews 9:9-14 .  </p>
Clement	<p>mild, a Christian of Philippi, Paul's "fellow-labourer," whose name he mentions as "in the book of life" (Phil  4:3 ). It was an opinion of ancient writers that he was the Clement of Rome whose name is well known in church history, and that he was the author of an Epistle to the Corinthians, the only known manuscript of which is appended to the Alexandrian Codex, now in the British Museum. It is of some historical interest, and has given rise to much discussion among critics. It makes distinct reference to Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians.  </p>
Cleopas	<p>(abbreviation of Cleopatros), one of the two disciples with whom Jesus conversed on the way to Emmaus on the day of the resurrection ( Luke 24:18 ). We know nothing definitely regarding him. It is not certain that he was the Clopas of  John 19:25 , or the Alphaeus of  Matthew 10:3 , although he may have been so.  </p>
Cleophas	<p>(in the spelling of this word <i> h</i> is inserted by mistake from Latin MSS.), rather Cleopas, which is the Greek form of the word, while Clopas is the Aramaic form. In  John 19:25  the Authorized Version reads, "Mary, the wife of Clopas." The word "wife" is conjecturally inserted here. If "wife" is rightly inserted, then Mary was the mother of James the Less, and Clopas is the same as Alphaeus ( Matthew 10:3 ;  27:56 ).  </p>
Cloak	<p>an upper garment, "an exterior tunic, wide and long, reaching to the ankles, but without sleeves" ( Isaiah 59:17 ). The word so rendered is elsewhere rendered "robe" or "mantle." It was worn by the high priest under the ephod ( Exodus 28:31 ), by kings and others of rank ( 1 Samuel 15:27 ;  Job 1:20 ;  2:12 ), and by women ( 2 Samuel 13:18 ).  </p><p> The word translated "cloke", i.e., outer garment, in  Matthew 5:40  is in its plural form used of garments in general ( Matthew 17:2 ;  26:65 ). The cloak mentioned here and in  Luke 6:29  was the Greek himation, Latin pallium, and consisted of a large square piece of wollen cloth fastened round the shoulders, like the abba of the Arabs. This could be taken by a creditor ( Exodus 22:26 Exodus 22:27 ), but the coat or tunic (Gr. chiton) mentioned in  Matthew 5:40  could not.  </p><p> The cloak which Paul "left at Troas" ( 2 Timothy 4:13 ) was the Roman paenula, a thick upper garment used chiefly in travelling as a protection from the weather. Some, however, have supposed that what Paul meant was a travelling-bag. In the Syriac version the word used means a bookcase. (See DRESS .) </p>
Closet	<p>as used in the New Testament, signifies properly a storehouse ( Luke 12: :  24 ), and hence a place of privacy and retirement ( Matthew 6:6 ;  Luke 12:3 ).  </p>
Cloud	<p>The Hebrew so rendered means "a covering," because clouds cover the sky. The word is used as a symbol of the Divine presence, as indicating the splendour of that glory which it conceals ( Exodus 16:10 ;  33:9 ;  Numbers 11:25 ;  12:5 ;  Job 22:14 ;  Psalms 18:11 ). A "cloud without rain" is a proverbial saying, denoting a man who does not keep his promise ( Proverbs 16:15 ;  Isaiah 18:4 ;  25:5 ;  Jude 1:12 ). A cloud is the figure of that which is transitory ( Job 30:15 ;  Hosea 6:4 ). A bright cloud is the symbolical seat of the Divine presence (Ex.29:42,43;  1 Kings 8:10 ;  2 Chr  5:14 ;  Ezekiel 43:4 ), and was called the Shechinah (q.v.). Jehovah came down upon Sinai in a cloud ( Exodus 19:9 ); and the cloud filled the court around the tabernacle in the wilderness so that Moses could not enter it ( Exodus 40:34 Exodus 40:35 ). At the dedication of the temple also the cloud "filled the house of the Lord" ( 1 Kings 8:10 ). Thus in like manner when Christ comes the second time he is described as coming "in the clouds" ( Matthew 17:5 ;  24:30 ;  Acts 1:9 Acts 1:11 ). False teachers are likened unto clouds carried about with a tempest ( 2 Peter 2:17 ). The infirmities of old age, which come one after another, are compared by Solomon to "clouds returning after the rain" (Eccl  12:2 ). The blotting out of sins is like the sudden disappearance of threatening clouds from the sky ( Isaiah 44:22 ).  </p><p> Cloud, the pillar of, was the glory-cloud which indicated God's presence leading the ransomed people through the wilderness ( Exodus 13:22 ;  Exodus 33:9 Exodus 33:10 ). This pillar preceded the people as they marched, resting on the ark ( Exodus 13:21 ;  40:36 ). By night it became a pillar of fire ( Numbers 9:17-23 ).  </p>
Cnidus	<p>a town and harbour on the extreme south-west of the peninsula of Doris in Asia Minor. Paul sailed past it on his voyage to Rome after leaving Myra ( Acts 27:7 ).  </p>
Coal	<p>It is by no means certain that the Hebrews were acquainted with mineral coal, although it is found in Syria. Their common fuel was dried dung of animals and wood charcoal. Two different words are found in Hebrew to denote coal, both occurring in  Proverbs 26:21 , "As coal [Heb. peham; i.e., "black coal"] is to burning coal [Heb. gehalim]." The latter of these words is used in  Job 41:21 ;  Proverbs 6:28 ;  Isaiah 44:19 . The words "live coal" in  Isaiah 6:6  are more correctly "glowing stone." In  Lamentations 4:8  the expression "blacker than a coal" is literally rendered in the margin of the Revised Version "darker than blackness." "Coals of fire" ( 2 Samuel 22:9 2 Samuel 22:13 ;  Psalms 18:8 Psalms 18:12 Psalms 18:13 , etc.) is an expression used metaphorically for lightnings proceeding from God. A false tongue is compared to "coals of juniper" ( Psalms 120:4 ;  James 3:6 ). "Heaping coals of fire on the head" symbolizes overcoming evil with good. The words of Paul ( Romans 12:20 ) are equivalent to saying, "By charity and kindness thou shalt soften down his enmity as surely as heaping coals on the fire fuses the metal in the crucible."  </p>
Coat	<p>the tunic worn like the shirt next the skin ( Leviticus 16:4 ; Cant.  5:3 ;  2 Sam  15:32 ;  Exodus 28:4 ;  29:5 ). The "coats of skins" prepared by God for Adam and Eve were probably nothing more than aprons ( Genesis 3:21 ). This tunic was sometimes woven entire without a seam ( John 19:23 ); it was also sometimes of "many colours" ( Genesis 37:3 ; RSV marg., "a long garment with sleeves"). The "fisher's coat" of  John 21:7  was obviously an outer garment or cloak, as was also the "coat" made by Hannah for Samuel ( 1 Samuel 2:19 ). (See DRESS .) </p>
Coat of mail	<p>the rendering of a Hebrew word meaning "glittering" ( 1 Samuel 17:5 1 Samuel 17:38 ). The same word in the plural form is translated "habergeons" in  2 Chronicles 26:14  and  Nehemiah 4:16 . The "harness" ( 1 Kings 22:34 ), "breastplate" ( Isaiah 59:17 ), and "brigandine" ( Jeremiah 46:4 ), were probably also corselets or coats of mail. (See ARMOUR .) </p>
Cockatrice	<p>the mediaeval name (a corruption of "crocodile") of a fabulous serpent supposed to be produced from a cock's egg. It is generally supposed to denote the cerastes, or "horned viper," a very poisonous serpent about a foot long. Others think it to be the yellow viper (Daboia xanthina), one of the most dangerous vipers, from its size and its nocturnal habits ( Isaiah 11:8 ;  14:29 ;  59:5 ;  Jeremiah 8:17 ; in all which the Revised Version renders the Hebrew <i> tziph'oni</i> by "basilisk"). In  Proverbs 23:32  the Hebrew <i> tzeph'a</i> is rendered both in the Authorized Version and the Revised Version by "adder;" margin of Revised Version "basilisk," and of Authorized Version "cockatrice." </p>
Cock-crowing	<p>In our Lord's time the Jews had adopted the Greek and Roman division of the night into four watches, each consisting of three hours, the first beginning at six o'clock in the evening ( Luke 12:38 ;  Matthew 14:25 ;  Mark 6:48 ). But the ancient division, known as the first and second cock-crowing, was still retained. The cock usually crows several times soon after midnight (this is the first crowing), and again at the dawn of day (and this is the second crowing). Mark mentions ( 14:30 ) the two cock-crowings. ( Matthew 26:34 ) alludes to that only which was emphatically the cock-crowing, viz, the second.  </p>
Cockle	<p>occurs only in  Job 31:40  (marg., "noisome weeds"), where it is the rendering of a Hebrew word (b'oshah) which means "offensive," "having a bad smell," referring to some weed perhaps which has an unpleasant odour. Or it may be regarded as simply any noisome weed, such as the "tares" or darnel of  Matthew 13:30 . In Isa 5:2,4the plural form is rendered "wild grapes."  </p>
Coele-Syria	<p>hollow Syria, the name (not found in Scripture) given by the Greeks to the extensive valley, about 100 miles long, between the Lebanon and the Anti-Lebanon range of mountains.  </p>
Coffer	<p>the receptacle or small box placed beside the ark by the Philistines, in which they deposited the golden mice and the emerods as their trespass-offering ( 1 Samuel 6:8 1 Samuel 6:11 1 Samuel 6:15 ).  </p>
Coffin	<p>used in  Genesis 50:26  with reference to the burial of Joseph. Here, it means a mummy-chest. The same Hebrew word is rendered "chest" in  2 Kings 12:9 2 Kings 12:10 .  </p>
Cogitations	<p>(or "thoughts," as the Chaldee word in  Daniel 7:28  literally means), earnest meditation.  </p>
Coin	<p>Before the Exile the Jews had no regularly stamped money. They made use of uncoined shekels or talents of silver, which they weighed out ( Genesis 23:16 ;  Exodus 38:24 ;  2 Sam  18:12 ). Probably the silver ingots used in the time of Abraham may have been of a fixed weight, which was in some way indicated on them. The "pieces of silver" paid by Abimelech to Abraham ( Genesis 20:16 ), and those also for which Joseph was sold ( 37:28 ), were proably in the form of rings. The shekel was the common standard of weight and value among the Hebrews down to the time of the Captivity. Only once is a shekel of gold mentioned ( 1 Chronicles 21:25 ). The "six thousand of gold" mentioned in the transaction between Naaman and Gehazi ( 2 Kings 5:5 ) were probably so many shekels of gold. The "piece of money" mentioned in  Job 42:11 ;  Genesis 33:19  (marg., "lambs") was the Hebrew <i> kesitah</i> , probably an uncoined piece of silver of a certain weight in the form of a sheep or lamb, or perhaps having on it such an impression. The same Hebrew word is used in  Joshua 24:32 , which is rendered by Wickliffe "an hundred yonge scheep."  </p>
Collar	<p>(Heb. peh), means in  Job 30:18  the mouth or opening of the garment that closes round the neck in the same way as a tunic ( Exodus 39:23 ). The "collars" (Heb. netiphoth) among the spoils of the Midianites ( Judges 8:26 ; RSV, "pendants") were ear-drops. The same Hebrew word is rendered "chains" in  Isaiah 3:19 .  </p>
Collection	<p>The Christians in Palestine, from various causes, suffered from poverty. Paul awakened an interest in them among the Gentile churches, and made pecuniary collections in their behalf ( Acts 24:17 ;  Romans 15:25 Romans 15:26 ;  1 Corinthians 16:1-3 ;  2 co  8:9 ;  Galatians 2:10 ).  </p>
College	<p>Heb. mishneh ( 2 Kings 22:14 ;  2 Chr  34:22 ), rendered in Revised Version "second quarter", the residence of the prophetess Huldah. The Authorized Version followed the Jewish commentators, who, following the Targum, gave the Hebrew word its post-Biblical sense, as if it meant a place of instruction. It properly means the "second," and may therefore denote the lower city (Acra), which was built after the portion of the city on Mount Zion, and was enclosed by a second wall.  </p>
Colony	<p>The city of Philippi was a Roman colony ( Acts 16:12 ), i.e., a military settlement of Roman soldiers and citizens, planted there to keep in subjection a newly-conquered district. A colony was Rome in miniature, under Roman municipal law, but governed by military officers (praetors and lictors), not by proconsuls. It had an independent internal government, the jus Italicum; i.e., the privileges of Italian citizens.  </p>
Colossae	<p>or Colosse, a city of Phrygia, on the Lycus, which is a tributary of the Maeander. It was about 12 miles above Laodicea, and near the great road from Ephesus to the Euphrates, and was consequently of some mercantile importance. It does not appear that Paul had visited this city when he wrote his letter to the church there ( Colossians 1:2 ). He expresses in his letter to Philemon (ver  1:22 ) his hope to visit it on being delivered from his imprisonment. From  Colossians 1:7 ;  4:12  it has been concluded that Epaphras was the founder of the Colossian church. This town afterwards fell into decay, and the modern town of Chonas or Chonum occupies a site near its ruins.  </p>
Colossians, Epistle to the	<p>was written by Paul at Rome during his first imprisonment there ( Acts 28:16 Acts 28:30 ), probably in the spring of A.D. 57, or, as some think, 62, and soon after he had written his Epistle to the Ephesians. Like some of his other epistles (e.g., those to Corinth), this seems to have been written in consequence of information which had somehow been conveyed to him of the internal state of the church there ( Colossians 1:4-8 ). Its object was to counteract false teaching. A large part of it is directed against certain speculatists who attempted to combine the doctrines of Oriental mysticism and asceticism with Christianity, thereby promising the disciples the enjoyment of a higher spiritual life and a deeper insight into the world of spirits. Paul argues against such teaching, showing that in Christ Jesus they had all things. He sets forth the majesty of his redemption. The mention of the "new moon" and "sabbath days" ( 2:16 ) shows also that there were here Judaizing teachers who sought to draw away the disciples from the simplicity of the gospel.  </p><p> Like most of Paul's epistles, this consists of two parts, a doctrinal and a practical. </p><li> The doctrinal part comprises the first two chapters. His main theme is developed in chapter 2. He warns them against being drawn away from Him in whom dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead, and who was the head of all spiritual powers. Christ was the head of the body of which they were members; and if they were truly united to him, what needed they more?  </li><li> The practical part of the epistle (3-4) enforces various duties naturally flowing from the doctrines expounded. They are exhorted to mind things that are above ( 3:1-4 ), to mortify every evil principle of their nature, and to put on the new man ( 3:5-14 ). Many special duties of the Christian life are also insisted upon as the fitting evidence of the Christian character. Tychicus was the bearer of the letter, as he was also of that to the Ephesians and to Philemon, and he would tell them of the state of the apostle ( 4:7-9 ). After friendly greetings (10-14), he bids them interchange this letter with that he had sent to the neighbouring church of Laodicea. He then closes this brief but striking epistle with his usual autograph salutation. There is a remarkable resemblance between this epistle and that to the Ephesians (q.v.). The genuineness of this epistle has not been called in question.   </li>
Colour	<p>The subject of colours holds an important place in the Scriptures. </p><p> White occurs as the translation of various Hebrew words. It is applied to milk ( Genesis 49:12 ), manna ( Exodus 16:31 ), snow ( Isaiah 1:18 ), horses ( Zechariah 1:8 ), raiment (Eccl  9:8 ). Another Hebrew word so rendered is applied to marble ( Esther 1:6 ), and a cognate word to the lily (Cant  2:16 ). A different term, meaning "dazzling," is applied to the countenance (Cant  5:10 ).  </p><p> This colour was an emblem of purity and innocence ( Mark 16:5 ;  John 20:12 ;  Revelation 19:8 Revelation 19:14 ), of joy (Eccl  9:8 ), and also of victory ( Zechariah 6:3 ;  Revelation 6:2 ). The hangings of the tabernacle court ( Exodus 27:9 ;  38:9 ), the coats, mitres, bonnets, and breeches of the priests ( Exodus 39:27 Exodus 39:28 ), and the dress of the high priest on the day of Atonement ( Leviticus 16:4 Leviticus 16:32 ), were white.  </p><p> Black, applied to the hair ( Leviticus 13:31 ; Cant  5:11 ), the complexion (Cant  1:5 ), and to horses ( Zechariah 6:2 Zechariah 6:6 ). The word rendered "brown" in  Genesis 30:32  (RSV, "black") means properly "scorched", i.e., the colour produced by the influence of the sun's rays. "Black" in  Job 30:30  means dirty, blackened by sorrow and disease. The word is applied to a mourner's robes ( Jeremiah 8:21 ;  14:2 ), to a clouded sky ( 1 Kings 18:45 ), to night ( Micah 3:6 ;  Jeremiah 4:28 ), and to a brook rendered turbid by melted snow ( Job 6:16 ). It is used as symbolical of evil in Zech 6:2,6and  Revelation 6:5 . It was the emblem of mourning, affliction, calamity ( Jeremiah 14:2 ;  Lamentations 4:8 ;  5:10 ).  </p><p> Red, applied to blood ( <span class="badLink">2 Kings 322</span> ;22), a heifer ( Numbers 19:2 ), pottage of lentils ( Genesis 25:30 ), a horse ( Zechariah 1:8 ), wine ( Proverbs 23:31 ), the complexion ( Genesis 25:25 ; Cant  5:10 ). This colour is symbolical of bloodshed ( Zechariah 6:2 ;  Revelation 6:4 ;  12:3 ).  </p><p> Purple, a colour obtained from the secretion of a species of shell-fish (the Murex trunculus) which was found in the Mediterranean, and particularly on the coasts of Phoenicia and Asia Minor. The colouring matter in each separate shell-fish amounted to only a single drop, and hence the great value of this dye. Robes of this colour were worn by kings ( Judges 8:26 ) and high officers ( Esther 8:15 ). They were also worn by the wealthy and luxurious ( Jeremiah 10:9 ;  Ezekiel 27:7 ;  Luke 16:19 ;  Revelation 17:4 ). With this colour was associated the idea of royalty and majesty ( Judges 8:26 ; Cant  3:10 ;  7:5 ;  Daniel 5:7 Daniel 5:16 Daniel 5:29 ).  </p><p> Blue. This colour was also procured from a species of shell-fish, the chelzon of the Hebrews, and the Helix ianthina of modern naturalists. The tint was emblematic of the sky, the deep dark hue of the Eastern sky. This colour was used in the same way as purple. The ribbon and fringe of the Hebrew dress were of this colour ( Numbers 15:38 ). The loops of the curtains ( Exodus 26:4 ), the lace of the high priest's breastplate, the robe of the ephod, and the lace on his mitre, were blue ( Exodus 28:28 Exodus 28:31 Exodus 28:37 ).  </p><p> Scarlet, or Crimson. In  Isaiah 1:18  a Hebrew word is used which denotes the worm or grub whence this dye was procured. In  Genesis 38:28 Genesis 38:30 , the word so rendered means "to shine," and expresses the brilliancy of the colour. The small parasitic insects from which this dye was obtained somewhat resembled the cochineal which is found in Eastern countries. It is called by naturalists Coccus ilics. The dye was procured from the female grub alone. The only natural object to which this colour is applied in Scripture is the lips, which are likened to a scarlet thread (Cant  4:3 ). Scarlet robes were worn by the rich and luxurious ( 2 Samuel 1:24 ;  Proverbs 31:21 ;  Jeremiah 4:30 .  Revelation 17:4 ). It was also the hue of the warrior's dress ( Nahum 2:3 ;  Isaiah 9:5 ). The Phoenicians excelled in the art of dyeing this colour ( 2 Chronicles 2:7 ).  </p><p> These four colours--white, purple, blue, and scarlet--were used in the textures of the tabernacle curtains ( Exodus 26:1 Exodus 26:31 Exodus 26:36 ), and also in the high priest's ephod, girdle, and breastplate ( Exodus 28:5 Exodus 28:6 Exodus 28:8 Exodus 28:15 ). Scarlet thread is mentioned in connection with the rites of cleansing the leper ( Leviticus 14:4 Leviticus 14:6 Leviticus 14:51 ) and of burning the red heifer ( Numbers 19:6 ). It was a crimson thread that Rahab was to bind on her window as a sign that she was to be saved alive ( Joshua 2:18 ;  6:25 ) when the city of Jericho was taken.  </p><p> Vermilion, the red sulphuret of mercury, or cinnabar; a colour used for drawing the figures of idols on the walls of temples ( Ezekiel 23:14 ), or for decorating the walls and beams of houses ( Jeremiah 22:14 ).  </p>
Comforter	<p>the designation of the Holy Ghost ( John 14:16 John 14:26 ;  15:26 ;  16:7 ; RSV marg., "or Advocate, or Helper; Gr. paracletos"). The same Greek word thus rendered is translated "Advocate" in  1 John 2:1  as applicable to Christ. It means properly "one who is summoned to the side of another" to help him in a court of justice by defending him, "one who is summoned to plead a cause." "Advocate" is the proper rendering of the word in every case where it occurs.  </p><p> It is worthy of notice that although Paul nowhere uses the word paracletos, he yet presents the idea it embodies when he speaks of the "intercession" both of Christ and the Spirit ( Romans 8:27 Romans 8:34 ).  </p>
Coming of Christ	<p>(1) with reference to his first advent "in the fulness of the time" ( 1 John 5:20 ;  2 John  1:7 ), or (2) with reference to his coming again the second time at the last day ( Acts 1:11 ;  Acts 3:20 Acts 3:21 ;  1 Thessalonians 4:15 ;  2 Tim  4:1 ;  Hebrews 9:28 ).  </p><p> The expression is used metaphorically of the introduction of the gospel into any place ( John 15:22 ;  Ephesians 2:17 ), the visible establishment of his kingdom in the world ( Matthew 16:28 ), the conferring on his people of the peculiar tokens of his love ( John 14:18 John 14:23 John 14:28 ), and his executing judgment on the wicked ( 2 Thessalonians 2:8 ).  </p>
Commandments, the Ten	<p>( Exodus 34:28 ;  Deuteronomy 10:4 , marg. "ten words") i.e., the Decalogue (q.v.), is a summary of the immutable moral law. These commandments were first given in their written form to the people of Israel when they were encamped at Sinai, about fifty days after they came out of Egypt ( Exodus 19:10-25 ). They were written by the finger of God on two tables of stone. The first tables were broken by Moses when he brought them down from the mount ( 32:19 ), being thrown by him on the ground. At the command of God he took up into the mount two other tables, and God wrote on them "the words that were on the first tables" ( 34:1 ). These tables were afterwards placed in the ark of the covenant ( Deuteronomy 10:5 ;  1 Kings 8:9 ). Their subsequent history is unknown. They are as a whole called "the covenant" ( Deuteronomy 4:13 ), and "the tables of the covenant" ( Deuteronomy 9:9 Deuteronomy 9:11 ;  Hebrews 9:4 ), and "the testimony."  </p><p> They are obviously "ten" in number, but their division is not fixed, hence different methods of numbering them have been adopted. The Jews make the "Preface" one of the commandments, and then combine the first and second. The Roman Catholics and Lutherans combine the first and second and divide the tenth into two. The Jews and Josephus divide them equally. The Lutherans and Roman Catholics refer three commandments to the first table and seven to the second. The Greek and Reformed Churches refer four to the first and six to the second table. The Samaritans add to the second that Gerizim is the mount of worship. (See LAW .) </p>
Communion	<p>fellowship with God ( Genesis 18:17-33 ;  Exodus 33:9-11 ;  Numbers 12:7 Numbers 12:8 ), between Christ and his people ( John 14:23 ), by the Spirit ( 2 Corinthians 13:14 ; Phil  2:1 ), of believers with one another ( Ephesians 4:1-6 ). The Lord's Supper is so called ( 1 Corinthians 10:16 1 Corinthians 10:17 ), because in it there is fellowship between Christ and his disciples, and of the disciples with one another.  </p>
Conaniah	<p>whom Jehovah hath set, a Levite placed over the tithes brought into the temple ( 2 Chronicles 35:9 ).  </p>
Concision	<p>(Gr. katatome; i.e., "mutilation"), a term used by Paul contemptuously of those who were zealots for circumcision ( Philippians 3:2 ). Instead of the warning, "Beware of the circumcision" (peritome) i.e., of the party who pressed on Gentile converts the necessity of still observing that ordinance, he says, "Beware of the concision;" as much as to say, "This circumcision which they vaunt of is in Christ only as the gashings and mutilations of idolatrous heathen."  </p>
Concubine	<p>in the Bible denotes a female conjugally united to a man, but in a relation inferior to that of a wife. Among the early Jews, from various causes, the difference between a wife and a concubine was less marked than it would be amongst us. The concubine was a wife of secondary rank. There are various laws recorded providing for their protection ( Exodus 21:7 ;  Deuteronomy 21:10-14 ), and setting limits to the relation they sustained to the household to which they belonged ( Genesis 21:14 ;  25:6 ). They had no authority in the family, nor could they share in the household government.  </p><p> The immediate cause of concubinage might be gathered from the conjugal histories of Abraham and Jacob ( Genesis 1630 ;30). But in process of time the custom of concubinage degenerated, and laws were made to restrain and regulate it ( Exodus 21:7-9 ).  </p><p> Christianity has restored the sacred institution of marriage to its original character, and concubinage is ranked with the sins of fornication and adultery ( Matthew 19:5-9 ;  1 Corinthians 7:2 ).  </p>
Concupiscence	<p>desire,  Romans 7:8  (RSV, "coveting");  Colossians 3:5  (RSV, "desire"). The "lust of concupiscence" ( 1 Thessalonians 4:5 ; RSV, "passion of lust") denotes evil desire, indwelling sin.  </p>
Conduit	<p>a water-course or channel ( Job 38:25 ). The "conduit of the upper pool" ( Isaiah 7:3 ) was formed by Hezekiah for the purpose of conveying the waters from the upper pool in the valley of Gihon to the west side of the city of David ( 2 Kings 18:17 ;  20:20 ;  2 Chr  <span class="badLink">32:30</span> ). In carrying out this work he stopped "the waters of the fountains which were without the city" i.e., "the upper water-course of Gihon", and conveyed it down from the west through a canal into the city, so that in case of a siege the inhabitants of the city might have a supply of water, which would thus be withdrawn from the enemy. (See SILOAM .) </p><p> There are also the remains of a conduit which conducted water from the so-called "Pools of Solomon," beyond Bethlehem, into the city. Water is still conveyed into the city from the fountains which supplied these pools by a channel which crosses the valley of Hinnom. </p>
Coney	<p>(Heb. shaphan; i.e., "the hider"), an animal which inhabits the mountain gorges and the rocky districts of Arabia Petraea and the Holy Land. "The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks" ( Proverbs 30:26 ;  Psalms 104:18 ). They are gregarious, and "exceeding wise" ( Proverbs 30:24 ), and are described as chewing the cud ( Leviticus 11:5 ;  Deuteronomy 14:7 ).  </p><p> The animal intended by this name is known among naturalists as the Hyrax Syriacus. It is neither a ruminant nor a rodent, but is regarded as akin to the rhinoceros. When it is said to "chew the cud," the Hebrew word so used does not necessarily imply the possession of a ruminant stomach. "The lawgiver speaks according to appearances; and no one can watch the constant motion of the little creature's jaws, as it sits continually working its teeth, without recognizing the naturalness of the expression" (Tristram, Natural History of the Bible). It is about the size and color of a rabbit, though clumsier in structure, and without a tail. Its feet are not formed for digging, and therefore it has its home not in burrows but in the clefts of the rocks. "Coney" is an obsolete English word for "rabbit." </p>
Confection	<p>( Exodus 30:35 , "ointment" in ver. 25; RSV, "perfume"). The Hebrew word so rendered is derived from a root meaning to compound oil and perfume.  </p>
Confectionaries	<p>only in  1 Samuel 8:13 , those who make confections, i.e., perfumers, who compound species and perfumes.  </p>
Confession	<p>(1) An open profession of faith ( Luke 12:8 ). </p><li> An acknowledment of sins to God ( Leviticus 16:21 ;  Ezra 9:5-15 ;  Daniel 9:3-12 ), and to a neighbour whom we have wronged ( James 5:16 ;  Matthew 18:15 ).   </li>
Congregation	<p>(Heb. kahal), the Hebrew people collectively as a holy community ( Numbers 15:15 ). Every circumcised Hebrew from twenty years old and upward was a member of the congregation. Strangers resident in the land, if circumcised, were, with certain exceptions ( Exodus 12:19 ;  Numbers 9:14 ;  Deuteronomy 23:1-3 ), admitted to the privileges of citizenship, and spoken of as members of the congregation ( Exodus 12:19 ;  Numbers 9:14 ;  15:15 ). The congregation were summonded together by the sound of two silver trumpets, and they met at the door of the tabernacle ( Numbers 10:3 ). These assemblies were convened for the purpose of engaging in solemn religious services ( Exodus 12:27 ;  Numbers 25:6 ;  Joel 2:15 ), or of receiving new commandments ( Exodus 19:7 Exodus 19:8 ). The elders, who were summonded by the sound of one trumpet ( Numbers 10:4 ), represented on various occasions the whole congregation ( Exodus 3:16 ;  12:21 ;  17:5 ;  24:1 ).  </p><p> After the conquest of Canaan, the people were assembled only on occasions of the highest national importance (Judg. 20;  2 Chronicles 30:5 ;  34:29 ;  1 Samuel 10:17 ;  2 Sam  5:1-5 ;  1 Kings 12:20 ;  2 Kings  11:19 ;  21:24 ;  <span class="badLink">23:30</span> ). In subsequent times the congregation was represented by the Sanhedrim; and the name synagogue, applied in the Septuagint version exclusively to the congregation, came to be used to denote the places of worship established by the Jews. (See CHURCH .) </p><p> In  Acts 13:43 , where alone it occurs in the New Testament, it is the same word as that rendered "synagogue" (q.v.) in ver. 42, and is so rendered in ver. 43 in RSV  </p>
Congregation, mount of the	<p>( Isaiah 14:13 ), has been supposed to refer to the place where God promised to meet with his people ( Exodus 25:22 ;  Exodus 29:42 Exodus 29:43 ) i.e., the mount of the Divine presence, Mount Zion. But here the king of Babylon must be taken as expressing himself according to his own heathen notions, and not according to those of the Jews. The "mount of the congregation" will therefore in this case mean the northern mountain, supposed by the Babylonians to be the meeting-place of their gods. In the Babylonian inscriptions mention is made of a mountain which is described as "the mighty mountain of Bel, whose head rivals heaven, whose root is the holy deep." This mountain was regarded in their mythology as the place where the gods had their seat.  </p>
Conscience	<p>that faculty of the mind, or inborn sense of right and wrong, by which we judge of the moral character of human conduct. It is common to all men. Like all our other faculties, it has been perverted by the Fall ( John 16:2 ;  Acts 26:9 ;  Romans 2:15 ). It is spoken of as "defiled" ( Titus 1:15 ), and "seared" ( 1 Timothy 4:2 ). A "conscience void of offence" is to be sought and cultivated ( Acts 24:16 ;  Romans 9:1 ;  2 co  1:12 ;  1 Timothy 1:5 1 Timothy 1:19 ;  1 Peter 3:21 ).  </p>
Consecration	<p>the devoting or setting apart of anything to the worship or service of God. The race of Abraham and the tribe of Levi were thus consecrated ( Exodus 13:2 Exodus 13:12 Exodus 13:15 ;  Numbers 3:12 ). The Hebrews devoted their fields and cattle, and sometimes the spoils of war, to the Lord ( Leviticus 27:28 Leviticus 27:29 ). According to the Mosaic law the first-born both of man and beast were consecrated to God.  </p><p> In the New Testament, Christians are regarded as consecrated to the Lord ( 1 Peter 2:9 ).  </p>
Consolation of Israel	<p>a name for the Messiah in common use among the Jews, probably suggested by  Isaiah 12:1 ;  49:13 . The Greek word thus rendered ( Luke 2:25 , paraklesis) is kindred to that translated "Comforter" in  John 14:16 , etc., parakletos.  </p>
Constellation	<p>a cluster of stars, or stars which appear to be near each other in the heavens, and which astronomers have reduced to certain figures (as the "Great Bear," the "Bull," etc.) for the sake of classification and of memory. In  Isaiah 13:10 , where this word only occurs, it is the rendering of the Hebrew <i> kesil</i> , i.e., "fool." This was the Hebrew name of the constellation Orion ( Job 9:9 ;  38:31 ), a constellation which represented Nimrod, the symbol of folly and impiety. The word some interpret by "the giant" in this place, "some heaven-daring rebel who was chained to the sky for his impiety."  </p>
Contentment	<p>a state of mind in which one's desires are confined to his lot whatever it may be ( 1 Timothy 6:6 ;  2 co  9:8 ). It is opposed to envy ( James 3:16 ), avarice ( Hebrews 13:5 ), ambition ( Proverbs 13:10 ), anxiety ( Matthew 6:25 Matthew 6:34 ), and repining ( 1 Corinthians 10:10 ). It arises from the inward disposition, and is the offspring of humility, and of an intelligent consideration of the rectitude and benignity of divine providence ( Psalms 96:1 Psalms 96:2 ;  145 ), the greatness of the divine promises ( 2 Peter 1:4 ), and our own unworthiness ( Genesis 32:10 ); as well as from the view the gospel opens up to us of rest and peace hereafter ( Romans 5:2 ).  </p>
Conversation	<p>generally the goings out and in of social intercourse ( Ephesians 2:3 ;  4:22 ; RSV, "manner of life"); one's deportment or course of life. This word is never used in Scripture in the sense of verbal communication from one to another ( Psalms 50:23 ;  Hebrews 13:5 ). In Phil  <span class="badLink">1:27</span>  and  3:20 , a different Greek word is used. It there means one's relations to a community as a citizen, i.e., citizenship.  </p>
Conversion	<p>the turning of a sinner to God ( Acts 15:3 ). In a general sense the heathen are said to be "converted" when they abandon heathenism and embrace the Christian faith; and in a more special sense men are converted when, by the influence of divine grace in their souls, their whole life is changed, old things pass away, and all things become new ( Acts 26:18 ). Thus we speak of the conversion of the Philippian jailer ( 16:19-34 ), of Paul ( 9:1-22 ), of the Ethiopian treasurer ( 8:26-40 ), of Cornelius (10), of Lydia ( 16:13-15 ), and others. (See REGENERATION .) </p>
Convocation	<p>a meeting of a religious character as distinguished from congregation, which was more general, dealing with political and legal matters. Hence it is called an "holy convocation." Such convocations were the Sabbaths ( Leviticus 23:2 Leviticus 23:3 ), the Passover ( Exodus 12:16 ;  Leviticus 23:7 Leviticus 23:8 ;  Numbers 28:25 ), Pentecost ( Leviticus 23:21 ), the feast of Trumpets ( Leviticus 23:24 ;  Numbers 29:1 ), the feast of Weeks ( Numbers 28:26 ), and the feast of Tabernacles ( Leviticus 23:35 Leviticus 23:36 ). The great fast, the annual day of atonement, was "the holy convocation" ( Leviticus 23:27 ;  Numbers 29:7 ).  </p>
Cook	<p>a person employed to perform culinary service. In early times among the Hebrews cooking was performed by the mistress of the household ( Genesis 18:2-6 ;  Judges 6:19 ), and the process was very expeditiously performed ( Genesis 27:3 Genesis 27:4 Genesis 27:9 Genesis 27:10 ). Professional cooks were afterwards employed ( 1 Samuel 8:13 ;  9:23 ). Few animals, as a rule, were slaughtered (other than sacrifices), except for purposes of hospitality ( Genesis 18:7 ;  Luke 15:23 ). The paschal lamb was roasted over a fire ( Exodus 12:8 Exodus 12:9 ;  2 Chr  35:13 ). Cooking by boiling was the usual method adopted ( Leviticus 8:31 ;  Exodus 16:23 ). No cooking took place on the Sabbath day ( Exodus 35:3 ).  </p>
Coos	<p>(written Cos in the RSV), a small island, one of the Sporades in the Aegean Sea, in the north-west of Rhodes, off the coast of Caria. Paul on his return from his third missionary journey, passed the night here after sailing from Miletus ( Acts 21:1 ). It is now called Stanchio.  </p>
Copper	<p>derived from the Greek kupros (the island of Cyprus), called "Cyprian brass," occurs only in the Authorized Version in  Ezra 8:27 . Elsewhere the Hebrew word (nehosheth) is improperly rendered "brass," and sometimes "steel" ( 2 Samuel 22:35 ;  Jeremiah 15:12 ). The "bow of steel" ( Job 20:24 ;  Psalms 18:34 ) should have been "bow of copper" (or "brass," as in the RSV). The vessels of "fine copper" of  Ezra 8:27  were probably similar to those of "bright brass" mentioned in  1 Kings 7:45 ;  Daniel 10:6 .  </p><p> Tubal-cain was the first artificer in brass and iron ( Genesis 4:22 ). Hiram was noted as a worker in brass ( 1 Kings 7:14 ). Copper abounded in Palestine ( Deuteronomy 8:9 ;  Isaiah 60:17 ;  1 Chronicles 22:3 1 Chronicles 22:14 ). All sorts of vessels in the tabernacle and the temple were made of it ( Leviticus 6:28 ;  Numbers 16:39 ;  2 Chr  4:16 ;  Ezra 8:27 ); also weapons of war ( 1 Samuel 17:5 1 Samuel 17:6 1 Samuel 17:38 ;  2 Sam  <span class="badLink">21:16</span> ). Iron is mentioned only four times ( Genesis 4:22 ;  Leviticus 26:19 ;  Numbers 31:22 ;  35:16 ) in the first four books of Moses, while copper (rendered "brass") is mentioned forty times. (See BRASS .) </p><p> We find mention of Alexander (q.v.), a "coppersmith" of Ephesus ( 2 Timothy 4:14 ).  </p>
Cor	<p>This Hebrew word, untranslated, denotes a round vessel used as a measure both for liquids and solids. It was equal to one homer, and contained ten ephahs in dry and ten baths in liquid measure ( Ezekiel 45:14 ). The Rabbins estimated the cor at forty-five gallons, while Josephus estimated it at about eighty-seven. In  1 Kings 4:22 ;  5:11 ;  2 Chr  2:10 ;  27:5 , the original word is rendered "measure."  </p>
Coral	<p>Heb. ramoth, meaning "heights;" i.e., "high-priced" or valuable things, or, as some suppose, "that which grows high," like a tree ( Job 28:18 ;  Ezekiel 27:16 ), according to the Rabbins, red coral, which was in use for ornaments.  </p><p> The coral is a cretaceous marine product, the deposit by minute polypous animals of calcareous matter in cells in which the animal lives. It is of numberless shapes as it grows, but usually is branched like a tree. Great coral reefs and coral islands abound in the Red Sea, whence probably the Hebrews derived their knowledge of it. It is found of different colours, white, black, and red. The red, being esteemed the most precious, was used, as noticed above, for ornamental purposes. </p>
Corban	<p>a Hebrew word adopted into the Greek of the New Testament and left untranslated. It occurs only once ( Mark 7:11 ). It means a gift or offering consecrated to God. Anything over which this word was once pronounced was irrevocably dedicated to the temple. Land, however, so dedicated might be redeemed before the year of jubilee ( Leviticus 27:16-24 ). Our Lord condemns the Pharisees for their false doctrine, inasmuch as by their traditions they had destroyed the commandment which requires children to honour their father and mother, teaching them to find excuse from helping their parents by the device of pronouncing "Corban" over their goods, thus reserving them to their own selfish use.  </p>
Cord	<p>frequently used in its proper sense, for fastening a tent ( Exodus 35:18 ;  39:40 ), yoking animals to a cart ( Isaiah 5:18 ), binding prisoners ( Judges 15:13 ;  Psalms 2:3 ;  129:4 ), and measuring ground ( <span class="badLink">2 Samuel 82</span> ;2;  Psalms 78:55 ). Figuratively, death is spoken of as the giving way of the tent-cord ( Job 4:21 . "Is not their tent-cord plucked up?" RSV). To gird one's self with a cord was a token of sorrow and humiliation. To stretch a line over a city meant to level it with the ground ( Lamentations 2:8 ). The "cords of sin" are the consequences or fruits of sin ( Proverbs 5:22 ). A "threefold cord" is a symbol of union (Eccl  4:12 ). The "cords of a man" ( Hosea 11:4 ) means that men employ, in inducing each other, methods such as are suitable to men, and not "cords" such as oxen are led by. ( Isaiah 5:18 ) says, "Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope." This verse is thus given in the Chaldee paraphrase: "Woe to those who begin to sin by little and little, drawing sin by cords of vanity: these sins grow and increase till they are strong and are like a cart rope." This may be the true meaning. The wicked at first draw sin with a slender cord; but by-and-by their sins increase, and they are drawn after them by a cart rope. Henderson in his commentary says: "The meaning is that the persons described were not satisfied with ordinary modes of provoking the Deity, and the consequent ordinary approach of his vengeance, but, as it were, yoked themselves in the harness of iniquity, and, putting forth all their strength, drew down upon themselves, with accelerated speed, the load of punishment which their sins deserved."  </p>
Coriander	<p>Heb. gad, ( Exodus 16:31 ;  Numbers 11:7 ), seed to which the manna is likened in its form and colour. It is the Coriandrum sativum of botanists, an umbelliferous annual plant with a round stalk, about two feet high. It is widely cultivated in Eastern countries and in the south of Europe for the sake of its seeds, which are in the form of a little ball of the size of a peppercorn. They are used medicinally and as a spice. The Greek name of this plant is korion or koriannon, whence the name "coriander."  </p>
Corinth	<p>a Grecian city, on the isthmus which joins the Peloponnesus to the mainland of Greece. It is about 48 miles west of Athens. The ancient city was destroyed by the Romans (B.C. 146), and that mentioned in the New Testament was quite a new city, having been rebuilt about a century afterwards and peopled by a colony of freedmen from Rome. It became under the Romans the seat of government for Southern Greece or Achaia ( Acts 18:12-16 ). It was noted for its wealth, and for the luxurious and immoral and vicious habits of the people. It had a large mixed population of Romans, Greeks, and Jews. When Paul first visited the city (A.D. 51 or 52), Gallio, the brother of Seneca, was proconsul. Here Paul resided for eighteen months ( 18:1-18 ). Here he first became aquainted with Aquila and Priscilla, and soon after his departure Apollos came to it from Ephesus. After an interval he visited it a second time, and remained for three months ( 20:3 ). During this second visit his Epistle to the Romans was written (probably A.D. 55). Although there were many Jewish converts at Corinth, yet the Gentile element prevailed in the church there.  </p><p> Some have argued from  2 Corinthians 12:14 ;  13:1 , that Paul visited Corinth a third time (i.e., that on some unrecorded occasion he visited the city between what are usually called the first and second visits). But the passages referred to only indicate Paul's intention to visit Corinth (Compare  1 Corinthians 16:5 , where the Greek present tense denotes an intention), an intention which was in some way frustrated. We can hardly suppose that such a visit could have been made by the apostle without more distinct reference to it.  </p>
Corinthians, First Epistle to the	<p>was written from Ephesus ( 1 Corinthians 16:8 ) about the time of the Passover in the third year of the apostle's sojourn there ( Acts 19:10 ;  20:31 ), and when he had formed the purpose to visit Macedonia, and then return to Corinth (probably A.D. 57).  </p><p> The news which had reached him, however, from Corinth frustrated his plan. He had heard of the abuses and contentions that had arisen among them, first from Apollos ( Acts 19:1 ), and then from a letter they had written him on the subject, and also from some of the "household of Chloe," and from Stephanas and his two friends who had visited him ( 1 Corinthians 1:11 ;  16:17 ). Paul thereupon wrote this letter, for the purpose of checking the factious spirit and correcting the erroneous opinions that had sprung up among them, and remedying the many abuses and disorderly practices that prevailed. Titus and a brother whose name is not given were probably the bearers of the letter ( 2 Corinthians 2:13 ;  2 Corinthians 8:6 2 Corinthians 8:16-18 ).  </p><p> The epistle may be divided into four parts: </p><li> The apostle deals with the subject of the lamentable divisions and party strifes that had arisen among them (1co. 1-4).  </li><li> He next treats of certain cases of immorality that had become notorious among them. They had apparently set at nought the very first principles of morality (5; 6).  </li><li> In the third part he discusses various questions of doctrine and of Christian ethics in reply to certain communications they had made to him. He especially rectifies certain flagrant abuses regarding the celebration of the Lord's supper (7-14).  </li><li> The concluding part (15; 16) contains an elaborate defense of the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, which had been called in question by some among them, followed by some general instructions, intimations, and greetings.  <p> This epistle "shows the powerful self-control of the apostle in spite of his physical weakness, his distressed circumstances, his incessant troubles, and his emotional nature. It was written, he tells us, in bitter anguish, 'out of much affliction and pressure of heart...and with streaming eyes' ( 2 Corinthians 2:4 ); yet he restrained the expression of his feelings, and wrote with a dignity and holy calm which he thought most calculated to win back his erring children. It gives a vivid picture of the early church...It entirely dissipates the dream that the apostolic church was in an exceptional condition of holiness of life or purity of doctrine." The apostle in this epistle unfolds and applies great principles fitted to guide the church of all ages in dealing with the same and kindred evils in whatever form they may appear.  </p><p> This is one of the epistles the authenticity of which has never been called in question by critics of any school, so many and so conclusive are the evidences of its Pauline origin. </p><p> The subscription to this epistle states erroneously in the Authorized Version that it was written at Philippi. This error arose from a mistranslation of  1 Corinthians 16:5 , "For I do pass through Macedonia," which was interpreted as meaning, "I am passing through Macedonia." In  16:8  he declares his intention of remaining some time longer in Ephesus. After that, his purpose is to "pass through Macedonia."  </p> </li>
Corinthians, Second Epistle to the	<p>Shortly after writing his first letter to the Corinthians, Paul left Ephesus, where intense excitement had been aroused against him, the evidence of his great success, and proceeded to Macedonia. Pursuing the usual route, he reached Troas, the port of departure for Europe. Here he expected to meet with Titus, whom he had sent from Ephesus to Corinth, with tidings of the effects produced on the church there by the first epistle; but was disappointed ( 1 Corinthians 16:9 ;  2 co  1:8 ;  1 Corinthians 2:12 1 Corinthians 2:13 ). He then left Troas and proceeded to Macedonia; and at Philippi, where he tarried, he was soon joined by Titus ( 2 Corinthians 7:6 2 Corinthians 7:7 ), who brought him good news from Corinth, and also by Timothy. Under the influence of the feelings awakened in his mind by the favourable report which Titus brought back from Corinth, this second epistle was written. It was probably written at Philippi, or, as some think, Thessalonica, early in the year A.D. 58, and was sent to Corinth by Titus. This letter he addresses not only to the church in Corinth, but also to the saints in all Achaia, i.e., in Athens, Cenchrea, and other cities in Greece.  </p><p> The contents of this epistle may be thus arranged: </p><li> Paul speaks of his spiritual labours and course of life, and expresses his warm affection toward the Corinthians (2co. 1-7).  </li><li> He gives specific directions regarding the collection that was to be made for their poor brethren in Judea (8; 9).  </li><li> He defends his own apostolic claim (10-13), and justifies himself from the charges and insinuations of the false teacher and his adherents.  <p> This epistle, it has been well said, shows the individuallity of the apostle more than any other. "Human weakness, spiritual strength, the deepest tenderness of affection, wounded feeling, sternness, irony, rebuke, impassioned self-vindication, humility, a just self-respect, zeal for the welfare of the weak and suffering, as well as for the progress of the church of Christ and for the spiritual advancement of its members, are all displayed in turn in the course of his appeal."--Lias, Second Corinthians. </p><p> Of the effects produced on the Corinthian church by this epistle we have no definite information. We know that Paul visited Corinth after he had written it ( Acts 20:2 Acts 20:3 ), and that on that occasion he tarried there for three months. In his letter to Rome, written at this time, he sent salutations from some of the principal members of the church to the Romans.  </p> </li>
Cormorant	<p>( Leviticus 11:17 ;  Deuteronomy 14:17 ), Heb. shalak, "plunging," or "darting down," (the Phalacrocorax carbo), ranked among the "unclean" birds; of the same family group as the pelican. It is a "plunging" bird, and is common on the coasts and the island seas of Palestine. Some think the Hebrew word should be rendered "gannet" (Sula bassana, "the solan goose"); others that it is the "tern" or "sea swallow," which also frequents the coasts of Palestine as well as the Sea of Galilee and the Jordan valley during several months of the year. But there is no reason to depart from the ordinary rendering.  </p><p> In  Isaiah 34:11 ,  Zephaniah 2:14  (but in RSV, "pelican") the Hebrew word rendered by this name is <i> ka'ath</i> . It is translated "pelican" (q.v.) in  Psalms 102:6 . The word literally means the "vomiter," and the pelican is so called from its vomiting the shells and other things which it has voraciously swallowed. (See PELICAN .) </p>
Corn	<p>The word so rendered (dagan) in  Genesis 27:28 Genesis 27:37 ,  Numbers 18:27 ,  Deuteronomy 28:51 ,  Lamentations 2:12 , is a general term representing all the commodities we usually describe by the words corn, grain, seeds, peas, beans. With this corresponds the use of the word in  John 12:24 .  </p><p> In  Genesis 41:35 Genesis 41:49 ,  Proverbs 11:26 ,  Joel 2:24  ("wheat"), the word thus translated (bar; i.e., "winnowed") means corn purified from chaff. With this corresponds the use of the word in the New Testament ( Matthew 3:12 ;  Luke 3:17 ;  Acts 7:12 ). In  Psalms 65:13  it means "growing corn."  </p><p> In  Genesis 42:1 Genesis 42:2 Genesis 42:19 ,  Joshua 9:14 ,  Nehemiah 10:31  ("victuals"), the word (sheber; i.e., "broken," i.e., grist) denotes generally victuals, provisions, and corn as a principal article of food.  </p><p> From the time of Solomon, corn began to be exported from Palestine ( Ezekiel 27:17 ;  Amos 8:5 ). "Plenty of corn" was a part of Issac's blessing conferred upon Jacob ( Genesis 27:28 ; Compare  Psalms 65:13 ).  </p>
Cornelius	<p>a centurion whose history is narrated in  Acts 10 . He was a "devout man," and like the centurion of Capernaum, believed in the God of Israel. His residence at Caesrea probably brought him into contact with Jews who communicated to him their expectations regarding the Messiah; and thus he was prepared to welcome the message Peter brought him. He became the first fruit of the Gentile world to Christ. He and his family were baptized and admitted into the Christian church ( Acts 10:1 Acts 10:44-48 ). (See CENTURION .) </p>
Corner	<p>The angle of a house ( Job 1:19 ) or a street ( Proverbs 7:8 ). "Corners" in  Nehemiah 9:22  denotes the various districts of the promised land allotted to the Israelites. In  Numbers 24:17 , the "corners of Moab" denotes the whole land of Moab. The "corner of a field" ( Leviticus 19:9 ;  23:22 ) is its extreme part, which was not to be reaped. The Jews were prohibited from cutting the "corners," i.e., the extremities, of the hair and whiskers running round the ears ( Leviticus 19:27 ;  21:5 ). The "four corners of the earth" in  Isaiah 11:12  and  Ezekiel 7:2  denotes the whole land. The "corners of the streets" mentioned in  Matthew 6:5  means the angles where streets meet so as to form a square or place of public resort.  </p><p> The corner gate of Jerusalem ( 2 Kings 14:13 ;  2 Chr  <span class="badLink">26:9</span> ) was on the north-west side of the city.  </p><p> Corner-stone ( Job 38:6 ;  Isaiah 28:16 ), a block of great importance in binding together the sides of a building. The "head of the corner" ( Psalms 118:22 Psalms 118:23 ) denotes the coping, the "coign of vantage", i.e., the topstone of a building. But the word "corner stone" is sometimes used to denote some person of rank and importance ( Isaiah 28:16 ). It is applied to our Lord, who was set in highest honour ( Matthew 21:42 ). He is also styled "the chief corner stone" ( Ephesians 2:20 ;  1 Peter 2:6-8 ). When ( Zechariah 10:4 ), speaking of Judah, says, "Out of him came forth the corner," he is probably to be understood as ultimately referring to the Messiah as the "corner stone." (See TEMPLE, SOLOMON'S.)  </p>
Cornet	<p>Heb. shophar, "brightness," with reference to the clearness of its sound ( 1 Chronicles 15:28 ;  2 Chr  15:14 ;  Psalms 98:6 ;  Hosea 5:8 ). It is usually rendered in the Authorized Version "trumpet." It denotes the long and straight horn, about eighteen inches long. The words of Joel, "Blow the trumpet," literally, "Sound the cornet," refer to the festival which was the preparation for the day of Atonement. In  Daniel 3:5 Daniel 3:7 Daniel 3:10 Daniel 3:15 , the word (keren) so rendered is a curved horn. The word "cornet" in  2 Samuel 6:5  (Heb. mena'an'im, occurring only here) was some kind of instrument played by being shaken like the Egyptian sistrum, consisting of rings or bells hung loosely on iron rods.  </p>
Cotes	<p>pens or enclosures for flocks ( 2 Chronicles 32:28 , "cotes for flocks;" RSV, "flocks in folds").  </p>
Cottage	<p></p><li> A booth in a vineyard ( Isaiah 1:8 ); a temporary shed covered with leaves or straw to shelter the watchman that kept the garden. These were slight fabrics, and were removed when no longer needed, or were left to be blown down in winter ( Job 27:18 ).  </li><li> A lodging-place (rendered "lodge" in  Isaiah 1:8 ); a slighter structure than the "booth," as the cucumber patch is more temporary than a vineyard ( Isaiah 24:20 ). It denotes a frail structure of boughs supported on a few poles, which is still in use in the East, or a hammock suspended between trees, in which the watchman was accustomed to sleep during summer.  </li><li> In  Zephaniah 2:6  it is the rendering of the Hebrew <i> keroth</i> , which some suppose to denote rather "pits" (RSV marg., "caves") or "wells of water," such as shepherds would sink.  </li>
Couch	<p>( Genesis 49:4 ;  1 Chronicles 5:1 ;  Job 7:13 ;  Psalms 6:6 , etc.), a seat for repose or rest. (See BED .) </p>
Coulter	<p>( 1 Samuel 13:20 1 Samuel 13:21 ), an agricultural instrument, elsewhere called "ploughshare" ( Isaiah 2:4 ;  Micah 4:3 ;  Joel 3:10 ). It was the facing-piece of a plough, analogous to the modern coulter.  </p>
Council	<p>spoken of counsellors who sat in public trials with the governor of a province ( Acts 25:12 ).  </p><p> The Jewish councils were the Sanhedrim, or supreme council of the nation, which had subordinate to it smaller tribunals (the "judgment," perhaps, in  Matthew 5:21 Matthew 5:22 ) in the cities of Palestine ( Matthew 10:17 ;  Mark 13:9 ). In the time of Christ the functions of the Sanhedrim were limited ( John 16:2 ;  2 co.  11:24 ). In  Psalms 68:27  the word "council" means simply a company of persons. (RSV marg., "company.")  </p><p> In ecclesiastical history the word is used to denote an assembly of pastors or bishops for the discussion and regulation of church affairs. The first of these councils was that of the apostles and elders at Jerusalem, of which we have a detailed account in  Acts 15 .  </p>
Counsellor	<p>an adviser ( Proverbs 11:14 ;  15:22 ), a king's state counsellor ( 2 Samuel 15:12 ). Used once of the Messiah ( Isaiah 9:6 ). In  Mark 15:43 ,  Luke 23:50 , the word probably means a member of the Jewish Sanhedrim.  </p>
Courses	<p>When David was not permitted to build the temple, he proceeded, among the last acts of his life, with the assistance of Zadok and Ahimelech, to organize the priestly and musical services to be conducted in the house of God. </p><li> He divided the priests into twenty-four courses ( 1 Chronicles 24:1-19 ), sixteen being of the house of Eleazar and eight of that of Ithamar. Each course was under a head or chief, and ministered for a week, the order being determined by lot. </li><li> The rest of the 38,000 Levites ( 23:4 ) were divided also into twenty-four courses, each to render some allotted service in public worship: 4,000 in twenty-four courses were set apart as singers and musicians under separate leaders (25); 4,000 as porters or keepers of the doors and gates of the sanctuary ( 26:1-19 ); and 6,000 as officers and judges to see to the administration of the law in all civil and ecclesiastical matters (20-32).  <p> This arrangement was re-established by Hezekiah ( 2 Chronicles 31:2 ); and afterwards the four sacerdotal courses which are said to have returned from the Captivity were re-divided into the original number of twenty-four by ( Ezra 6:18 ).  </p> </li>
Court	<p>the enclosure of the tabernacle ( Exodus 27:9-19 ;  40:8 ), of the temple ( 1 Kings 6:36 ), of a prison ( Nehemiah 3:25 ), of a private house ( 2 Samuel 17:18 ), and of a king's palace ( 2 Kings 20:4 ).  </p>
Covenant	<p>a contract or agreement between two parties. In the Old Testament the Hebrew word <i> berith</i> is always thus translated. <i> Berith</i> is derived from a root which means "to cut," and hence a covenant is a "cutting," with reference to the cutting or dividing of animals into two parts, and the contracting parties passing between them, in making a covenant ( Genesis 15 ;  Jeremiah 34:18 Jeremiah 34:19 ).  </p><p> The corresponding word in the New Testament Greek is <i> diatheke</i> , which is, however, rendered "testament" generally in the Authorized Version. It ought to be rendered, just as the word <i> berith</i> of the Old Testament, "covenant." </p><p> This word is used (1) of a covenant or compact between man and man ( Genesis 21:32 ), or between tribes or nations ( 1 Samuel 11:1 ;  Joshua 9:6 Joshua 9:15 ). In entering into a convenant, Jehovah was solemnly called on to witness the transaction ( Genesis 31:50 ), and hence it was called a "covenant of the Lord" ( 1 Samuel 20:8 ). The marriage compact is called "the covenant of God" ( Proverbs 2:17 ), because the marriage was made in God's name. Wicked men are spoken of as acting as if they had made a "covenant with death" not to destroy them, or with hell not to devour them ( Isaiah 28:15 Isaiah 28:18 ).  </p><li> The word is used with reference to God's revelation of himself in the way of promise or of favour to men. Thus God's promise to Noah after the Flood is called a covenant ( Genesis 9 ;  Jeremiah 33:20 , "my covenant"). We have an account of God's covernant with Abraham ( Genesis 17 , Compare  Leviticus 26:42 ), of the covenant of the priesthood ( Numbers 25:12 Numbers 25:13 ;  Deuteronomy 33:9 ;  Nehemiah 13:29 ), and of the covenant of Sinai ( Exodus 34:27 Exodus 34:28 ;  Leviticus 26:15 ), which was afterwards renewed at different times in the history of Israel ( Deuteronomy 29 ;  Joshua 1:24 ;  2 Chr.  15 ;  23 ;  <span class="badLink">29</span> ;  <span class="badLink">34</span> ;  Ezra 10 ;  Nehemiah 9 ). In conformity with human custom, God's covenant is said to be confirmed with an oath ( Deuteronomy 4:31 ;  Psalms 89:3 ), and to be accompanied by a sign ( Genesis 9 ;  17 ). Hence the covenant is called God's "counsel," "oath," "promise" ( Psalms 89:3 Psalms 89:4 ;  105:8-11 ;  Hebrews 6:13-20 ;  Luke 1:68-75 ). God's covenant consists wholly in the bestowal of blessing ( Isaiah 59:21 ;  Jeremiah 31:33 Jeremiah 31:34 ).  <p> The term covenant is also used to designate the regular succession of day and night ( Jeremiah 33:20 ), the Sabbath ( Exodus 31:16 ), circumcision ( Genesis 17:9 Genesis 17:10 ), and in general any ordinance of God ( Jeremiah 34:13 Jeremiah 34:14 ).  </p><p> A "covenant of salt" signifies an everlasting covenant, in the sealing or ratifying of which salt, as an emblem of perpetuity, is used ( Numbers 18:19 ;  Leviticus 2:13 ;  2 Chr  13:5 ).  </p><p> COVENANT OF WORKS, the constitution under which Adam was placed at his creation. In this covenant, </p></li><li> The contracting parties were (a) God the moral Governor, and (b) Adam, a free moral agent, and representative of all his natural posterity ( Romans 5:12-19 ). </li><li> The promise was "life" ( Matthew 19:16 Matthew 19:17 ;  Galatians 3:12 ). </li><li> The condition was perfect obedience to the law, the test in this case being abstaining from eating the fruit of the "tree of knowledge," etc. </li><li> The penalty was death ( Genesis 2:16 Genesis 2:17 ).  <p> This covenant is also called a covenant of nature, as made with man in his natural or unfallen state; a covenant of life, because "life" was the promise attached to obedience; and a legal covenant, because it demanded perfect obedience to the law. </p><p> The "tree of life" was the outward sign and seal of that life which was promised in the covenant, and hence it is usually called the seal of that covenant. </p><p> This covenant is abrogated under the gospel, inasmuch as Christ has fulfilled all its conditions in behalf of his people, and now offers salvation on the condition of faith. It is still in force, however, as it rests on the immutable justice of God, and is binding on all who have not fled to Christ and accepted his righteousness. </p><p> CONVENANT OF GRACE, the eternal plan of redemption entered into by the three persons of the Godhead, and carried out by them in its several parts. In it the Father represented the Godhead in its indivisible sovereignty, and the Son his people as their surety ( John 17:4 John 17:6 John 17:9 ;  Isaiah 42:6 ;  Psalms 89:3 ).  </p><p> The conditions of this covenant were, </p></li><li> On the part of the Father (a) all needful preparation to the Son for the accomplishment of his work ( Hebrews 10:5 ;  Isaiah 42:1-7 ); (b) support in the work ( Luke 22:43 ); and (c) a glorious reward in the exaltation of Christ when his work was done (Phil  2:6-11 ), his investiture with universal dominion ( John 5:22 ;  Psalms 110:1 ), his having the administration of the covenant committed into his hands ( Matthew 28:18 ;  John 1:12 ;  17:2 ;  Acts 2:33 ), and in the final salvation of all his people ( Isaiah 35:10 ;  Isaiah 53:10 Isaiah 53:11 ;  Jeremiah 31:33 ;  Titus 1:2 ). </li><li> On the part of the Son the conditions were (a) his becoming incarnate ( Galatians 4:4 Galatians 4:5 ); and (b) as the second Adam his representing all his people, assuming their place and undertaking all their obligations under the violated covenant of works; (c) obeying the law ( Psalms 40:8 ;  Isaiah 42:21 ;  John 9:4 John 9:5 ), and (d) suffering its penalty ( Isaiah 53 ;  2 co.  5:21 ;  Galatians 3:13 ), in their stead.  <p> Christ, the mediator of, fulfils all its conditions in behalf of his people, and dispenses to them all its blessings. In  Hebrews 8:6 ;  9:15 ;  12:24 , this title is given to Christ. (See DISPENSATION .) </p> </li>
Covering of the eyes	<p>occurs only in  Genesis 20:16 . In the Revised Version the rendering is "it (i.e., Abimelech's present of 1,000 pieces of silver to Abraham) is for thee a covering of the eyes." This has been regarded as an implied advice to Sarah to conform to the custom of married women, and wear a complete veil, covering the eyes as well as the rest of the face.  </p>
Covetousness	<p>a strong desire after the possession of worldly things ( Colossians 3:5 ;  Ephesians 5:5 ;  Hebrews 13:5 ;  1 Timothy 6:9 1 Timothy 6:10 ;  Matthew 6:20 ). It assumes sometimes the more aggravated form of avarice, which is the mark of cold-hearted worldliness.  </p>
Cow	<p>A cow and her calf were not to be killed on the same day ( Leviticus 22:28 ;  Exodus 23:19 ;  Deuteronomy 22:6 Deuteronomy 22:7 ). The reason for this enactment is not given. A state of great poverty is described in the words of  Isaiah 7:21-25 , where, instead of possessing great resources, a man shall depend for the subsistence of himself and his family on what a single cow and two sheep could yield.  </p>
Crane	<p>( Isaiah 38:14 ;  Jeremiah 8:7 ). In both of these passages the Authorized Version has reversed the Hebrew order of the words. "Crane or swallow" should be "swallow or crane," as in the Revised Version. The rendering is there correct. The Hebrew for crane is <i> 'agur</i> , the Grus cincerea, a bird well known in Palestine. It is migratory, and is distinguished by its loud voice, its cry being hoarse and melancholy. </p>
Creation	<p>"In the beginning" God created, i.e., called into being, all things out of nothing. This creative act on the part of God was absolutely free, and for infinitely wise reasons. The cause of all things exists only in the will of God. The work of creation is attributed (1) to the Godhead ( Genesis 1:1 Genesis 1:26 ); (2) to the Father ( 1 Corinthians 8:6 ); (3) to the Son ( John 1:3 ;  Colossians 1:16 Colossians 1:17 ); (4) to the Holy Spirit ( Genesis 1:2 ;  Job 26:13 ;  Psalms 104:30 ). The fact that he is the Creator distinguishes Jehovah as the true God ( Isaiah 37:16 ;  Isaiah 40:12 Isaiah 40:13 ;  54:5 ;  Psalms 96:5 ;  Jeremiah 10:11 Jeremiah 10:12 ). The one great end in the work of creation is the manifestation of the glory of the Creator ( Colossians 1:16 ;  Revelation 4:11 ;  Romans 11:36 ). God's works, equally with God's word, are a revelation from him; and between the teachings of the one and those of the other, when rightly understood, there can be no contradiction.  </p><p> Traditions of the creation, disfigured by corruptions, are found among the records of ancient Eastern nations. (See ACCAD .) A peculiar interest belongs to the traditions of the Accadians, the primitive inhabitants of the plains of Lower Mesopotamia. These within the last few years have been brought to light in the tablets and cylinders which have been rescued from the long-buried palaces and temples of Assyria. They bear a remarkable resemblance to the record of Genesis. </p>
Creature	<p>denotes the whole creation in  Romans 8:39 ;  Colossians 1:15 ;  Revelation 5:13 ; the whole human race in  Mark 16:15 ;  Romans 8:19-22 .  </p><p> The living creatures in  Ezekiel 10:15 Ezekiel 10:17 , are imaginary beings, symbols of the Divine attributes and operations.  </p>
Crescens	<p>increasing, probably one of the seventy disciples of Christ. He was one of Paul's assistants ( 2 Timothy 4:10 ), probably a Christian of Rome.  </p>
Crete	<p>now called Candia, one of the largest islands in the Meditterranean, about 140 miles long and 35 broad. It was at one time a very prosperous and populous island, having a "hundred cities." The character of the people is described in Paul's quotation from "one of their own poets" (Epimenides) in his epistle to Titus: "The Cretans are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies" ( Titus 1:12 ). Jews from Crete were in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost ( Acts 2:11 ). The island was visited by Paul on his voyage to Rome ( Acts 27 ). Here Paul subsequently left ( Titus 1:5 ) "to ordain elders." Some have supposed that it was the original home of the Caphtorim (q.v.) or Philistines.  </p>
Crimson	<p>See COLOUR . </p>
Crisping-pin	<p>( Isaiah 3:22 ; RSV, "satchel"), some kind of female ornament, probably like the modern reticule. The Hebrew word <i> harit</i> properly signifies pouch or casket or purse. It is rendered "bag" in  2 Kings 5:23 .  </p>
Crispus	<p>curled, the chief of the synagogue at Corinth ( Acts 18:8 ). He was converted and, with his family, baptized by Paul ( 1 Corinthians 1:14 ).  </p>
Cross	<p>in the New Testament the instrument of crucifixion, and hence used for the crucifixion of Christ itself ( Ephesians 2:16 ;  Hebrews 12:2 ;  1 Corinthians 1:17 1 Corinthians 1:18 ;  Galatians 5:11 ;  Galatians 6:12 Galatians 6:14 ; Phil  3:18 ). The word is also used to denote any severe affliction or trial ( Matthew 10:38 ;  16:24 ;  Mark 8:34 ;  10:21 ).  </p><p> The forms in which the cross is represented are these: </p><p> 1. The crux simplex (I), a "single piece without transom."  </p><p> 2. The crux decussata (X), or St. Andrew's cross.  </p><p> 3. The crux commissa (T), or St. Anthony's cross.  </p><p> 4. The crux immissa (t), or Latin cross, which was the kind of cross on which our Saviour died. Above our Lord's head, on the projecting beam, was placed the "title." (See CRUCIFIXION .) </p><p> After the conversion, so-called, of Constantine the Great (B.C. 313), the cross first came into use as an emblem of Christianity. He pretended at a critical moment that he saw a flaming cross in the heavens bearing the inscription, "In hoc signo vinces", i.e., By this sign thou shalt conquer, and that on the following night Christ himself appeared and ordered him to take for his standard the sign of this cross. In this form a new standard, called the Labarum, was accordingly made, and borne by the Roman armies. It remained the standard of the Roman army till the downfall of the Western empire. It bore the embroidered monogram of Christ, i.e., the first two Greek letters of his name, X and P (chi and rho), with the Alpha and Omega. (See A .) </p>
Crown	<p></p><li> Denotes the plate of gold in the front of the high priest's mitre ( Exodus 29:6 ;  39:30 ). The same Hebrew word so rendered (ne'zer) denotes the diadem worn by Saul in battle ( 2 Samuel 1:10 ), and also that which was used at the coronation of Joash ( 2 Kings 11:12 ).  </li><li> The more general name in Hebrew for a crown is <i> 'atarah</i> , meaning a "circlet." This is used of crowns and head ornaments of divers kinds, including royal crowns. Such was the crown taken from the king of Ammon by David ( 2 Samuel 12:30 ). The crown worn by the Assyrian kings was a high mitre, sometimes adorned with flowers. There are sculptures also representing the crowns worn by the early Egyptian and Persian kings. Sometimes a diadem surrounded the royal head-dress of two or three fillets. This probably signified that the wearer had dominion over two or three countries. In  Revelation 12:3 ;  13:1 , we read of "many crowns," a token of extended dominion.  </li><li> The ancient Persian crown ( Esther 1:11 ;  2:17 ;  6:8 ) was called <i> kether</i> ; i.e., "a chaplet," a high cap or tiara. Crowns were worn sometimes to represent honour and power ( Ezekiel 23:42 ). They were worn at marriages (Cant  3:11 ;  Isaiah 61:10 , "ornaments;" RSV, "a garland"), and at feasts and public festivals.  <p> The crown was among the Romans and Greeks a symbol of victory and reward. The crown or wreath worn by the victors in the Olympic games was made of leaves of the wild olive; in the Pythian games, of laurel; in the Nemean games, of parsley; and in the Isthmian games, of the pine. The Romans bestowed the "civic crown" on him who saved the life of a citizen. It was made of the leaves of the oak. In opposition to all these fading crowns the apostles speak of the incorruptible crown, the crown of life ( James 1:12 ;  Revelation 2:10 ) "that fadeth not away" ( 1 Peter 5:4 , Gr. amarantinos; comp  1:4 ). Probably the word "amaranth" was applied to flowers we call "everlasting," the "immortal amaranth."  </p> </li>
Crown of thorns	<p>our Lord was crowned with a, in mockery by the Romans ( Matthew 27:29 ). The object of Pilate's guard in doing this was probably to insult, and not specially to inflict pain. There is nothing to show that the shrub thus used was, as has been supposed, the spina Christi, which could have been easily woven into a wreath. It was probably the thorny nabk, which grew abundantly round about Jerusalem, and whose flexible, pliant, and round branches could easily be platted into the form of a crown. (See THORN,3.)  </p>
Crucifixion	<p>a common mode of punishment among heathen nations in early times. It is not certain whether it was known among the ancient Jews; probably it was not. The modes of capital punishment according to the Mosaic law were, by the sword ( Exodus 21 ), strangling, fire ( Leviticus 20 ), and stoning ( Deuteronomy 21 ).  </p><p> This was regarded as the most horrible form of death, and to a Jew it would acquire greater horror from the curse in  Deuteronomy 21:23 .  </p><p> This punishment began by subjecting the sufferer to scourging. In the case of our Lord, however, his scourging was rather before the sentence was passed upon him, and was inflicted by Pilate for the purpose, probably, of exciting pity and procuring his escape from further punishment ( Luke 23:22 ;  John 19:1 ).  </p><p> The condemned one carried his own cross to the place of execution, which was outside the city, in some conspicuous place set apart for the purpose. Before the nailing to the cross took place, a medicated cup of vinegar mixed with gall and myrrh (the sopor) was given, for the purpose of deadening the pangs of the sufferer. Our Lord refused this cup, that his senses might be clear ( Matthew 27:34 ). The spongeful of vinegar, sour wine, posca, the common drink of the Roman soldiers, which was put on a hyssop stalk and offered to our Lord in contemptuous pity ( Matthew 27:48 ;  Luke 23:36 ), he tasted to allay the agonies of his thirst ( John 19:29 ). The accounts given of the crucifixion of our Lord are in entire agreement with the customs and practices of the Roman in such cases. He was crucified between two "malefactors" ( Isaiah 53:12 ;  Luke 23:32 ), and was watched by a party of four soldiers ( John 19:23 ;  Matthew 27:36 Matthew 27:54 ), with their centurion. The "breaking of the legs" of the malefactors was intended to hasten death, and put them out of misery ( John 19:31 ); but the unusual rapidity of our Lord's death ( 19:33 ) was due to his previous sufferings and his great mental anguish. The omission of the breaking of his legs was the fulfilment of a type ( Exodus 12:46 ). He literally died of a broken heart, a ruptured heart, and hence the flowing of blood and water from the wound made by the soldier's spear ( John 19:34 ). Our Lord uttered seven memorable words from the cross, namely, (1)  Luke 23:34 ; (2)  23:43 ; (3)  John 19:26 ; (4)  Matthew 27:46 ,  Mark 15:34 ; (5)  John 19:28 ;  John 19:30 ; (7)  Luke 23:46 .  </p>
Cruse	<p>a utensil; a flask or cup for holding water ( 1 Samuel 26:11 1 Samuel 26:12 1 Samuel 26:16 ;  1 Kings 19:6 ) or oil ( 1 Kings 17:12 1 Kings 17:14 1 Kings 17:16 ). In  1 Kings 14:3  the word there so rendered means properly a bottle, as in  Jeremiah 19:1 Jeremiah 19:10 , or pitcher. In  2 Kings 2:20 , a platter or flat metal saucer is intended. The Hebrew word here used is translated "dish" in  21:13 ; "pans," in  2 Chronicles 35:13 ; and "bosom," in  Proverbs 19:24 ;  26:15  (RSV, "dish").  </p>
Crystal	<p>( Ezekiel 1:22 , with the epithet "terrible," as dazzling the spectators with its brightness). The word occurs in  Revelation 4:6 ;  21:11 ;  22:1 . It is a stone of the flint order, the most refined kind of quartz. The Greek word here used means also literally "ice." The ancients regarded the crystal as only pure water congealed into extreme hardness by great length of time.  </p>
Cubit	<p>Heb. 'ammah; i.e., "mother of the arm," the fore-arm, is a word derived from the Latin cubitus, the lower arm. It is difficult to determine the exact length of this measure, from the uncertainty whether it included the entire length from the elbow to the tip of the longest finger, or only from the elbow to the root of the hand at the wrist. The probability is that the longer was the original cubit. The common computation as to the length of the cubit makes it 20.24 inches for the ordinary cubit, and 21.888 inches for the sacred one. This is the same as the Egyptian measurements.  </p><p> A rod or staff the measure of a cubit is called in  Judges 3:16 <i> gomed</i> , which literally means a "cut," something "cut off." The LXX. and Vulgate render it "span." </p>
Cuckoo	<p>(Heb. shahaph), from a root meaning "to be lean; slender." This bird is mentioned only in  Leviticus 11:16  and  Deuteronomy 14:15  (RSV, "seamew"). Some have interpreted the Hebrew word by "petrel" or "shearwater" (Puffinus cinereus), which is found on the coast of Syria; others think it denotes the "sea-gull" or "seamew." The common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) feeds on reptiles and large insects. It is found in Asia and Africa as well as in Europe. It only passes the winter in Palestine. The Arabs suppose it to utter the cry <i> Yakub_, and hence they call it _tir el-Yakub</i> ; i.e., "Jacob's bird." </p>
Cucumbers	<p>(Heb. plur. kishshuim; i.e., "hard," "difficult" of digestion, only in  Numbers 11:5 ). This vegetable is extensively cultivated in the East at the present day, as it appears to have been in earlier times among the Hebrews. It belongs to the gourd family of plants. In the East its cooling pulp and juice are most refreshing. "We need not altogether wonder that the Israelites, wearily marching through the arid solitudes of the Sinaitic peninsula, thought more of the cucumbers and watermelons of which they had had no lack in Egypt, rather than of the cruel bondage which was the price of these luxuries." Groser's Scripture Natural History.  </p><p> Isaiah speaks of a "lodge" ( 1:8 ; Heb. sukkah), i.e., a shed or edifice more solid than a booth, for the protection throughout the season from spring to autumn of the watchers in a "garden of cucumbers."  </p>
Cummin	<p>(Heb. kammon; i.e., a "condiment"), the fruit or seed of an umbelliferous plant, the Cuminum sativum, still extensively cultivated in the East. Its fruit is mentioned in  Isaiah 28:25 Isaiah 28:27 . In the New Testament it is mentioned in  Matthew 23:23 , where our Lord pronounces a "woe" on the scribes and Pharisees, who were zealous in paying tithes of "mint and anise and cummin," while they omitted the weightier matters of the law." "It is used as a spice, both bruised, to mix with bread, and also boiled, in the various messes and stews which compose an Oriental banquet." Tristram, Natural History.  </p>
Cup	<p>a wine-cup ( Genesis 40:11 Genesis 40:21 ), various forms of which are found on Assyrian and Egyptian monuments. All Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold ( 1 Kings 10: :  21 ). The cups mentioned in the New Testament were made after Roman and Greek models, and were sometimes of gold ( Revelation 17:4 ).  </p><p> The art of divining by means of a cup was practiced in Egypt ( Genesis 44:2-17 ), and in the East generally.  </p><p> The "cup of salvation" ( Psalms 116:13 ) is the cup of thanksgiving for the great salvation. The "cup of consolation" ( Jeremiah 16:7 ) refers to the custom of friends sending viands and wine to console relatives in mourning ( Proverbs 31:6 ). In  1 Corinthians 10:16 , the "cup of blessing" is contrasted with the "cup of devils" ( 1 Corinthians 10:21 ). The sacramental cup is the "cup of blessing," because of blessing pronounced over it ( Matthew 26:27 ;  Luke 22:17 ). The "portion of the cup" ( Psalms 11:6 ;  16:5 ) denotes one's condition of life, prosperous or adverse. A "cup" is also a type of sensual allurement ( Jeremiah 51:7 ;  Proverbs 23:31 ;  Revelation 17:4 ). We read also of the "cup of astonishment," the "cup of trembling," and the "cup of God's wrath" ( Psalms 75:8 ;  Isaiah 51:17 ;  Jeremiah 25:15 ;  Lamentations 4:21 ;  Ezekiel 23:32 ;  Revelation 16:19 ; Compare  Matthew 26:39 Matthew 26:42 ;  John 18:11 ). The cup is also the symbol of death ( Matthew 16:28 ;  Mark 9:1 ;  Hebrews 2:9 ).  </p>
Cup-bearer	<p>an officer of high rank with Egyptian, Persian, Assyrian, and Jewish monarchs. The cup-bearer of the king of Egypt is mentioned in connection with Joseph's history ( Genesis 40:1-21 ;  41:9 ). Rabshakeh (q.v.) was cup-bearer in the Assyrian court ( 2 Kings 18:17 ). Nehemiah filled this office to the king of Persia ( Nehemiah 1:11 ). We read also of Solomon's cup-bearers ( 1 Kings 10:5 ;  2 Chr  9:4 ).  </p>
Curious arts	<p>( Acts 19:19 ), magical arts; jugglery practised by the Ephesian conjurers. Ephesus was noted for its wizard and the "Ephesian spells;" i.e., charms or scraps of parchment written over with certain formula, which were worn as a safeguard against all manner of evils. The more important and powerful of these charms were written out in books which circulated among the exorcists, and were sold at a great price.  </p>
Curse	<p>denounced by God against the serpent ( Genesis 3:14 ), and against Cain ( 4:11 ). These divine maledictions carried their effect with them. Prophetical curses were sometimes pronounced by holy men ( Genesis 9:25 ;  49:7 ;  Deuteronomy 27:15 ;  Joshua 6:26 ). Such curses are not the consequence of passion or revenge, they are predictions.  </p><p> No one on pain of death shall curse father or mother ( Exodus 21:17 ), nor the prince of his people ( 22:28 ), nor the deaf ( Leviticus 19:14 ). Cursing God or blaspheming was punishable by death ( Leviticus 24:10-16 ). The words "curse God and die" (RSV, "renounce God and die"), used by Job's wife ( Job 2:9 ), have been variously interpreted. Perhaps they simply mean that as nothing but death was expected, God would by this cursing at once interpose and destroy Job, and so put an end to his sufferings.  </p>
Curtain	<p></p><li> Ten curtains, each twenty-eight cubits long and four wide, made of fine linen, also eleven made of goat's hair, covered the tabernacle ( Exodus 26:1-13 ;  36:8-17 ).  </li><li> The sacred curtain, separating the holy of holies from the sanctuary, is designated by a different Hebrew word (peroketh). It is described as a "veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen of cunning work" ( Exodus 26:31 ;  Leviticus 16:2 ;  Numbers 18:7 ).  </li><li> "Stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain" ( Isaiah 40:22 ), is an expression used with reference to the veil or awning which Orientals spread for a screen over their courts in summer. According to the prophet, the heavens are spread over our heads as such an awning. Similar expressions are found in Ps 104:2l; Compare  Isaiah 44:24 ;  Job 9:8 .   </li>
Cush	<p>black. </p><li> A son, probably the eldest, of Ham, and the father of Nimrod ( Genesis 10:8 ;  1 Chronicles 1:10 ). From him the land of Cush seems to have derived its name. The question of the precise locality of the land of Cush has given rise to not a little controversy. The second river of Paradise surrounded the whole land of Cush ( Genesis 2:13 , RSV). The term Cush is in the Old Testament generally applied to the countries south of the Israelites. It was the southern limit of Egypt ( Ezekiel 29:10 , A.V. "Ethiopia," Heb. Cush), with which it is generally associated ( Psalms 68:31 ;  Isaiah 18:1 ;  Jeremiah 46:9 , etc.). It stands also associated with Elam ( Isaiah 11:11 ), with Persia (Ezek.  38:5 ), and with the Sabeans ( Isaiah 45:14 ). From these facts it has been inferred that Cush included Arabia and the country on the west coast of the Red Sea. Rawlinson takes it to be the country still known as Khuzi-stan, on the east side of the Lower Tigris. But there are intimations which warrant the conclusion that there was also a Cush in Africa, the Ethiopia (so called by the Greeks) of Africa. Ezekiel speaks ( 29:10 ; comp  30:4-6 ) of it as lying south of Egypt. It was the country now known to us as Nubia and Abyssinia ( Isaiah 18:1 ;  Zephaniah 3:10 , Heb. Cush). In ancient Egyptian inscriptions Ethiopia is termed <i> Kesh</i> . The Cushites appear to have spread along extensive tracts, stretching from the Upper Nile to the Euphrates and Tigris. At an early period there was a stream of migration of Cushites "from Ethiopia, properly so called, through Arabia, Babylonia, and Persia, to Western India." The Hamite races, soon after their arrival in Africa, began to spread north, east, and west. Three branches of the Cushite or Ethiopian stock, moving from Western Asia, settled in the regions contiguous to the Persian Gulf. One branch, called the Cossaeans, settled in the mountainous district on the east of the Tigris, known afterwards as Susiana; another occupied the lower regions of the Euphrates and the Tigris; while a third colonized the southern shores and islands of the gulf, whence they afterwards emigrated to the Mediterranean and settled on the coast of Palestine as the Phoenicians. Nimrod was a great Cushite chief. He conquered the Accadians, a Tauranian race, already settled in Mesopotamia, and founded his kingdom, the Cushites mingling with the Accads, and so forming the Chaldean nation. </li><li> A Benjamite of this name is mentioned in the title of  Psalms 7 . "Cush was probably a follower of Saul, the head of his tribe, and had sought the friendship of David for the purpose of 'rewarding evil to him that was at peace with him.'"   </li>
Cushan	<p>probably a poetic or prolonged name of the land of Cush, the Arabian Cush ( Habakkuk 3:7 ). Some have, however, supposed this to be the same as Chushan-rishathaim ( Judges 3:8 Judges 3:10 ), i.e., taking the latter part of the name as a title or local appellation, Chushan "of the two iniquities" (= oppressing Israel, and provoking them to idolatry), a Mesopotamian king, identified by Rawlinson with Asshur-ris-ilim (the father of Tiglathpileser I.); but incorrectly, for the empire of Assyria was not yet founded. He held Israel in bondage for eight years.  </p>
Cushite	<p></p><li> The messenger sent by Joab to David to announce his victory over Absalom ( 2 Samuel 18:32 ).  </li><li> The father of Shelemiah ( Jeremiah 36:14 ).  </li><li> Son of Gedaliah, and father of the prophet ( Zephaniah 1:1 ).  </li><li> Moses married a Cushite woman ( Numbers 12:1 ). From this circumstance some have supposed that Zipporah was meant, and hence that Midian was Cush.   </li>
Custom	<p>a tax imposed by the Romans. The tax-gatherers were termed publicans (q.v.), who had their stations at the gates of cities, and in the public highways, and at the place set apart for that purpose, called the "receipt of custom" (Matt.9: 9;  Mark 2:14 ), where they collected the money that was to be paid on certain goods (Matt.17:25). These publicans were tempted to exact more from the people than was lawful, and were, in consequence of their extortions, objects of great hatred. The Pharisees would have no intercourse with them (Matt.5:46,47;  Mark 9:10 Mark 9:11 ).  </p><p> A tax or tribute (q.v.) of half a shekel was annually paid by every adult Jew for the temple. It had to be paid in Jewish coin ( Matthew 22:17-19 ;  Mark 12:14 Mark 12:15 ). Money-changers (q.v.) were necessary, to enable the Jews who came up to Jerusalem at the feasts to exchange their foreign coin for Jewish money; but as it was forbidden by the law to carry on such a traffic for emolument ( Deuteronomy 23:19 Deuteronomy 23:20 ), our Lord drove them from the temple ( Matthew 21:12 :  Mark 11:15 ).  </p>
Cuthah	<p>one of the Babylonian cities or districts from which Shalmaneser transplanted certain colonists to Samaria ( 2 Kings 17:24 ). Some have conjectured that the "Cutheans" were identical with the "Cossaeans" who inhabited the hill-country to the north of the river Choaspes. Cuthah is now identified with Tell Ibrahim, 15 miles north-east of Babylon.  </p>
Cutting	<p>the flesh in various ways was an idolatrous practice, a part of idol-worship ( Deuteronomy 14:1 ;  1 Kings 18:28 ). The Israelites were commanded not to imitate this practice ( Leviticus 19:28 ;  21:5 ;  Deuteronomy 14:1 ). The tearing of the flesh from grief and anguish of spirit in mourning for the dead was regarded as a mark of affection ( Jeremiah 16:6 ;  41:5 ;  48:37 ).  </p><p> Allusions are made in ( Revelation 13:16 ;  17:5 ;  19:20 ) to the practice of printing marks on the body, to indicate allegiance to a deity. We find also references to it, through in a different direction, by Paul ( Galatians 6 ;  7 ) and by ( Ezekiel 9:4 ). (See HAIR .) </p>
Cymbals	<p>(Heb. tzeltzelim, from a root meaning to "tinkle"), musical instruments, consisting of two convex pieces of brass one held in each hand, which were clashed together to produce a loud clanging sound; castanets; "loud cymbals." "Highsounding cymbals" consisted of two larger plates, one held also in each hand ( 2 Samuel 6:5 ;  Psalms 150:5 ;  1 Chronicles 13:8 ;  1 Chronicles 15:16 1 Chronicles 15:19 1 Chronicles 15:28 ;  1 Corinthians 13:1 ).  </p>
Cypress	<p>(Heb. tirzah, "hardness"), mentioned only in  Isaiah 44:14  (RSV, "holm tree"). The oldest Latin version translates this word by ilex, i.e., the evergreen oak, which may possibly have been the tree intended; but there is great probability that our Authorized Version is correct in rendering it "cypress." This tree grows abundantly on the mountains of Hermon. Its wood is hard and fragrant, and very durable. Its foliage is dark and gloomy. It is an evergreen (Cupressus sempervirens). "Throughout the East it is used as a funereal tree; and its dark, tall, waving plumes render it peculiarly appropriate among the tombs."  </p>
Cyprus	<p>one of the largest islands of the Mediterranean, about 148 miles long and 40 broad. It is distant about 60 miles from the Syrian coast. It was the "Chittim" of the Old Testament ( Numbers 24:24 ). The Greek colonists gave it the name of Kypros, from the cyprus, i.e., the henna (see CAMPHIRE), which grew on this island. It was originally inhabited by Phoenicians. In B.C. 477 it fell under the dominion of the Greeks; and became a Roman province B.C. 58. In ancient times it was a centre of great commercial activity. Corn and wine and oil were produced here in the greatest perfection. It was rich also in timber and in mineral wealth.  </p><p> It is first mentioned in the New Testament ( Acts 4:36 ) as the native place of Barnabas. It was the scene of Paul's first missionary labours ( 13:4-13 ), when he and Barnabas and John Mark were sent forth by the church of Antioch. It was afterwards visited by Barnabas and Mark alone ( 15:39 ). Mnason, an "old disciple," probaly one of the converts of the day of Pentecost belonging to this island, is mentioned ( 21:16 ). It is also mentioned in connection with the voyages of Paul ( Acts 21:3 ;  27:4 ). After being under the Turks for three hundred years, it was given up to the British Government in 1878.  </p>
Cyrene	<p>a city (now Tripoli) in Upper Libya, North Africa, founded by a colony of Greeks (B.C. 630). It contained latterly a large number of Jews, who were introduced into the city by Ptolemy, the son of Lagus, because he thought they would contribute to the security of the place. They increased in number and influence; and we are thus prepared for the frequent references to them in connection with the early history of Christianity. Simon, who bore our Lord's cross, was a native of this place ( Matthew 27:32 ;  Mark 15:21 ). Jews from Cyrene were in Jerusalem at Pentecost ( Acts 2:10 ); and Cyrenian Jews had a synagogue at Jerusalem ( 6:9 ). Converts belonging to Cyrene contributed to the formation of the first Gentile church at Antioch ( 11:20 ). Among "the prophets and teachers" who "ministered to the Lord at Antioch" was Lucius of Cyrene ( 13:1 ).  </p>
Cyrenius	<p>the Grecized form of Quirinus. His full name was Publius Sulpicius Quirinus. Recent historical investigation has proved that Quirinus was governor of Cilicia, which was annexed to Syria at the time of our Lord's birth. Cilicia, which he ruled, being a province of Syria, he is called the governor, which he was de jure, of Syria. Some ten years afterwards he was appointed governor of Syria for the second time. During his tenure of office, at the time of our Lord's birth ( Luke 2:2 ), a "taxing" (RSV, "enrolment;" i.e., a registration) of the people was "first made;" i.e., was made for the first time under his government. (See TAXING .) </p>
Cyrus	<p>(Heb. Ko'resh), the celebrated "King of Persia" (Elam) who was conqueror of Babylon, and issued the decree of liberation to the Jews ( Ezra 1:1 Ezra 1:2 ). He was the son of Cambyses, the prince of Persia, and was born about B.C. 599. In the year B.C. 559 he became king of Persia, the kingdom of Media being added to it partly by conquest. Cyrus was a great military leader, bent on universal conquest. Babylon fell before his army (B.C. 538) on the night of Belshazzar's feast ( Daniel 5:30 ), and then the ancient dominion of Assyria was also added to his empire (cf., "Go up, O Elam", Isa.21:2).  </p><p> Hitherto the great kings of the earth had only oppressed the Jews. Cyrus was to them as a "shepherd" ( Isaiah 44:28 ;  45:1 ). God employed him in doing service to his ancient people. He may posibly have gained, through contact with the Jews, some knowledge of their religion.  </p><p> The "first year of Cyrus" ( Ezra 1:1 ) is not the year of his elevation to power over the Medes, nor over the Persians, nor the year of the fall of Babylon, but the year succeeding the two years during which "Darius the Mede" was viceroy in Babylon after its fall. At this time only (B.C. 536) Cyrus became actual king over Palestine, which became a part of his Babylonian empire. The edict of Cyrus for the rebuilding of Jerusalem marked a great epoch in the history of the Jewish people ( 2 Chronicles 36:22 2 Chronicles 36:23 ;  Ezra 1:1-4 ;  4:3 ;  5:13-17 ;  6:3-5 ).  </p><p> This decree was discovered "at Achmetha [RSV marg., "Ecbatana"], in the palace that is in the province of the Medes" ( Ezra 6:2 ). A chronicle drawn up just after the conquest of Babylonia by Cyrus, gives the history of the reign of Nabonidus (Nabunahid), the last king of Babylon, and of the fall of the Babylonian empire. In B.C. 538 there was a revolt in Southern Babylonia, while the army of Cyrus entered the country from the north. In June the Babylonian army was completely defeated at Opis, and immediately afterwards Sippara opened its gates to the conqueror. Gobryas (Ugbaru), the governor of Kurdistan, was then sent to Babylon, which surrendered "without fighting," and the daily services in the temples continued without a break. In October, Cyrus himself arrived, and proclaimed a general amnesty, which was communicated by Gobryas to "all the province of Babylon," of which he had been made governor. Meanwhile, Nabonidus, who had concealed himself, was captured, but treated honourably; and when his wife died, Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, conducted the funeral. Cyrus now assumed the title of "king of Babylon," claimed to be the descendant of the ancient kings, and made rich offerings to the temples. At the same time he allowed the foreign populations who had been deported to Babylonia to return to their old homes, carrying with them the images of their gods. Among these populations were the Jews, who, as they had no images, took with them the sacred vessels of the temple.  </p>
Dial	<p>for the measurement of time, only once mentioned in the Bible, erected by Ahaz ( 2 Kings 20:11 ;  Isaiah 38:8 ). The Hebrew word (ma'aloth) is rendered "steps" in Ex  Exodus 10:19 , and "degrees" in  2 Kings 20:9 2 Kings 20:10 2 Kings 20:11 . The <i> ma'aloth</i> was probably stairs on which the shadow of a column or obelisk placed on the top fell. The shadow would cover a greater or smaller number of steps, according as the sun was low or high. </p><p> Probably the sun-dial was a Babylonian invention. Daniel at Babylon ( Daniel 3:6 ) is the first to make mention of the "hour."  </p>
Diamond	<p></p><li> A precious gem (Heb. yahalom', in allusion to its hardness), otherwise unknown, the sixth, i.e., the third in the second row, in the breastplate of the high priest, with the name of Naphtali engraven on it ( Exodus 28:18 ;  39:11 ; RSV marg., "sardonyx.")  </li><li> A precious stone (Heb. shamir', a sharp point) mentioned in  Jeremiah 17:1 . From its hardness it was used for cutting and perforating other minerals. It is rendered "adamant" (q.v.) in  Ezekiel 3:9 ,  Zechariah 7:12 . It is the hardest and most valuable of precious stones.   </li>
Diana	<p>so called by the Romans; called Artemis by the Greeks, the "great" goddess worshipped among heathen nations under various modifications. Her most noted temple was that at Ephesus. It was built outside the city walls, and was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. "First and last it was the work of 220 years; built of shining marble; 342 feet long by 164 feet broad; supported by a forest of columns, each 56 feet high; a sacred museum of masterpieces of sculpture and painting. At the centre, hidden by curtains, within a gorgeous shrine, stood the very ancient image of the goddess, on wood or ebony reputed to have fallen from the sky. Behind the shrine was a treasury, where, as in 'the safest bank in Asia,' nations and kings stored their most precious things. The temple as St. Paul saw it subsisted till A.D. 262, when it was ruined by the Goths" ( Acts 19:23-41 )., Moule on Ephesians: Introd.  </p>
Diblaim	<p>doubled cakes, the mother of Gomer, who was Hosea's wife ( Hosea 1:3 ).  </p>
Diblathaim	<p>two cakes, a city of Moab, on the east of the Dead Sea ( Numbers 33:46 ;  Jeremiah 48:22 ).  </p>
Dibon	<p>pining; wasting. </p><li> A city in Moab ( Numbers 21:30 ); called also Dibon-gad ( 33:45 ), because it was built by Gad and Dimon ( Isaiah 15:9 ). It has been identified with the modern Diban, about 3 miles north of the Arnon and 12 miles east of the Dead Sea. (See Moabite Stone.)  </li><li> A city of the tribe of Judah, inhabited after the Captivity ( Nehemiah 11:25 ); called also Dimonah ( Joshua 15:22 ). It is probably the modern ed-Dheib.   </li>
Didymus	<p>(Gr. twin = Heb. Thomas, q.v.),  John 11:16 ;  20:24 ;  21:2 .  </p>
Dimnah	<p>dunghill, a city of Zebulun given to the Merarite Levites ( Joshua 21:35 ). In  1 Chronicles 6:77  the name "Rimmon" is substituted.  </p>
Dinah	<p>judged; vindicated, daughter of Jacob by Leah, and sister of Simeon and Levi ( Genesis 30:21 ). She was seduced by Shechem, the son of Hamor, the Hivite chief, when Jacob's camp was in the neighbourhood of Shechem. This led to the terrible revenge of Simeon and Levi in putting the Shechemites to death ( Genesis 34 ). Jacob makes frequent reference to this deed of blood with abhorrence and regret ( Genesis 34:30 ;  49:5-7 ). She is mentioned among the rest of Jacob's family that went down into Egypt ( Genesis 46:8 Genesis 46:15 ).  </p>
Dine	<p>( Genesis 43:16 ). It was the custom in Egypt to dine at noon. But it is probable that the Egyptians took their principal meal in the evening, as was the general custom in the East ( Luke 14:12 ).  </p>
Dinhabah	<p>robbers' den, an Edomitish city, the capital of king Bela ( Genesis 36:32 ). It is probably the modern Dibdiba, a little north-east of Petra.  </p>
Dionysius	<p>the Areopagite, one of Paul's converts at Athens ( Acts 17:34 ).  </p>
Diotrephes	<p>Jove-nourished, rebuked by John for his pride ( 3 John 1:9 ). He was a Judaizer, prating against John and his fellow-labourers "with malicious words" (7).  </p>
Disciple	<p>a scholar, sometimes applied to the followers of John the Baptist ( Matthew 9:14 ), and of the Pharisees ( 22:16 ), but principally to the followers of Christ. A disciple of Christ is one who (1) believes his doctrine, (2) rests on his sacrifice, (3) imbibes his spirit, and (4) imitates his example ( Matthew 10:24 ;  Luke 14:26 Luke 14:27 Luke 14:33 ;  John 6:69 ).  </p>
Dish	<p>for eating from ( 2 Kings 21:13 ). Judas dipped his hand with a "sop" or piece of bread in the same dish with our Lord, thereby indicating friendly intimacy ( Matthew 26:23 ). The "lordly dish" in  Judges 5:25  was probably the shallow drinking cup, usually of brass. In  Judges 6:38  the same Hebrew word is rendered "bowl."  </p><p> The dishes of the tabernacle were made of pure gold ( Exodus 25:29 ;  37:16 ).  </p>
Dishan	<p>antelope, the youngest son of Seir the Horite, head of one of the tribes of Idumaea ( Genesis 36:21 Genesis 36:28 Genesis 36:30 ).  </p>
Dispensation	<p>(Gr. oikonomia, "management," "economy"). </p><li> The method or scheme according to which God carries out his purposes towards men is called a dispensation. There are usually reckoned three dispensations, the Patriarchal, the Mosaic or Jewish, and the Christian. (See COVENANT, Administration of.) These were so many stages in God's unfolding of his purpose of grace toward men. The word is not found with this meaning in Scripture.  </li><li> A commission to preach the gospel ( 1 Corinthians 9:17 ;  Ephesians 1:10 ;  3:2 ;  Colossians 1:25 ).  <p> Dispensations of Providence are providential events which affect men either in the way of mercy or of judgement. </p> </li>
Dispersion	<p>(Gr. diaspora, "scattered,"  James 1:1 ;  1 Peter 1:1 ) of the Jews. At various times, and from the operation of divers causes, the Jews were separated and scattered into foreign countries "to the outmost parts of heaven" ( Deuteronomy 30:4 ).  </p><li> Many were dispersed over Assyria, Media, Babylonia, and Persia, descendants of those who had been transported thither by the Exile. The ten tribes, after existing as a separate kingdom for two hundred and fifty-five years, were carried captive (B.C. 721) by Shalmaneser (or Sargon), king of Assyria. They never returned to their own land as a distinct people, although many individuals from among these tribes, there can be no doubt, joined with the bands that returned from Babylon on the proclamation of Cyrus.  </li><li> Many Jews migrated to Egypt and took up their abode there. This migration began in the days of Solomon ( 2 Kings 18:21 2 Kings 18:24 ;  Isaiah 30:7 ). Alexander the Great placed a large number of Jews in Alexandria, which he had founded, and conferred on them equal rights with the Egyptians. Ptolemy Philadelphus, it is said, caused the Jewish Scriptures to be translated into Greek (the work began B.C. 284), for the use of the Alexandrian Jews. The Jews in Egypt continued for many ages to exercise a powerful influence on the public interests of that country. From Egypt they spread along the coast of Africa to Cyrene ( Acts 2:10 ) and to Ethiopia ( 8:27 ).  </li><li> After the time of Seleucus Nicator (B.C. 280), one of the captains of Alexander the Great, large numbers of Jews migrated into Syria, where they enjoyed equal rights with the Macedonians. From Syria they found their way into Asia Minor. Antiochus the Great, king of Syria and Asia, removed 3,000 families of Jews from Mesopotamia and Babylonia, and planted them in Phrygia and Lydia.  </li><li> From Asia Minor many Jews moved into Greece and Macedonia, chiefly for purposes of commerce. In the apostles' time they were found in considerable numbers in all the principal cities.  <p> From the time of Pompey the Great (B.C. 63) numbers of Jews from Palestine and Greece went to Rome, where they had a separate quarter of the city assigned to them. Here they enjoyed considerable freedom.  </p><p> Thus were the Jews everywhere scattered abroad. This, in the overruling providence of God, ultimately contributed in a great degree toward opening the way for the spread of the gospel into all lands. </p><p> Dispersion, from the plain of Shinar. This was occasioned by the confusion of tongues at Babel ( Genesis 11:9 ). They were scattered abroad "every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations" ( Genesis 10:5 Genesis 10:20 Genesis 10:31 ).  </p><p> The tenth chapter of Genesis gives us an account of the principal nations of the earth in their migrations from the plain of Shinar, which was their common residence after the Flood. In general, it may be said that the descendants of Japheth were scattered over the north, those of Shem over the central regions, and those of Ham over the extreme south. The following table shows how the different families were dispersed: </p><p> |    - Japheth |     - Gomer |       Cimmerians, Armenians |     - Magog |       Caucasians, Scythians |     - Madal |       Medes and Persian tribes |     - Javan |       - Elishah |         Greeks |       - Tarshish |         Etruscans, Romans |       - Chittim |         Cyprians, Macedonians |       - Dodanim |         Rhodians |     - Tubal |       Tibareni, Tartars |     - Mechech |       Moschi, Muscovites |     - Tiras |       Thracians | |    - Shem |     - Elam |       Persian tribes |     - Asshur |       Assyrian |     - Arphaxad |       - Abraham |         - Isaac |           - Jacob |             Hebrews |           - Esau |             Edomites |         - Ishmael |           Mingled with Arab tribes |     - Lud |       Lydians |     - Aram |       Syrians | |    - Ham |     - Cush |       Ethiopans |     - Mizrain |       Egyptians |     - Phut |       Lybians, Mauritanians |     - Canaan |       Canaanites, Phoenicians </p> </li>
Distaff	<p>(Heb. pelek, a "circle"), the instrument used for twisting threads by a whirl ( Proverbs 31:19 ).  </p>
Divination	<p>of false prophets ( Deuteronomy 18:10 Deuteronomy 18:14 ;  Micah 3:6 Micah 3:7 Micah 3:11 ), of necromancers ( 1 Samuel 28:8 ), of the Philistine priests and diviners ( 1 Samuel 6:2 ), of Balaam ( Joshua 13:22 ). Three kinds of divination are mentioned in  Ezekiel 21:21 , by arrows, consulting with images (the teraphim), and by examining the entrails of animals sacrificed. The practice of this art seems to have been encouraged in ancient Egypt. Diviners also abounded among the aborigines of Canaan and the Philistines ( Isaiah 2:6 ;  1 Samuel 28 ). At a later period multitudes of magicians poured from Chaldea and Arabia into the land of Israel, and pursued their occupations ( Isaiah 8:19 ;  2 Kings  21:6 ;  2 Chr  33:6 ). This superstition widely spread, and in the time of the apostles there were "vagabond Jews, exorcists" ( Acts 19:13 ), and men like Simon Magus ( Acts 8:9 ), Bar-jesus ( Acts 13:6 Acts 13:8 ), and other jugglers and impostors ( 19:19 ;  2 Tim  3:13 ). Every species and degree of this superstition was strictly forbidden by the law of Moses ( Exodus 22:18 ;  Leviticus 19:26 Leviticus 19:31 ;  20:27 ;  Deuteronomy 18:10 Deuteronomy 18:11 ).  </p><p> But beyond these various forms of superstition, there are instances of divination on record in the Scriptures by which God was pleased to make known his will. </p><li> There was divination by lot, by which, when resorted to in matters of moment, and with solemnity, God intimated his will ( Joshua 7:13 ). The land of Canaan was divided by lot ( Numbers 26:55 Numbers 26:56 ); Achan's guilt was detected ( Joshua 7:16-19 ), Saul was elected king ( 1 Samuel 10:20 1 Samuel 10:21 ), and Matthias chosen to the apostleship, by the solem lot ( Acts 1:26 ). It was thus also that the scape-goat was determined ( Leviticus 16:8-10 ).  </li><li> There was divination by dreams ( Genesis 20:6 ;  Deuteronomy 13:1 Deuteronomy 13:3 ;  Judges 7:13 Judges 7:15 ;  Matthew 1:20 ;  Matthew 2:12 Matthew 2:13 Matthew 2:19 Matthew 2:22 ). This is illustrated in the history of Joseph ( Genesis 41:25-32 ) and of ( Daniel 2:27 ;  4:19-28 ).  </li><li> By divine appointment there was also divination by the Urim and Thummim ( Numbers 27:21 ), and by the ephod.  </li><li> God was pleased sometimes to vouch-safe direct vocal communications to men ( Deuteronomy 34:10 ;  Exodus 3:4 ;  4:3 ;  Deuteronomy 4:14 Deuteronomy 4:15 ;  1 Kings 19:12 ). He also communed with men from above the mercy-seat ( Exodus 25:22 ), and at the door of the tabernacle ( Exodus 29:42 Exodus 29:43 ).  </li><li> Through his prophets God revealed himself, and gave intimations of his will ( 2 Kings 13:17 ;  Jeremiah 51:63 Jeremiah 51:64 ).   </li>
Divorce	<p>The dissolution of the marriage tie was regulated by the Mosaic law ( Deuteronomy 24:1-4 ). The Jews, after the Captivity, were reguired to dismiss the foreign women they had married contrary to the law ( Ezra 10:11-19 ). Christ limited the permission of divorce to the single case of adultery. It seems that it was not uncommon for the Jews at that time to dissolve the union on very slight pretences ( Matthew 5:31 Matthew 5:32 ;  19:1-9 ;  Mark 10:2-12 ;  Luke 16:18 ). These precepts given by Christ regulate the law of divorce in the Christian Church.  </p>
Dizahab	<p>region of gold, a place in the desert of Sinai, on the western shore of the Elanitic gulf ( Deuteronomy 1:1 ). It is now called Dehab.  </p>
Doctor	<p>( Luke 2:46 ;  5:17 ;  Acts 5:34 ), a teacher. The Jewish doctors taught and disputed in synagogues, or wherever they could find an audience. Their disciples were allowed to propose to them questions. They assumed the office without any appointment to it. The doctors of the law were principally of the sect of the Pharisees. Schools were established after the destruction of Jerusalem at Babylon and Tiberias, in which academical degrees were conferred on those who passed a certain examination. Those of the school of Tiberias were called by the title "rabbi," and those of Babylon by that of "master."  </p>
Dodai	<p>loving, one of David's captains ( 1 Chronicles 27:4 ). (See DODO [2].)  </p>
Dodanim	<p>leaders, a race descended from Javan ( Genesis 10:4 ). They are known in profane history as the Dardani, originally inhabiting Illyricum. They were a semi-Pelasgic race, and in the ethnographical table ( Genesis 10 ) they are grouped with the Chittim (q.v.). In  1 Chronicles 1:7 , they are called Rodanim. The LXX. and the Samaritan Version also read Rhodii, whence some have concluded that the Rhodians, the inhabitants of the island of Rhodes, are meant.  </p>
Dodo	<p>amatory; loving. </p><li> A descendant of Issachar ( Judges 10:1 ).  </li><li> An Ahohite, father of Eleazar, who was one of David's three heroes ( 2 Samuel 23:9 ;  1 Chronicles 11:12 ). He was the same with Dodai mentioned in  1 Chronicles 27:4 .  </li><li> A Bethlehemite, and father of Elhanan, who was one of David's thirty heroes ( 2 Samuel 23:24 ).   </li>
Doeg	<p>fearful, an Edomite, the chief overseer of Saul's flocks ( 1 Samuel 21:7 ). At the command of Saul he slew the high priest Ahimelech (q.v.) at Nob, together with all the priests to the number of eighty-five persons. (Compare  Psalms 52 , title.)  </p>
Dog	<p>frequently mentioned both in the Old and New Testaments. Dogs were used by the Hebrews as a watch for their houses ( Isaiah 56:10 ), and for guarding their flocks ( Job 30:1 ). There were also then as now troops of semi-wild dogs that wandered about devouring dead bodies and the offal of the streets ( 1 Kings 14:11 ;  16:4 ;  1 Kings 21:19 1 Kings 21:23 ;  22:38 ;  Psalms 59:6 Psalms 59:14 ).  </p><p> As the dog was an unclean animal, the terms "dog," "dog's head," "dead dog," were used as terms of reproach or of humiliation ( 1 Samuel 24:14 ;  2 Sam  3:8 ;  9:8 ;  16:9 ). Paul calls false apostles "dogs" (Phil  3:2 ). Those who are shut out of the kingdom of heaven are also so designated ( Revelation 22:15 ). Persecutors are called "dogs" ( Psalms 22:16 ). Hazael's words, "Thy servant which is but a dog" ( 2 Kings 8:13 ), are spoken in mock humility=impossible that one so contemptible as he should attain to such power.  </p>
Doleful creatures	<p>(occurring only  Isaiah 13:21 . Heb. ochim, i.e., "shrieks;" hence "howling animals"), a general name for screech owls (howlets), which occupy the desolate palaces of Babylon. Some render the word "hyaenas."  </p>
Door-keeper	<p>This word is used in  Psalms 84:10  (RSV marg., "stand at the threshold of," etc.), but there it signifies properly "sitting at the threshold in the house of God." The psalmist means that he would rather stand at the door of God's house and merely look in, than dwell in houses where iniquity prevailed.  </p><p> Persons were appointed to keep the street door leading into the interior of the house ( John 18:16 John 18:17 ;  Acts 12:13 ). Sometimes females held this post.  </p>
Door-posts	<p>The Jews were commanded to write the divine name on the posts (mezuzoth') of their doors ( Deuteronomy 6:9 ). The Jews, misunderstanding this injunction, adopted the custom of writing on a slip of parchment these verses ( Deuteronomy 6:4-9 , and  11:13-21 ), which they enclosed in a reed or cylinder and fixed on the right-hand door-post of every room in the house.  </p>
Doors	<p>moved on pivots of wood fastened in sockets above and below ( Proverbs 26:14 ). They were fastened by a lock ( Judges 3:23 Judges 3:25 ; Cant  5:5 ) or by a bar ( Judges 16:3 ;  Job 38:10 ). In the interior of Oriental houses, curtains were frequently used instead of doors.  </p><p> The entrances of the tabernacle had curtains ( Exodus 26:31-33 Exodus 26:36 ). The "valley of Achor" is called a "door of hope," because immediately after the execution of Achan the Lord said to Joshua, "Fear not," and from that time Joshua went forward in a career of uninterrupted conquest. Paul speaks of a "door opened" for the spread of the gospel ( 1 Corinthians 16:9 ;  2 co  2:12 ;  Colossians 4:3 ). Our Lord says of himself, "I am the door" ( John 10:9 ). John ( Revelation 4:1 ) speaks of a "door opened in heaven."  </p>
Dophkah	<p>knocking, an encampment of the Israelites in the wilderness ( Numbers 33:12 ). It was in the desert of Sin, on the eastern shore of the western arm of the Red Sea, somewhere in the Wady Feiran.  </p>
Dor	<p>dwelling, the Dora of the Romans, an ancient royal city of the Canaanites ( Joshua 11:1 Joshua 11:2 ;  12:23 ). It was the most southern settlement of the Phoenicians on the coast of Syria. The original inhabitants seem never to have been expelled, although they were made tributary by David. It was one of Solomon's commissariat districts ( Judges 1:27 ;  1 Kings 4:11 ). It has been identified with Tantura (so named from the supposed resemblance of its tower to a tantur, i.e., "a horn"). This tower fell in 1895, and nothing remains but debris and foundation walls, the remains of an old Crusading fortress. It is about 8 miles north of Caesarea, "a sad and sickly hamlet of wretched huts on a naked sea-beach."  </p>
Dorcas	<p>a female antelope, or gazelle, a pious Christian widow at Joppa whom Peter restored to life ( Acts 9:36-41 ). She was a Hellenistic Jewess, called Tabitha by the Jews and Dorcas by the Greeks.  </p>
Dothan	<p>two wells, a famous pasture-ground where Joseph found his brethren watching their flocks. Here, at the suggestion of Judah, they sold him to the Ishmaelite merchants ( Genesis 37:17 ). It is mentioned on monuments in B.C. 1600.  </p><p> It was the residence of Elisha ( 2 Kings 6:13 ), and the scene of a remarkable vision of chariots and horses of fire surrounding the mountain on which the city stood. It is identified with the modern Tell-Dothan, on the south side of the plain of Jezreel, about 12 miles north of Samaria, among the hills of Gilboa. The "two wells" are still in existence, one of which bears the name of the "pit of Joseph" (Jubb Yusuf).  </p>
Dough	<p>(batsek, meaning "swelling," i.e., in fermentation). The dough the Israelites had prepared for baking was carried away by them out of Egypt in their kneading-troughs ( Exodus 12:34 Exodus 12:39 ). In the process of baking, the dough had to be turned ( Hosea 7:8 ).  </p>
Dove	<p>In their wild state doves generally build their nests in the clefts of rocks, but when domesticated "dove-cots" are prepared for them (Cant  2:14 ;  Jeremiah 48:28 ;  Isaiah 60:8 ). The dove was placed on the standards of the Assyrians and Babylonians in honour, it is supposed, of Semiramis ( Jeremiah 25:38 ; Vulg., "fierceness of the dove;" Compare  Jeremiah 46:16 ;  50:16 ). Doves and turtle-doves were the only birds that could be offered in sacrifice, as they were clean according to the Mosaic law ( Genesis 15:9 ;  Leviticus 5:7 ;  12:6 ;  Luke 2:24 ). The dove was the harbinger of peace to Noah ( Genesis 8:8 Genesis 8:10 ). It is often mentioned as the emblem of purity ( Psalms 68:13 ). It is a symbol of the Holy Spirit ( Genesis 1:2 ;  Matthew 3:16 ;  Mark 1:10 ;  Luke 3:22 ;  John 1:32 ); also of tender and devoted affection (Cant  1:15 ;  2:14 ). David in his distress wished that he had the wings of a dove, that he might fly away and be at rest ( Psalms 55:6-8 ). There is a species of dove found at Damascus "whose feathers, all except the wings, are literally as yellow as gold" ( 68:13 ).  </p>
Doves dung	<p>( 2 Kings 6:25 ) has been generally understood literally. There are instances in history of the dung of pigeons being actually used as food during a famine. Compare also the language of Rabshakeh to the Jews ( 2 Kings 18:27 ;  Isaiah 36:12 ). This name, however, is applied by the Arabs to different vegetable substances, and there is room for the opinion of those who think that some such substance is here referred to, as, e.g., the seeds of a kind of millet, or a very inferior kind of pulse, or the root of the ornithogalum, i.e., bird-milk, the star-of-Bethlehem.  </p>
Dowry	<p>(mohar; i.e., price paid for a wife,  Genesis 34:12 ;  Exodus 22:17 ;  1 Samuel 18:25 ), a nuptial present; some gift, as a sum of money, which the bridegroom offers to the father of his bride as a satisfaction before he can receive her. Jacob had no dowry to give for his wife, but he gave his services ( Genesis 29:18 ;  30:20 ;  34:12 ).  </p>
Dragon	<p></p><li> Heb. tannim, plural of tan. The name of some unknown creature inhabiting desert places and ruins ( Job 30:29 ;  Psalms 44:19 ;  Isaiah 13:22 ;  34:13 ;  43:20 ;  Jeremiah 10:22 ;  Micah 1:8 ;  Malachi 1:3 ); probably, as translated in the Revised Version, the jackal (q.v.).  </li><li> Heb. tannin. Some great sea monster ( Jeremiah 51:34 ). In  Isaiah 51:9  it may denote the crocodile. In  Genesis 1:21  (Heb. plural tanninim) the Authorized Version renders "whales," and the Revised Version "sea monsters." It is rendered "serpent" in  Exodus 7:9 . It is used figuratively in  Psalms 74:13 ;  Ezekiel 29:3 .  <p> In the New Testament the word "dragon" is found only in  Revelation 12:3 Revelation 12:4 Revelation 12:7 Revelation 12:9 Revelation 12:16 Revelation 12:17 , etc., and is there used metaphorically of "Satan." (See WHALE .) </p> </li>
Dragon well	<p>( Nehemiah 2:13 ), supposed by some to be identical with the Pool of Gihon.  </p>
Dram	<p>The Authorized Version understood the word 'adarkonim ( 1 Chronicles 29:7 ;  Ezra 8:27 ), and the similar word darkomnim ( Ezra 2:69 ;  Nehemiah 7:70 ), as equivalent to the Greek silver coin the drachma. But the Revised Version rightly regards it as the Greek dareikos, a Persian gold coin (the daric) of the value of about 1 pound, 2s., which was first struck by Darius, the son of Hystaspes, and was current in Western Asia long after the fall of the Persian empire. (See DARIC .) </p>
Draught-house	<p>( 2 Kings 10:27 ). Jehu ordered the temple of Baal to be destroyed, and the place to be converted to the vile use of receiving offal or ordure. (Compare  Matthew 15:17 .)  </p>
Drawer of water	<p>( Deuteronomy 29:11 ;  Joshua 9:21 Joshua 9:23 ), a servile employment to which the Gibeonites were condemned.  </p>
Dream	<p>God has frequently made use of dreams in communicating his will to men. The most remarkable instances of this are recorded in the history of Jacob ( Genesis 28:12 ;  31:10 ), Laban ( 31:24 ), Joseph ( 37:9-11 ), Gideon (Judg. 7), and Solomon ( 1 Kings 3:5 ). Other significant dreams are also recorded, such as those of Abimelech ( Genesis 20:3-7 ), Pharaoh's chief butler and baker ( 40:5 ), Pharaoh ( 41:1-8 ), the Midianites ( Judges 7:13 ), Nebuchadnezzar ( Daniel 2:1 ;  Daniel 4:10 Daniel 4:18 ), the wise men from the east ( Matthew 2:12 ), and Pilate's wife ( 27:19 ).  </p><p> To Joseph "the Lord appeared in a dream," and gave him instructions regarding the infant Jesus ( Matthew 1:20 ;  Matthew 2:12 Matthew 2:13 Matthew 2:19 ). In a vision of the night a "man of Macedonia" stood before Paul and said, "Come over into Macedonia and help us" ( Acts 16:9 ; see also  18:9 ;  27:23 ).  </p>
Dredge	<p>( Job 24:6 ). See CORN . </p>
Dregs	<p>( Psalms 75:8 ;  Isaiah 51:17 Isaiah 51:22 ), the lees of wine which settle at the bottom of the vessel.  </p>
Dress	<p></p><li> Materials used. The earliest and simplest an apron of fig-leaves sewed together ( Genesis 3:7 ); then skins of animals ( 3:21 ). Elijah's dress was probably the skin of a sheep ( 2 Kings 1:8 ). The Hebrews were early acquainted with the art of weaving hair into cloth ( Exodus 26:7 ;  35:6 ), which formed the sackcloth of mourners. This was the material of John the Baptist's robe ( Matthew 3:4 ). Wool was also woven into garments ( Leviticus 13:47 ;  Deuteronomy 22:11 ;  Ezekiel 34:3 ;  Job 31:20 ;  Proverbs 27:26 ). The Israelites probably learned the art of weaving linen when they were in Egypt ( 1 Chronicles 4:21 ). Fine linen was used in the vestments of the high priest ( Exodus 28:5 ), as well as by the rich ( Genesis 41:42 ;  Proverbs 31:22 ;  Luke 16:19 ). The use of mixed material, as wool and flax, was forbidden ( Leviticus 19:19 ;  Deuteronomy 22:11 ).  </li><li> Colour. The prevailing colour was the natural white of the material used, which was sometimes rendered purer by the fuller's art ( Psalms 104:1 Psalms 104:2 ;  Isaiah 63:3 ;  Mark 9:3 ). The Hebrews were acquainted with the art of dyeing ( Genesis 37:3 Genesis 37:23 ). Various modes of ornamentation were adopted in the process of weaving ( Exodus 28:6 ;  Exodus 26:1 Exodus 26:31 ;  35:25 ), and by needle-work ( Judges 5:30 ;  Psalms 45:13 ). Dyed robes were imported from foreign countries, particularly from Phoenicia ( Zephaniah 1:8 ). Purple and scarlet robes were the marks of the wealthy ( Luke 16:19 ;  2 Sam  1:24 ).  </li><li> Form. The robes of men and women were not very much different in form from each other.  <p> (a) The "coat" (kethoneth), of wool, cotton, or linen, was worn by both sexes. It was a closely-fitting garment, resembling in use and form our shirt ( John 19:23 ). It was kept close to the body by a girdle ( John 21:7 ). A person wearing this "coat" alone was described as naked ( 1 Samuel 19:24 ;  Isaiah 20:2 ;  2 Kings  6:30 ;  John 21:7 ); deprived of it he would be absolutely naked.  </p><p> (b) A linen cloth or wrapper (sadin) of fine linen, used somewhat as a night-shirt ( Mark 14:51 ). It is mentioned in Judg.  Mark 14:12 Mark 14:13 , and rendered there "sheets."  </p><p> (c) An upper tunic (meil), longer than the "coat" ( 1 Samuel 2:19 ;  24:4 ;  28:14 ). In  1 Samuel 28:14  it is the mantle in which Samuel was enveloped; in  1 Samuel 24:4  it is the "robe" under which Saul slept. The disciples were forbidden to wear two "coats" ( Matthew 10:10 ;  Luke 9:3 ).  </p><p> (d) The usual outer garment consisted of a piece of woollen cloth like a Scotch plaid, either wrapped round the body or thrown over the shoulders like a shawl, with the ends hanging down in front, or it might be thrown over the head so as to conceal the face ( 2 Samuel 15:30 ;  Esther 6:12 ). It was confined to the waist by a girdle, and the fold formed by the overlapping of the robe served as a pocket ( 2 Kings 4:39 ;  Psalms 79:12 ;  Haggai 2:12 ;  Proverbs 17:23 ;  21:14 ).  </p><p> Female dress. The "coat" was common to both sexes (Cant  5:3 ). But peculiar to females were (1) the "veil" or "wimple," a kind of shawl ( Ruth 3:15 ; rendered "mantle," RSV,  Isaiah 3:22 ); (2) the "mantle," also a species of shawl ( Isaiah 3:22 ); (3) a "veil," probably a light summer dress ( Genesis 24:65 ); (4) a "stomacher," a holiday dress ( Isaiah 3:24 ). The outer garment terminated in an ample fringe or border, which concealed the feet ( Isaiah 47:2 ;  Jeremiah 13:22 ).  </p><p> The dress of the Persians is described in  Daniel 3:21 .  </p><p> The reference to the art of sewing are few, inasmuch as the garments generally came forth from the loom ready for being worn, and all that was required in the making of clothes devolved on the women of a family ( Proverbs 31:22 ;  Acts 9:39 ).  </p><p> Extravagance in dress is referred to in  Jeremiah 4:30 ; Ezek.  16:10 ;  Zephaniah 1:8  (RSV, "foreign apparel");  1 Timothy 2:9 ;  1 Peter 3:3 . Rending the robes was expressive of grief ( Genesis 37:29 Genesis 37:34 ), fear ( 1 Kings 21:27 ), indignation ( 2 Kings 5:7 ), or despair ( Judges 11:35 ;  Esther 4:1 ).  </p><p> Shaking the garments, or shaking the dust from off them, was a sign of renunciation ( Acts 18:6 ); wrapping them round the head, of awe ( 1 Kings 19:13 ) or grief ( 2 Samuel 15:30 ; casting them off, of excitement ( Acts 22:23 ); laying hold of them, of supplication ( 1 Samuel 15:27 ). In the case of travelling, the outer garments were girded up ( 1 Kings 18:46 ). They were thrown aside also when they would impede action ( Mark 10:50 ;  John 13:4 ;  Acts 7:58 ).  </p> </li>
Drink	<p>The drinks of the Hebrews were water, wine, "strong drink," and vinegar. Their drinking vessels were the cup, goblet or "basin," the "cruse" or pitcher, and the saucer. </p><p> To drink water by measure ( Ezekiel 4:11 ), and to buy water to drink ( Lamentations 5:4 ), denote great scarcity. To drink blood means to be satiated with slaughter.  </p><p> The Jews carefully strained their drinks through a sieve, through fear of violating the law of  Leviticus 11:20 Leviticus 11:23 Leviticus 11:41 Leviticus 11:42 . (See   Matthew 23:24 . "Strain at" should be "strain out.")  </p>
Drink, strong	<p>(Heb. shekar'), an intoxicating liquor ( Judges 13:4 ;  Luke 1:15 ;  Isaiah 5:11 ;  Micah 2:11 ) distilled from corn, honey, or dates. The effects of the use of strong drink are referred to in  Psalms 107:27 ;  Isaiah 24:20 ;  49:26 ;  51:17-22 . Its use prohibited,  Proverbs 20:1 . (See WINE .) </p>
Drink-offering	<p>consisted of wine ( Numbers 15:5 ;  Hosea 9:4 ) poured around the altar ( Exodus 30:9 ). Joined with meat-offerings ( Numbers 6:15 Numbers 6:17 ;  2 Kings  16:13 ;  Joel 1:9 Joel 1:13 ;  2:14 ), presented daily ( Exodus 29:40 ), on the Sabbath ( Numbers 28:9 ), and on feast-days ( 28:14 ). One-fourth of an hin of wine was required for one lamb, one-third for a ram, and one-half for a bullock ( Numbers 15:5 ;  Numbers 28:7 Numbers 28:14 ). "Drink offerings of blood" ( Psalms 16:4 ) is used in allusion to the heathen practice of mingling the blood of animals sacrificed with wine or water, and pouring out the mixture in the worship of the gods, and the idea conveyed is that the psalmist would not partake of the abominations of the heathen.  </p>
Dromedary	<p>( Isaiah 60:6 ), an African or Arabian species of camel having only one hump, while the Bactrian camel has two. It is distinguished from the camel only as a trained saddle-horse is distinguished from a cart-horse. It is remarkable for its speed ( Jeremiah 2:23 ). Camels are frequently spoken of in partriarchal times ( Genesis 12:16 ;  24:10 ;  30:43 ;  31:17 , etc.). They were used for carrying burdens ( Genesis 37:25 ;  Judges 6:5 ), and for riding ( Genesis 24:64 ). The hair of the camel falls off of itself in spring, and is woven into coarse cloths and garments ( Matthew 3:4 ). (See CAMEL .) </p>
Dropsy	<p>mentioned only in  Luke 14:2 . The man afflicted with it was cured by Christ on the Sabbath.  </p>
Dross	<p>the impurities of silver separated from the one in the process of melting ( Proverbs 25:4 ;  26:23 ;  Psalms 119:119 ). It is also used to denote the base metal itself, probably before it is smelted, in  Isaiah 1:22 Isaiah 1:25 .  </p>
Drought	<p>From the middle of May to about the middle of August the land of Palestine is dry. It is then the "drought of summer" ( Genesis 31:40 ;  Psalms 32:4 ), and the land suffers ( Deuteronomy 28:23 :  Psalms 102:4 ), vegetation being preserved only by the dews ( Haggai 1:11 ). (See DEW .) </p>
Drown	<p>( Exodus 15:4 ;  Amos 8:8 ;  Hebrews 11:29 ). Drowning was a mode of capital punishment in use among the Syrians, and was known to the Jews in the time of our Lord. To this he alludes in  Matthew 18:6 .  </p>
Drunk	<p>The first case of intoxication on record is that of Noah ( Genesis 9:21 ). The sin of drunkenness is frequently and strongly condemned ( Romans 13:13 ;  1 Corinthians 6:9 1 Corinthians 6:10 ;  Ephesians 5:18 ;  1 Thessalonians 5:7 1 Thessalonians 5:8 ). The sin of drinking to excess seems to have been not uncommon among the Israelites.  </p><p> The word is used figuratively, when men are spoken of as being drunk with sorrow, and with the wine of God's wrath ( Isaiah 63:6 ;  Jeremiah 51:57 ;  Ezekiel 23:33 ). To "add drunkenness to thirst" ( Deuteronomy 29:19 , A.V.) is a proverbial expression, rendered in the Revised Version "to destroy the moist with the dry", i.e., the well-watered equally with the dry land, meaning that the effect of such walking in the imagination of their own hearts would be to destroy one and all.  </p>
Drusilla	<p>third and youngest daughter of Herod Agrippa I. ( Acts 12:1-4 Acts 12:20-23 ). Felix, the Roman procurator of Judea, induced her to leave her husband, Azizus, the king of Emesa, and become his wife. She was present with Felix when Paul reasoned of "righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come" ( Acts 24:24 ). She and her son perished in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, A.D. 79.  </p>
Duke	<p>derived from the Latin dux, meaning "a leader;" Arabic, "a sheik." This word is used to denote the phylarch or chief of a tribe ( Genesis 36:15-43 ;  Exodus 15:15 ;  1 Chronicles 1:51-54 ).  </p>
Dulcimer	<p>(Heb. sumphoniah), a musical instrument mentioned in  Daniel 3:5 Daniel 3:15 , along with other instruments there named, as sounded before the golden image. It was not a Jewish instrument. In the margin of the Revised Version it is styled the "bag-pipe." Luther translated it "lute," and Grotius the "crooked trumpet." It is probable that it was introduced into Babylon by some Greek or Western-Asiatic musician. Some Rabbinical commentators render it by "organ," the well-known instrument composed of a series of pipes, others by "lyre." The most probable interpretation is that it was a bag-pipe similar to the zampagna of Southern Europe.  </p>
Dumah	<p>silence, (Compare  Psalms 94:17 ), the fourth son of Ishmael; also the tribe descended from him; and hence also the region in Arabia which they inhabited ( Genesis 25:14 ;  1 Chronicles 1:30 ).  </p><p> There was also a town of this name in Judah ( Joshua 15:52 ), which has been identified with ed-Domeh, about 10 miles southwest of Hebron. The place mentioned in the "burden" of the prophet ( Isaiah 21:11 ) is Edom or Idumea.  </p>
Dumb	<p>from natural infirmity ( Exodus 4:11 ); not knowing what to say ( Proverbs 31:8 ); unwillingness to speak ( Psalms 39:9 ;  Leviticus 10:3 ). Christ repeatedly restored the dumb ( Matthew 9:32 Matthew 9:33 ;  Luke 11:14 ;  Matthew 12:22 ) to the use of speech.  </p>
Dung	<p></p><li> Used as manure ( Luke 13:8 ); collected outside the city walls ( Nehemiah 2:13 ). Of sacrifices, burned outside the camp ( Exodus 29:14 ;  Leviticus 4:11 ;  8:17 ;  Numbers 19:5 ). To be "cast out as dung," a figurative expression ( 1 Kings 14:10 ;  2 Kings  9:37 ;  Jeremiah 8:2 ;  Psalms 18:42 ), meaning to be rejected as unprofitable.  </li><li> Used as fuel, a substitute for firewood, which was with difficulty procured in Syria, Arabia, and Egypt ( Ezekiel 4:12-15 ), where cows' and camels' dung is used to the present day for this purpose.   </li>
Dungeon	<p>different from the ordinary prison in being more severe as a place of punishment. Like the Roman inner prison ( Acts 16:24 ), it consisted of a deep cell or cistern ( Jeremiah 38:6 ). To be shut up in, a punishment common in Egypt ( Genesis 39:20 ;  40:3 ;  41:10 ;  42:19 ). It is not mentioned, however, in the law of Moses as a mode of punishment. Under the later kings imprisonment was frequently used as a punishment ( 2 Chronicles 16:10 ;  Jeremiah 20:2 ;  32:2 ;  33:1 ;  37:15 ), and it was customary after the Exile ( Matthew 11:2 ;  Luke 3:20 ;  Acts 5:18 Acts 5:21 ;  Matthew 18:30 ).  </p>
Dung-gate	<p>( Nehemiah 2:13 ), a gate of ancient Jerusalem, on the south-west quarter. "The gate outside of which lay the piles of sweepings and offscourings of the streets," in the valley of Tophet.  </p>
Dung-hill	<p>to sit on a, was a sign of the deepest dejection ( 1 Samuel 2:8 ;  Psalms 113:7 ;  Lamentations 4:5 ).  </p>
Dura	<p>the circle, the plain near Babylon in which Nebuchadnezzar set up a golden image, mentioned in  Daniel 3:1 . The place still retains its ancient name. On one of its many mounds the pedestal of what must have been a colossal statue has been found. It has been supposed to be that of the golden image.  </p>
Dust	<p>Storms of sand and dust sometimes overtake Eastern travellers. They are very dreadful, many perishing under them. Jehovah threatens to bring on the land of Israel, as a punishment for forsaking him, a rain of "powder and dust" ( Deuteronomy 28:24 ).  </p><p> To cast dust on the head was a sign of mourning ( Joshua 7:6 ); and to sit in dust, of extreme affliction ( Isaiah 47:1 ). "Dust" is used to denote the grave ( Job 7:21 ). "To shake off the dust from one's feet" against another is to renounce all future intercourse with him ( Matthew 10:14 ;  Acts 13:51 ). To "lick the dust" is a sign of abject submission ( Psalms 72:9 ); and to throw dust at one is a sign of abhorrence ( 2 Samuel 16:13 ; Compare  Acts 22:23 ).  </p>
Dwarf	<p>a lean or emaciated person ( Leviticus 21:20 ).  </p>
Dwell	<p>Tents were in primitive times the common dwellings of men. Houses were afterwards built, the walls of which were frequently of mud ( Job 24:16 ;  Matthew 6:19 Matthew 6:20 ) or of sun-dried bricks.  </p><p> God "dwells in light" ( 1 Timothy 6:16 ;  1 John 1:7 ), in heaven ( Psalms 123:1 ), in his church ( Psalms 9:11 ;  1 John 4:12 ). Christ dwelt on earth in the days of his humiliation ( John 1:14 ). He now dwells in the hearts of his people ( Ephesians 3:17-19 ). The Holy Spirit dwells in believers ( 1 Corinthians 3:16 ;  2 Tim  1:14 ). We are exhorted to "let the word of God dwell in us richly" ( Colossians 3:16 ;  Psalms 119:11 ).  </p><p> Dwell deep occurs only in  Jeremiah 49:8 , and refers to the custom of seeking refuge from impending danger, in retiring to the recesses of rocks and caverns, or to remote places in the desert.  </p>
Dwellings	<p>The materials used in buildings were commonly bricks, sometimes also stones ( Leviticus 14:40 Leviticus 14:42 ), which were held together by cement ( Jeremiah 43:9 ) or bitumen ( Genesis 11:3 ). The exterior was usually whitewashed ( Leviticus 14:41 ;  Ezekiel 13:10 ;  Matthew 23:27 ). The beams were of sycamore ( Isaiah 9:10 ), or olive-wood, or cedar ( 1 Kings 7:2 ;  Isaiah 9:10 ).  </p><p> The form of Eastern dwellings differed in many respects from that of dwellings in Western lands. The larger houses were built in a quadrangle enclosing a court-yard ( Luke 5:19 ;  2 Sam  17:18 ;  Nehemiah 8:16 ) surrounded by galleries, which formed the guest-chamber or reception-room for visitors. The flat roof, surrounded by a low parapet, was used for many domestic and social purposes. It was reached by steps from the court. In connection with it ( 2 Kings 23:12 ) was an upper room, used as a private chamber ( 2 Samuel 18:33 ;  Daniel 6:11 ), also as a bedroom ( 2 Kings 23:12 ), a sleeping apartment for guests ( 2 Kings 4:10 ), and as a sick-chamber ( 1 Kings 17:19 ). The doors, sometimes of stone, swung on morticed pivots, and were generally fastened by wooden bolts. The houses of the more wealthy had a doorkeeper or a female porter ( John 18:16 ;  Acts 12:13 ). The windows generally opened into the courtyard, and were closed by a lattice (Judg.  5:28 ). The interior rooms were set apart for the female portion of the household.  </p><p> The furniture of the room ( 2 Kings 4:10 ) consisted of a couch furnished with pillows ( Amos 6:4 ;  Ezekiel 13:20 ); and besides this, chairs, a table and lanterns or lamp-stands ( 2 Kings 4:10 ).  </p>
Dye	<p>The art of dyeing is one of great antiquity, although no special mention is made of it in the Old Testament. The Hebrews probably learned it from the Egyptians (see  Exodus 26:1 ;  28:5-8 ), who brought it to great perfection. In New Testament times Thyatira was famed for its dyers ( Acts 16:14 ). (See COLOUR .) </p>
Emmor	<p>an ass,  Acts 7:16 . (See HAMOR .) </p>
Encamp	<p>An encampment was the resting-place for a longer or shorter period of an army or company of travellers ( Exodus 13:20 ;  14:19 ;  Joshua 10:5 ;  11:5 ).  </p><p> The manner in which the Israelites encamped during their march through the wilderness is described in  Numbers 2  and 3. The order of the encampment (see CAMP) was preserved in the march ( Numbers 2:17 ), the signal for which was the blast of two silver trumpets. Detailed regulations affecting the camp for sanitary purposes are given ( Leviticus 4:11 Leviticus 4:12 ;  6:11 ;  8:17 ;  Leviticus 10:4 Leviticus 10:5 ;  13:46 ;  14:3 ;  Numbers 12:14 Numbers 12:15 ;  31:19 ;  Deuteronomy 23:10 Deuteronomy 23:12 ).  </p><p> Criminals were executed without the camp ( Leviticus 4:12 ; Compare  John 19:17 John 19:20 ), and there also the young bullock for a sin-offering was burnt ( Leviticus 24:14 ; Compare  Hebrews 13:12 ).  </p><p> In the subsequent history of Israel frequent mention is made of their encampments in the time of war ( Judges 7:18 ;  1 Samuel 13:2 1 Samuel 13:3 1 Samuel 13:16 1 Samuel 13:23 ;  17:3 ;  29:1 ;  1 Samuel 30:9 1 Samuel 30:24 ). The temple was sometimes called "the camp of the Lord" ( 2 Chronicles 31:2 , RSV; Compare  Psalms 78:28 ). The multitudes who flocked to David are styled "a great host (i.e., "camp;" Heb. mahaneh), like the host of God" ( 1 Chronicles 12:22 ).  </p>
Enchantments	<p></p><li> The rendering of Hebrew <i> latim_ or _lehatim</i> , which means "something covered," "muffled up;" secret arts, tricks ( Exodus 7:11 Exodus 7:22 ;  Exodus 8:7 Exodus 8:18 ), by which the Egyptian magicians imposed on the credulity of Pharaoh.  </li><li> The rendering of the Hebrew <i> keshaphim</i> , "muttered spells" or "incantations," rendered "sorceries" in  Isaiah 47:9 Isaiah 47:12 , i.e., the using of certain formulae under the belief that men could thus be bound.  </li><li> Hebrew <i> lehashim</i> , "charming," as of serpents ( Jeremiah 8:17 ; Compare  Psalms 58:5 ).  </li><li> Hebrew <i> nehashim</i> , the enchantments or omens used by Balaam ( Numbers 24:1 ); his endeavouring to gain omens favourable to his design.  </li><li> Hebrew <i> heber</i> ( Isaiah 47:9 Isaiah 47:12 ), "magical spells." All kinds of enchantments were condemned by the Mosaic law ( Leviticus 19:26 ;  Deuteronomy 18:10-12 ). (See DIVINATION .)  </li>
End	<p>in  Hebrews 13:7 , is the rendering of the unusual Greek word <i> ekbasin</i> , meaning "outcome", i.e., death. It occurs only elsewhere in  1 Corinthians 10:13 , where it is rendered "escape."  </p>
Endor	<p>fountain of Dor; i.e., "of the age", a place in the territory of Issachar ( Joshua 17:11 ) near the scene of the great victory which was gained by Deborah and Barak over Sisera and Jabin (Compare  Psalms 83:9 Psalms 83:10 ). To Endor, Saul resorted to consult one reputed to be a witch on the eve of his last engagement with the Philistines ( 1 Samuel 28:7 ). It is identified with the modern village of Endur, "a dirty hamlet of some twenty houses, or rather huts, most of them falling to ruin," on the northern slope of Little Hermon, about 7 miles from Jezreel.  </p>
En-eglaim	<p>fountain of two calves, a place mentioned only in  Ezekiel 47:10 . Somewhere near the Dead Sea.  </p>
En-gannim	<p>fountain of gardens. </p><li> A town in the plains of Judah ( Joshua 15:34 ), north-west of Jerusalem, between Zanoah and Tappuah. It is the modern Umm Jina.  </li><li> A city on the border of Machar ( Joshua 19:21 ), allotted to the Gershonite Levites ( 21:29 ). It is identified with the modern Jenin, a large and prosperous town of about 4,000 inhabitants, situated 15 miles south of Mount Tabor, through which the road from Jezreel to Samaria and Jerusalem passes. When Ahaziah, king of Judah, attempted to escape from Jehu, he "fled by the way of the garden house" i.e., by way of En-gannim. Here he was overtaken by Jehu and wounded in his chariot, and turned aside and fled to Megiddo, a distance of about 20 miles, to die there.   </li>
Engedi	<p>fountain of the kid, place in the wilderness of Judah ( Joshua 15:62 ), on the western shore of the Dead Sea ( Ezekiel 47:10 ), and nearly equidistant from both extremities. To the wilderness near this town David fled for fear of Saul ( Joshua 15:62 ;  1 Samuel 23:29 ). It was at first called Hazezon-tamar ( Genesis 14:7 ), a city of the Amorites.  </p><p> The vineyards of Engedi were celebrated in Solomon's time (Cant  1:4 ). It is the modern 'Ain Jidy. The "fountain" from which it derives its name rises on the mountain side about 600 feet above the sea, and in its rapid descent spreads luxuriance all around it. Along its banks the osher grows abundantly. That shrub is thus described by Porter: "The stem is stout, measuring sometimes nearly a foot in diameter, and the plant grows to the height of 15 feet or more. It has a grayish bark and long oval leaves, which when broken off discharge a milky fluid. The fruit resembles an apple, and hangs in clusters of two or three. When ripe it is of a rich yellow colour, but on being pressed it explodes like a puff-ball. It is chiefly filled with air...This is the so-called 'apple of Sodom.'" Through Samaria, etc. (See APPLE .) </p>
Engines	<p></p><li> Heb. hishalon i.e., "invention" (as in Eccl  7:29 ) contrivances indicating ingenuity. In  2 Chronicles 26:15  it refers to inventions for the purpose of propelling missiles from the walls of a town, such as stones (the Roman balista) and arrows (the catapulta).  </li><li> Heb. mechi kobollo, i.e., the beating of that which is in front a battering-ram ( Ezekiel 26:9 ), the use of which was common among the Egyptians and the Assyrians. Such an engine is mentioned in the reign of David ( 2 Samuel 20:15 ).   </li>
Engraver	<p>Heb. harash ( Exodus 35:35 ;  38:23 ) means properly an artificer in wood, stone, or metal. The chief business of the engraver was cutting names or devices on rings and seals and signets ( Exodus 28:11 Exodus 28:21 Exodus 28:36 ;  Genesis 38:18 ).  </p>
En-hakkore	<p>fountain of the crier, the name of the spring in Lehi which burst forth in answer to Samson's prayer when he was exhausted with the slaughter of the Philistines ( Judges 15:19 ). It has been identified with the spring 'Ayun Kara, near Zoreah.  </p>
Enmity	<p>deep-rooted hatred. "I will put enmity between thee and the woman, between thy seed and her seed" ( Genesis 3:15 ). The friendship of the world is "enmity with God" ( James 4:4 ;  1 John 2:15 1 John 2:16 ). The "carnal mind" is "enmity against God" ( Romans 8:7 ). By the abrogation of the Mosaic institutes the "enmity" between Jew and Gentile is removed. They are reconciled, are "made one" ( Ephesians 2:15 Ephesians 2:16 ).  </p>
Enoch	<p>initiated. </p><li> The eldest son of Cain ( Genesis 4:17 ), who built a city east of Eden in the land of Nod, and called it "after the name of his son Enoch." This is the first "city" mentioned in Scripture.  </li><li> The son of Jared, and father of Methuselah ( Genesis 5:21 ;  Luke 3:37 ). His father was one hundred and sixty-two years old when he was born. After the birth of Methuselah, Enoch "walked with God three hundred years" ( Genesis 5:22-24 ), when he was translated without tasting death. His whole life on earth was three hundred and sixty-five years. He was the "seventh from Adam" ( Jude 1:14 ), as distinguished from the son of Cain, the third from Adam. He is spoken of in the catalogue of Old Testament worthies in the Epistle to the ( Hebrews 11:5 ). When he was translated, only Adam, so far as recorded, had as yet died a natural death, and Noah was not yet born. Mention is made of Enoch's prophesying only in  Jude 1:14 .   </li>
Enos	<p>man the son of Seth, and grandson of Adam ( Genesis 5:6-11 ;  Luke 3:38 ). He lived nine hundred and five years. In his time "men began to call upon the name of the Lord" ( Genesis 4:26 ), meaning either (1) then began men to call themselves by the name of the Lord (marg.) i.e., to distinguish themselves thereby from idolaters; or (2) then men in some public and earnest way began to call upon the Lord, indicating a time of spiritual revival.  </p>
En-rogel	<p>fountain of the treaders; i.e., "foot-fountain;" also called the "fullers' fountain," because fullers here trod the clothes in water. It has been identified with the "fountain of the virgin" (q.v.), the modern 'Ain Ummel-Daraj. Others identify it, with perhaps some probability, with the Bir Eyub, to the south of the Pool of Siloam, and below the junction of the valleys of Kidron and Hinnom. (See FOUNTAIN .) </p><p> It was at this fountain that Jonathan and Ahimaaz lay hid after the flight of David ( 2 Samuel 17:17 ); and here also Adonijah held the feast when he aspired to the throne of his father ( 1 Kings 1:9 ).  </p><p> The Bir Eyub, or "Joab's well," "is a singular work of ancient enterprise. The shaft sunk through the solid rock in the bed of the Kidron is 125 feet deep...The water is pure and entirely sweet, quite different from that of Siloam; which proves that there is no connection between them." Thomson's Land and the Book.  </p>
En-shemesh	<p>fountain of the sun a spring which formed one of the landmarks on the boundary between Judah and Benjamin ( Joshua 15:7 ;  18:17 ). It was between the "ascent of Adummim" and the spring of En-rogel, and hence was on the east of Jerusalem and of the Mount of Olives. It is the modern 'Ain-Haud i.e., the "well of the apostles" about a mile east of Bethany, the only spring on the road to Jericho. The sun shines on it the whole day long.  </p>
Ensign	<p></p><li> Heb. 'oth, a military standard, especially of a single tribe ( Numbers 2:2 ). Each separate tribe had its own "sign" or "ensign."  </li><li> Heb. nes, a lofty signal, as a column or high pole ( Numbers 21:8 Numbers 21:9 ); a standard or signal or flag placed on high mountains to point out to the people a place of rendezvous on the irruption of an enemy ( Isaiah 5:26 ;  11:12 ;  18:3 ;  62:10 ;  Jeremiah 4:6 Jeremiah 4:21 ;  Psalms 60:4 ). This was an occasional signal, and not a military standard. Elevation and conspicuity are implied in the word.  </li><li> The Hebrew word <i> degel</i> denotes the standard given to each of the four divisions of the host of the Israelites at the Exodus ( Numbers 1:52 ;  2:2 ;  10:14 ). In Cant  2:4  it is rendered "banner." We have no definite information as to the nature of these military standards. (See BANNER .)  </li>
Entertain	<p>Entertainments, "feasts," were sometimes connected with a public festival ( Deuteronomy 16:11 Deuteronomy 16:14 ), and accompanied by offerings ( 1 Samuel 9:13 ), in token of alliances ( Genesis 26:30 ); sometimes in connection with domestic or social events, as at the weaning of children ( Genesis 21:8 ), at weddings ( Genesis 29:22 ;  John 2:1 ), on birth-days ( Matthew 14:6 ), at the time of sheep-shearing ( 2 Samuel 13:23 ), and of vintage ( Judges 9:27 ), and at funerals ( 2 Samuel 3:35 ;  Jeremiah 16:7 ).  </p><p> The guests were invited by servants ( Proverbs 9:3 ;  Matthew 22:3 ), who assigned them their respective places ( 1 Samuel 9:22 ;  Luke 14:8 ;  Mark 12:39 ). Like portions were sent by the master to each guest ( 1 Samuel 1:4 ;  2 Sam  6:19 ), except when special honour was intended, when the portion was increased ( Genesis 43:34 ).  </p><p> The Israelites were forbidden to attend heathenish sacrificial entertainments ( Exodus 34:15 ), because these were in honour of false gods, and because at such feast they would be liable to partake of unclean flesh ( 1 Corinthians 10:28 ).  </p><p> In the entertainments common in apostolic times among the Gentiles were frequent "revellings," against which Christians were warned ( Romans 13:13 ;  Galatians 5:21 ;  1 Peter 4:3 ). (See BANQUET .) </p>
Epaenetus	<p>commendable, a Christian at Rome to whom Paul sent his salutation ( Romans 16:5 ). He is spoken of as "the first fruits of Achaia" (RSV, "of Asia", i.e., of proconsular Asia, which is probably the correct reading). As being the first convert in that region, he was peculiarly dear to the apostle. He calls him his "well beloved."  </p>
Epaphras	<p>lovely, spoken of by Paul ( Colossians 1:7 ;  4:12 ) as "his dear fellow-servant," and "a faithful minister of Christ." He was thus evidently with him at Rome when he wrote to the Colossians. He was a distinguished disciple, and probably the founder of the Colossian church. He is also mentioned in the Epistle to ( Philemon 1:23 ), where he is called by Paul his "fellow-prisoner."  </p>
Epaphroditus	<p>fair, graceful; belonging to Aphrodite or Venus the messenger who came from Phillipi to the apostle when he was a prisoner at Rome (Phil  <span class="badLink">2:25-30</span> ;  <span class="badLink">4:10-18</span> ). Paul mentions him in words of esteem and affection. On his return to Philippi he was the bearer of Paul's letter to the church there.  </p>
Ephah	<p>gloom. </p><li> One of the five sons of Midian, and grandson of Abraham ( Genesis 25:4 ). The city of Ephah, to which he gave his name, is mentioned  Isaiah 60:6 Isaiah 60:7 . This city, with its surrounding territory, formed part of Midian, on the east shore of the Dead Sea. It abounded in dromedaries and camels ( Judges 6:5 ).  </li><li> 1 Chronicles 2:46 , a concubine of Caleb.  </li><li> 1 Chronicles 2:47 , a descendant of Judah.  <p> Ephah, a word of Egyptian origin, meaning measure; a grain measure containing "three seahs or ten omers," and equivalent to the bath for liquids ( Exodus 16:36 ;  1 Samuel 17:17 ;  Zechariah 5:6 ). The double ephah in  Proverbs 20:10  (marg., "an ephah and an ephah"),  Deuteronomy 25:14 , means two ephahs, the one false and the other just.  </p> </li>
Epher	<p>a calf. </p><li> One of the sons of Midian, who was Abraham's son by Keturah ( Genesis 25:4 ).  </li><li> The head of one of the families of trans-Jordanic Manasseh who were carried captive by Tiglath-pileser ( 1 Chronicles 5:24 ).   </li>
Ephes-dammim	<p>boundary of blood, a place in the tribe of Judah where the Philistines encamped when David fought with Goliath ( 1 Samuel 17:1 ). It was probably so called as having been the scene of frequent sanguinary conflicts between Israel and the Philistines. It is called Pas-dammim ( 1 Chronicles 11:13 ). It has been identified with the modern Beit Fased, i.e., "house of bleeding", near Shochoh (q.v.).  </p>
Ephesians, Epistle to	<p>was written by Paul at Rome about the same time as that to the Colossians, which in many points it resembles. </p><p> Contents of. The Epistle to the Colossians is mainly polemical, designed to refute certain theosophic errors that had crept into the church there. That to the Ephesians does not seem to have originated in any special circumstances, but is simply a letter springing from Paul's love to the church there, and indicative of his earnest desire that they should be fully instructed in the profound doctrines of the gospel. It contains (1) the salutation ( 1 Chronicles 1:1 1 Chronicles 1:2 ); (2) a general description of the blessings the gospel reveals, as to their source, means by which they are attained, purpose for which they are bestowed, and their final result, with a fervent prayer for the further spiritual enrichment of the ( Ephesians (1:3-2:10); ); (3) "a record of that marked change in spiritual position which the Gentile believers now possessed, ending with an account of the writer's selection to and qualification for the apostolate of heathendom, a fact so considered as to keep them from being dispirited, and to lead him to pray for enlarged spiritual benefactions on his absent sympathizers" ( (2:12-3:21); ); (4) a chapter on unity as undisturbed by diversity of gifts ( 4:1-16 ); (5) special injunctions bearing on ordinary life ( (4:17-6:10); ); (6) the imagery of a spiritual warfare, mission of Tychicus, and valedictory blessing ( 6:11-24 ).  </p><p> Planting of the church at Ephesus. Paul's first and hurried visit for the space of three months to Ephesus is recorded in  Acts 18:19-21 . The work he began on this occasion was carried forward by Apollos (24-26) and Aquila and Priscilla. On his second visit, early in the following year, he remained at Ephesus "three years," for he found it was the key to the western provinces of Asia Minor. Here "a great door and effectual" was opened to him ( 1 Corinthians 16:9 ), and the church was established and strengthened by his assiduous labours there ( Acts 20:20 Acts 20:31 ). From Ephesus as a centre the gospel spread abroad "almost throughout all Asia" ( 19:26 ). The word "mightily grew and prevailed" despite all the opposition and persecution he encountered.  </p><p> On his last journey to Jerusalem the apostle landed at Miletus, and summoning together the elders of the church from Ephesus, delivered to them his remarkable farewell charge ( Acts 20:18-35 ), expecting to see them no more.  </p><p> The following parallels between this epistle and the Milesian charge may be traced: </p><li> Acts 20:19  =  Ephesians 4:2 . The phrase "lowliness of mind" occurs nowhere else.  </li><li> Acts 20:27  =  Ephesians 1:11 . The word "counsel," as denoting the divine plan, occurs only here and  Hebrews 6:17 .  </li><li> Acts 20:32  =  Ephesians 3:20 . The divine ability.  </li><li> Acts 20:32  =  Ephesians 2:20 . The building upon the foundation.  </li><li> Acts 20:32  =  Ephesians 1:14 Ephesians 1:18 . "The inheritance of the saints."  <p> Place and date of the writing of the letter. It was evidently written from Rome during Paul's first imprisonment ( 3:1 ;  4:1 ;  6:20 ), and probably soon after his arrival there, about the year 62, four years after he had parted with the Ephesian elders at Miletus. The subscription of this epistle is correct.  </p><p> There seems to have been no special occasion for the writing of this letter, as already noted. Paul's object was plainly not polemical. No errors had sprung up in the church which he sought to point out and refute. The object of the apostle is "to set forth the ground, the cause, and the aim and end of the church of the faithful in Christ. He speaks to the Ephesians as a type or sample of the church universal." The church's foundations, its course, and its end, are his theme. "Everywhere the foundation of the church is the will of the Father; the course of the church is by the satisfaction of the Son; the end of the church is the life in the Holy Spirit." In the Epistle to the Romans, Paul writes from the point of view of justification by the imputed righteousness of Christ; here he writes from the point of view specially of union to the Redeemer, and hence of the oneness of the true church of Christ. "This is perhaps the profoundest book in existence." It is a book "which sounds the lowest depths of Christian doctrine, and scales the loftiest heights of Christian experience;" and the fact that the apostle evidently expected the Ephesians to understand it is an evidence of the "proficiency which Paul's converts had attained under his preaching at Ephesus." </p><p> Relation between this epistle and that to the Colossians (q.v.). "The letters of the apostle are the fervent outburst of pastoral zeal and attachment, written without reserve and in unaffected simplicity; sentiments come warm from the heart, without the shaping out, pruning, and punctilious arrangement of a formal discourse. There is such a fresh and familiar transcription of feeling, so frequent an introduction of coloquial idiom, and so much of conversational frankness and vivacity, that the reader associates the image of the writer with every paragraph, and the ear seems to catch and recognize the very tones of living address." "Is it then any matter of amazement that one letter should resemble another, or that two written about the same time should have so much in common and so much that is peculiar? The close relation as to style and subject between the epistles to Colosse and Ephesus must strike every reader. Their precise relation to each other has given rise to much discussion. The great probability is that the epistle to Colosse was first written; the parallel passages in Ephesians, which amount to about forty-two in number, having the appearance of being expansions from the epistle to Colosse. Compare: </p><p> Ephesians 1:7 ;  Colossians 1:14 Ephesians 1:10 ;  Colossians 1:20 Ephesians 3:2 ;  Colossians 1:25 Ephesians 5:19 ;  Colossians 3:16 Ephesians 6:22 ;  Colossians 4:8 Ephesians 1:19-2:5; ;  Colossians 2:12 Colossians 2:13 Ephesians 4:2-4 ;  Colossians 3:12-15 Ephesians 4:16 ;  Colossians 2:19 Ephesians 4:32 ;  Colossians 3:13 Ephesians 4:22-24 ;  Colossians 3:9 Colossians 3:10 Ephesians 5:6-8 ;  Colossians 3:6-8 Ephesians 5:15 Ephesians 5:16 ;  Colossians 4:5 Ephesians 6:19 Ephesians 6:20 ;  Colossians 4:3 Colossians 4:4 Ephesians 5:22-6:9; ;  Colossians 3:18-4:1 </p><p> "The style of this epistle is exceedingly animated, and corresponds with the state of the apostle's mind at the time of writing. Overjoyed with the account which their messenger had brought him of their faith and holiness ( Ephesians 1:15 ), and transported with the consideration of the unsearchable wisdom of God displayed in the work of man's redemption, and of his astonishing love towards the Gentiles in making them partakers through faith of all the benefits of Christ's death, he soars high in his sentiments on those grand subjects, and gives his thoughts utterance in sublime and copious expression."  </p> </li>
Ephesus	<p>the capital of proconsular Asia, which was the western part of Asia Minor. It was colonized principally from Athens. In the time of the Romans it bore the title of "the first and greatest metropolis of Asia." It was distinguished for the Temple of Diana (q.v.), who there had her chief shrine; and for its theatre, which was the largest in the world, capable of containing 50,000 spectators. It was, like all ancient theatres, open to the sky. Here were exhibited the fights of wild beasts and of men with beasts. (Compare  1 Corinthians 4:9 ;  1 Corinthians 9:24 1 Corinthians 9:25 ;  15:32 .)  </p><p> Many Jews took up their residence in this city, and here the seeds of the gospel were sown immediately after Pentecost ( Acts 2:9 ;  6:9 ). At the close of his second missionary journey (about A.D. 51), when Paul was returning from Greece to Syria ( 18:18-21 ), he first visited this city. He remained, however, for only a short time, as he was hastening to keep the feast, probably of Pentecost, at Jerusalem; but he left Aquila and Priscilla behind him to carry on the work of spreading the gospel.  </p><p> During his third missionary journey Paul reached Ephesus from the "upper coasts" ( Acts 19:1 ), i.e., from the inland parts of Asia Minor, and tarried here for about three years; and so successful and abundant were his labours that "all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks" ( 19:10 ). Probably during this period the seven churches of the Apocalypse were founded, not by Paul's personal labours, but by missionaries whom he may have sent out from Ephesus, and by the influence of converts returning to their homes.  </p><p> On his return from his journey, Paul touched at Miletus, some 30 miles south of Ephesus ( Acts 20:15 ), and sending for the presbyters of Ephesus to meet him there, he delivered to them that touching farewell charge which is recorded in  Acts 20:18-35 . Ephesus is not again mentioned till near the close of Paul's life, when he writes to Timothy exhorting him to "abide still at Ephesus" ( 1 Timothy 1:3 ).  </p><p> Two of Paul's companions, Trophimus and Tychicus, were probably natives of Ephesus ( Acts 20:4 ;  21:29 ;  2 Tim  4:12 ). In his second epistle to Timothy, Paul speaks of Onesiphorus as having served him in many things at Ephesus ( 2 Timothy 1:18 ). He also "sent Tychicus to Ephesus" ( 4:12 ), probably to attend to the interests of the church there. Ephesus is twice mentioned in the Apocalypse ( 1:11 ;  2:1 ).  </p><p> The apostle John, according to tradition, spent many years in Ephesus, where he died and was buried. </p><p> A part of the site of this once famous city is now occupied by a small Turkish village, Ayasaluk, which is regarded as a corruption of the two Greek words, hagios theologos; i.e., "the holy divine." </p>
Ephod	<p>something girt, a sacred vestment worn originally by the high priest ( Exodus 28:4 ), afterwards by the ordinary priest ( 1 Samuel 22:18 ), and characteristic of his office ( 1 Samuel 2:18 1 Samuel 2:28 ;  14:3 ). It was worn by Samuel, and also by David ( 2 Samuel 6:14 ). It was made of fine linen, and consisted of two pieces, which hung from the neck, and covered both the back and front, above the tunic and outer garment ( Exodus 28:31 ). That of the high priest was embroidered with divers colours. The two pieces were joined together over the shoulders (hence in Latin called superhumerale) by clasps or buckles of gold or precious stones, and fastened round the waist by a "curious girdle of gold, blue, purple, and fine twined linen" ( 28:6-12 ).  </p><p> The breastplate, with the Urim and Thummim, was attached to the ephod. </p>
Ephphatha	<p>the Greek form of a Syro-Chaldaic or Aramaic word, meaning "Be opened," uttered by Christ when healing the man who was deaf and dumb ( Mark 7:34 ). It is one of the characteristics of Mark that he uses the very Aramaic words which fell from our Lord's lips. (See  3:17 ;  5:41 ;  7:11 ;  14:36 ;  15:34 .)  </p>
Ephraim	<p>double fruitfulness ("for God had made him fruitful in the land of his affliction"). The second son of Joseph, born in Egypt ( Genesis 41:52 ;  46:20 ). The first incident recorded regarding him is his being placed, along with his brother Manasseh, before their grandfather, Jacob, that he might bless them ( 48:10 ; Compare  27:1 ). The intention of Joseph was that the right hand of the aged patriarch should be placed on the head of the elder of the two; but Jacob set Ephraim the younger before his brother, "guiding his hands wittingly." Before Joseph's death, Ephraim's family had reached the third generation ( Genesis 50:23 ).  </p>
Ephraim in the wilderness	<p>( John 11: :  54 ), a town to which our Lord retired with his disciples after he had raised Lazarus, and when the priests were conspiring against him. It lay in the wild, uncultivated hill-country to the north-east of Jerusalem, betwen the central towns and the Jordan valley.  </p>
Ephraim, Gate of	<p>one of the gates of Jerusalem ( 2 Kings 14:13 ;  2 Chr  25:23 ), on the side of the city looking toward Ephraim, the north side.  </p>
Ephraim, Mount	<p>the central mountainous district of Palestine occupied by the tribe of Ephraim ( Joshua 17:15 ;  19:50 ;  20:7 ), extending from Bethel to the plain of Jezreel. In Joshua's time ( Joshua 17:18 ) these hills were densely wooded. They were intersected by well-watered, fertile valleys, referred to in  Jeremiah 50:19 . Joshua was buried at Timnath-heres among the mountains of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash ( Judges 2:9 ). This region is also called the "mountains of Israel" ( Joshua 11:21 ) and the "mountains of Samaria" ( Jeremiah 31:5 Jeremiah 31:6 :  Amos 3:9 ).  </p>
Ephraim, The tribe of	<p>took precedence over that of Manasseh by virtue of Jacob's blessing ( Genesis 41:52 ;  48:1 ). The descendants of Joseph formed two of the tribes of Israel, whereas each of the other sons of Jacob was the founder of only one tribe. Thus there were in reality thirteen tribes; but the number twelve was preserved by excluding that of Levi when Ephraim and Manasseh are mentioned separately ( Numbers 1:32-34 ;  Joshua 17:14 Joshua 17:17 ;  1 Chronicles 7:20 ).  </p><p> Territory of. At the time of the first census in the wilderness this tribe numbered 40,500 ( Numbers 1:32 Numbers 1:33 ); forty years later, when about to take possession of the Promised Land, it numbered only 32,500. During the march (see CAMP) Ephraim's place was on the west side of the tabernacle ( Numbers 2:18-24 ). When the spies were sent out to spy the land, "Oshea the son of Nun" of this tribe signalized himself.  </p><p> The boundaries of the portion of the land assigned to Ephraim are given in  Joshua 16:1-10 . It included most of what was afterwards called Samaria as distinguished from Judea and Galilee. It thus lay in the centre of all traffic, from north to south, and from Jordan to the sea, and was about 55 miles long and 30 broad. The tabernacle and the ark were deposited within its limits at Shiloh, where it remained for four hundred years. During the time of the judges and the first stage of the monarchy this tribe manifested a domineering and haughty and discontented spirit. "For more than five hundred years, a period equal to that which elapsed between the Norman Conquest and the War of the Roses, Ephraim, with its two dependent tribes of Manasseh and Benjamin, exercised undisputed pre-eminence. Joshua the first conqueror, Gideon the greatest of the judges, and Saul the first king, belonged to one or other of the three tribes. It was not till the close of the first period of Jewish history that God 'refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim, but chose the tribe of Judah, the Mount Zion which he loved' ( Psalms 78:67 Psalms 78:68 ). When the ark was removed from Shiloh to Zion the power of Ephraim was humbled."  </p><p> Among the causes which operated to bring about the disruption of Israel was Ephraim's jealousy of the growing power of Judah. From the settlement of Canaan till the time of David and Solomon, Ephraim had held the place of honour among the tribes. It occupied the central and fairest portions of the land, and had Shiloh and Shechem within its borders. But now when Jerusalem became the capital of the kingdom, and the centre of power and worship for the whole nation of Israel, Ephraim declined in influence. The discontent came to a crisis by Rehoboam's refusal to grant certain redresses that were demanded ( 1 Kings 12 ).  </p>
Ephraim, Wood of	<p>a forest in which a fatal battle was fought between the army of David and that of Absalom, who was killed there ( 2 Samuel 18:6 2 Samuel 18:8 ). It lay on the east of Jordan, not far from Mahanaim, and was some part of the great forest of Gilead.  </p>
Ephratah	<p>fruitful. </p><li> The second wife of Caleb, the son of Hezron, mother of Hur, and grandmother of Caleb, who was one of those that were sent to spy the land ( 1 Chronicles 2:19 1 Chronicles 2:50 ).  </li><li> The ancient name of Bethlehem in Judah ( Genesis 35:16 Genesis 35:19 ;  48:7 ). In  Ruth 1:2  it is called "Bethlehem-Judah," but the inhabitants are called "Ephrathites;" in  Micah 5:2 , "Bethlehem-Ephratah;" in  Matthew 2:6 , "Bethlehem in the land of Judah." In  Psalms 132:6  it is mentioned as the place where David spent his youth, and where he heard much of the ark, although he never saw it till he found it long afterwards at Kirjath-jearim; i.e., the "city of the wood," or the "forest-town" ( 1 Samuel 7:1 ; Compare  2 Samuel 6:3 2 Samuel 6:4 ).   </li>
Ephrathite	<p>a citizen of Ephratah, the old name of Bethlehem ( Ruth 1:2 ;  1 Samuel 17:12 ), or Bethlehem-Judah.  </p>
Ephron	<p>fawn-like. </p><li> The son of Zohar a Hittite, the owner of the field and cave of Machpelah (q.v.), which Abraham bought for 400 shekels of silver ( Genesis 23:8-17 ;  25:9 ;  Genesis 49:29 Genesis 49:30 ).  </li><li> A mountain range which formed one of the landmarks on the north boundary of the tribe of Judah ( Joshua 15:9 ), probably the range on the west side of the Wady Beit-Hanina.   </li>
Epicureans	<p>followers of Epicurus (who died at Athens B.C. 270), or adherents of the Epicurean philosophy ( Acts 17:18 ). This philosophy was a system of atheism, and taught men to seek as their highest aim a pleasant and smooth life. They have been called the "Sadducees" of Greek paganism. They, with the Stoics, ridiculed the teaching of Paul ( Acts 17:18 ). They appear to have been greatly esteemed at Athens.  </p>
Epistles	<p>the apostolic letters. The New Testament contains twenty-one in all. They are divided into two classes. </p><li> Paul's Epistles, fourteen in number, including Hebrews. These are not arranged in the New Testament in the order of time as to their composition, but rather according to the rank of the cities or places to which they were sent. Who arranged them after this manner is unknown. Paul's letters were, as a rule, dictated to an amanuensis, a fact which accounts for some of their peculiarities. He authenticated them, however, by adding a few words in his own hand at the close. (See GALATIANS, EPISTLE  TO .) <p> The epistles to Timothy and Titus are styled the Pastoral Epistles. </p></li><li> The Catholic or General Epistles, so called because they are not addressed to any particular church or city or individual, but to Christians in general, or to Christians in several countries. Of these, three are written by John, two by Peter, and one each by James and Jude.  <p> It is an interesting and instructive fact that a large portion of the New Testament is taken up with epistles. The doctrines of Christianity are thus not set forth in any formal treatise, but mainly in a collection of letters. "Christianity was the first great missionary religion. It was the first to break the bonds of race and aim at embracing all mankind. But this necessarily involved a change in the mode in which it was presented. The prophet of the Old Testament, if he had anything to communicate, either appeared in person or sent messengers to speak for him by word of mouth. The narrow limits of Palestine made direct personal communication easy. But the case was different when the Christian Church came to consist of a number of scattered parts, stretching from Mesopotamia in the east to Rome or even Spain in the far west. It was only natural that the apostle by whom the greater number of these communities had been founded should seek to communicate with them by letter." </p> </li>
Erastus	<p>beloved. </p><li> The "chamberlain" of the city of Corinth ( Romans 16:23 ), and one of Paul's disciples. As treasurer of such a city he was a public officer of great dignity, and his conversion to the gospel was accordingly a proof of the wonderful success of the apostle's labours.  </li><li> A companion of Paul at Ephesus, who was sent by him along with Timothy into Macedonia ( Acts 19:22 ). Corinth was his usual place of abode ( 2 Timothy 4:20 ); but probably he may have been the same as the preceding.   </li>
Erech	<p>(LXX., "Orech"), length, or Moon-town, one of the cities of Nimrod's kingdom in the plain of Shinar ( Genesis 10:10 ); the Orchoe of the Greeks and Romans. It was probably the city of the Archevites, who were transplanted to Samaria by Asnapper ( Ezra 4:9 ). It lay on the left bank of the Euphrates, about 120 miles south-east of Babylon, and is now represented by the mounds and ruins of Warka. It appears to have been the necropolis of the Assyrian kings, as the whole region is strewed with bricks and the remains of coffins. "Standing on the summit of the principal edifice, called the Buwarizza, a tower 200 feet square in the centre of the ruins, the beholder is struck with astonishment at the enormous accumulation of mounds and ancient relics at his feet. An irregular circle, nearly 6 miles in circumference, is defined by the traces of an earthen rampart, in some places 40 feet high."  </p>
Esaias	<p>the Greek form for Isaiah, constantly used in the Authorized Version of the New Testament ( Matthew 3:3 ;  4:14 ), but in the Revised Version always "Isaiah."  </p>
Esarhaddon	<p>Assur has given a brother, successor of Sennacherib ( 2 Kings 19:37 ;  Isaiah 37:38 ). He ascended the throne about B.C. 681. Nothing further is recorded of him in Scripture, except that he settled certain colonists in Samaria ( Ezra 4:2 ). But from the monuments it appears that he was the most powerful of all the Assyrian monarchs. He built many temples and palaces, the most magnificent of which was the south-west palace at Nimrud, which is said to have been in its general design almost the same as Solomon's palace, only much larger ( 1 Kings 7:1-12 ).  </p><p> In December B.C. 681Sennacherib was murdered by two of his sons, who, after holding Nineveh for forty-two days, were compelled to fly to Erimenas of Ararat, or Armenia. Their brother Esarhaddon, who had been engaged in a campaign against Armenia, led his army against them. They were utterly overthrown in a battle fought April B.C. 680, near Malatiyeh, and in the following month Esarhaddon was crowned at Nineveh. He restored Babylon, conquered Egypt, and received tribute from Manasseh of Judah. He died in October B.C. 668, while on the march to suppress an Egyptian revolt, and was succeeded by his son Assur-bani-pal, whose younger brother was made viceroy of Babylonia.  </p>
Esau	<p>hairy, Rebekah's first-born twin son ( Genesis 25:25 ). The name of Edom, "red", was also given to him from his conduct in connection with the red lentil "pottage" for which he sold his birthright (30,31). The circumstances connected with his birth foreshadowed the enmity which afterwards subsisted between the twin brothers and the nations they founded ( Genesis 25:22 Genesis 25:23 Genesis 25:26 ). In process of time Jacob, following his natural bent, became a shepherd; while Esau, a "son of the desert," devoted himself to the perilous and toilsome life of a huntsman. On a certain occasion, on returning from the chase, urged by the cravings of hunger, Esau sold his birthright to his brother, Jacob, who thereby obtained the covenant blessing ( Genesis 27:28 Genesis 27:29 Genesis 27:36 ;  Hebrews 12:16 Hebrews 12:17 ). He afterwards tried to regain what he had so recklessly parted with, but was defeated in his attempts through the stealth of his brother ( Genesis 27:4 Genesis 27:34 Genesis 27:38 ).  </p><p> At the age of forty years, to the great grief of his parents, he married ( Genesis 26:34 Genesis 26:35 ) two Canaanitish maidens, Judith, the daughter of Beeri, and Bashemath, the daughter of Elon. When Jacob was sent away to Padan-aram, Esau tried to conciliate his parents ( Genesis 28:8 Genesis 28:9 ) by marrying his cousin Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael. This led him to cast in his lot with the Ishmaelite tribes; and driving the Horites out of Mount Seir, he settled in that region. After some thirty years' sojourn in Padan-aram Jacob returned to Canaan, and was reconciled to Esau, who went forth to meet him ( 33:4 ). Twenty years after this, Isaac their father died, when the two brothers met, probably for the last time, beside his grave ( 35:29 ). Esau now permanently left Canaan, and established himself as a powerful and wealthy chief in the land of Edom (q.v.).  </p><p> Long after this, when the descendants of Jacob came out of Egypt, the Edomites remembered the old quarrel between the brothers, and with fierce hatred they warred against Israel. </p>
Eschew	<p>from old French eschever, "to flee from" ( Job 1:1 Job 1:8 ;  2:3 ;  1 Peter 3:11 ).  </p>
Esdraelon	<p>the Greek form of the Hebrew "Jezreel," the name of the great plain (called by the natives Merj Ibn Amer; i.e., "the meadow of the son of Amer") which stretches across Central Palestine from the Jordan to the Mediterraanean, separating the mountain ranges of Carmel and Samaria from those of Galilee, extending about 14 miles from north to south, and 9 miles from east to west. It is drained by "that ancient river" the Kishon, which flows westward to the Mediterranean. From the foot of Mount Tabor it branches out into three valleys, that on the north passing between Tabor and Little Hermon ( Judges 4:14 ); that on the south between Mount Gilboa and En-gannim ( 2 Kings 9:27 ); while the central portion, the "valley of Jezreel" proper, runs into the Jordan valley (which is about 1,000 feet lower than Esdraelon) by Bethshean. Here Gideon gained his great victory over the Midianites (Judg.  7:1-25 ). Here also Barak defeated Sisera, and Saul's army was defeated by the Philistines, and king Josiah, while fighting in disguise against Necho, king of Egypt, was slain ( 2 Chronicles 35:20-27 ;  2 Kings  <span class="badLink">2329</span> -29). This plain has been well called the "battle-field of Palestine." "It has been a chosen place for encampment in every contest carried on in this country, from the days of Nebuchadnezzar, king of the Assyrians, in the history of whose wars with Arphaxad it is mentioned as the Great Plain of Esdraelon, until the disastrous march of Napoleon Bonaparte from Egypt into Syria. Jews, Gentiles, Saracens, Crusaders, Frenchmen, Egyptians, Persians, Druses, Turks, and Arabs, warriors out of every nation which is under heaven, have pitched their tents in the plain, and have beheld the various banners of their nations wet with the dews of Tabor and Hermon" (Dr. Clark).  </p>
Esek	<p>quarrel, a well which Isaac's herdsmen dug in the valley of Gerar, and so called because the herdsmen of Gerar quarrelled with them for its possession ( Genesis 26:20 ).  </p>
Eshbaal	<p>man of Baal, the fourth son of king Saul ( 1 Chronicles 8:33 ;  9:39 ). He is also called Ish-bosheth (q.v.),  2 Samuel 2:8 .  </p>
Eshcol	<p>bunch; brave. </p><li> A young Amoritish chief who joined Abraham in the recovery of Lot from the hands of Chedorlaomer ( Genesis 14:13 Genesis 14:24 ).  </li><li> A valley in which the spies obtained a fine cluster of grapes ( Numbers 13:23 Numbers 13:24 ; "the brook Eshcol," A.V.; "the valley of Eshcol," RSV), which they took back with them to the camp of Israel as a specimen of the fruits of the Promised Land. On their way back they explored the route which led into the south (the Negeb) by the western edge of the mountains at Telilat el-'Anab, i.e., "grape-mounds", near Beersheba. "In one of these extensive valleys, perhaps in Wady Hanein, where miles of grape-mounds even now meet the eye, they cut the gigantic clusters of grapes, and gathered the pomegranates and figs, to show how goodly was the land which the Lord had promised for their inheritance.", Palmer's Desert of the Exodus.   </li>
Eshean	<p>a place in the mountains of Judah (Josh.15:52), supposed to be the ruin es-Simia, near Dumah, south of Hebron.  </p>
Eshtaol	<p>narrow pass or recess, a town ( Joshua 15:33 ) in the low country, the She-phelah of Judah. It was allotted to the tribe of Dan ( Joshua 19:41 ), and was one of their strongholds. Here Samson spent his boyhood, and first began to show his mighty strength; and here he was buried in the burying-place of Manoah his father ( Judges 13:25 ;  16:31 ;  Judges 18:2 Judges 18:8 Judges 18:11 Judges 18:12 ). It is identified with the modern Yeshua, on a hill 2 miles east of Zorah. Others, however, identify it with Kustul, east of Kirjath-jearim.  </p>
Eshtemoa	<p>obedience, a town in the mountains of Judah ( Joshua 21:14 ;  1 Chronicles 6:57 ), which was allotted, with the land round it, to the priests. It was frequented by David and his followers during their wanderings; and he sent presents of the spoil of the Amalekites to his friends there ( 1 Samuel 30:28 ). It is identified with es-Semu'a, a village about 3 1/2 miles east of Socoh, and 7 or 8 miles south of Hebron, around which there are ancient remains of the ruined city. It is the centre of the "south country" or Negeb. It is also called "Eshtemoh" ( Joshua 15:50 ).  </p>
Espouse	<p>( 2 Samuel 3:14 ), to betroth. The espousal was a ceremony of betrothing, a formal agreement between the parties then coming under obligation for the purpose of marriage. Espousals are in the East frequently contracted years before the marriage is celebrated. It is referred to as figuratively illustrating the relations between God and his people ( Jeremiah 2:2 ;  Matthew 1:18 ;  2 co  11:2 ). (See BETROTH .) </p>
Essenes	<p>a Jewish mystical sect somewhat resembling the Pharisees. They affected great purity. They originated about B.C. 100, and disappeared from history after the destruction of Jerusalem. They are not directly mentioned in Scripture, although they may be referred to in  Matthew 19:11 Matthew 19:12 ,  Colossians 2:8 Colossians 2:18 Colossians 2:23 .  </p>
Esther	<p>the queen of Ahasuerus, and heroine of the book that bears her name. She was a Jewess named Hadas'sah (the myrtle), but when she entered the royal harem she received the name by which she henceforth became known ( Esther 2:7 ). It is a Syro-Arabian modification of the Persian word satarah, which means a star. She was the daughter of Abihail, a Benjamite. Her family did not avail themselves of the permission granted by Cyrus to the exiles to return to Jerusalem; and she resided with her cousin Mordecai, who held some office in the household of the Persian king at "Shushan in the palace." Ahasuerus having divorced Vashti, chose Esther to be his wife. Soon after this he gave Haman the Agagite, his prime minister, power and authority to kill and extirpate all the Jews throughout the Persian empire. By the interposition of Esther this terrible catastrophe was averted. Haman was hanged on the gallows he had intended for Mordecai ( Esther 7 ); and the Jews established an annual feast, the feast of Purim (q.v.), in memory of their wonderful deliverance. This took place about fifty-two years after the Return, the year of the great battles of Plataea and Mycale (B.C. 479).  </p><p> Esther appears in the Bible as a "woman of deep piety, faith, courage, patriotism, and caution, combined with resolution; a dutiful daughter to her adopted father, docile and obedient to his counsels, and anxious to share the king's favour with him for the good of the Jewish people. There must have been a singular grace and charm in her aspect and manners, since 'she obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her' ( Esther 2:15 ). That she was raised up as an instrument in the hand of God to avert the destruction of the Jewish people, and to afford them protection and forward their wealth and peace in their captivity, is also manifest from the Scripture account."  </p>
Esther, Book of	<p>The authorship of this book is unknown. It must have been obviously written after the death of Ahasuerus (the Xerxes of the Greeks), which took place B.C. 465. The minute and particular account also given of many historical details makes it probable that the writer was contemporary with Mordecai and Esther. Hence we may conclude that the book was written probably about B.C. 444-434, and that the author was one of the Jews of the dispersion.  </p><p> This book is more purely historical than any other book of Scripture; and it has this remarkable peculiarity that the name of God does not occur in it from first to last in any form. It has, however, been well observed that "though the name of God be not in it, his finger is." The book wonderfully exhibits the providential government of God. </p>
Etam	<p>eyrie. </p><li> A village of the tribe of Simeon ( 1 Chronicles 4:32 ). Into some cleft ("top," A.V.,; RSV, "cleft") of a rock here Samson retired after his slaughter of the Philistines ( Judges 15:8 Judges 15:11 ). It was a natural stronghold. It has been identified with Beit 'Atab, west of Bethlehem, near Zorah and Eshtaol. On the crest of a rocky knoll, under the village, is a long tunnel, which may be the "cleft" in which Samson hid.  </li><li> A city of Judah, fortified by Rehoboam ( 2 Chronicles 11:6 ). It was near Bethlehem and Tekoah, and some distance apparently to the north of (1). It seems to have been in the district called Nephtoah (or Netophah), where were the sources of the water from which Solomon's gardens and pleasure-grounds and pools, as well as Bethlehem and the temple, were supplied. It is now 'Ain 'Atan, at the head of the Wady Urtas, a fountain sending forth a copious supply of pure water.   </li>
Eternal death	<p>The miserable fate of the wicked in hell ( Matthew 25:46 ;  Mark 3:29 ;  Hebrews 6:2 ;  2 th  1:9 ;  Matthew 18:8 ;  25:41 ;  Jude 1:7 ). The Scripture as clearly teaches the unending duration of the penal sufferings of the lost as the "everlasting life," the "eternal life" of the righteous. The same Greek words in the New Testament (aion, aionios, aidios) are used to express (1) the eternal existence of God ( 1 Timothy 1:17 ;  Romans 1:20 ;  16:26 ); (2) of Christ ( Revelation 1:18 ); (3) of the Holy Ghost ( Hebrews 9:14 ); and (4) the eternal duration of the sufferings of the lost ( Matthew 25:46 ;  Jude 1:6 ).  </p><p> Their condition after casting off the mortal body is spoken of in these expressive words: "Fire that shall not be quenched" ( Mark 9:45  Mark 9:46 ), "fire unquenchable" ( Luke 3:17 ), "the worm that never dies," the "bottomless pit" ( Revelation 9:1 ), "the smoke of their torment ascending up for ever and ever" ( Revelation 14:10 Revelation 14:11 ).  </p><p> The idea that the "second death" ( Revelation 20:14 ) is in the case of the wicked their absolute destruction, their annihilation, has not the slightest support from Scripture, which always represents their future as one of conscious suffering enduring for ever.  </p><p> The supposition that God will ultimately secure the repentance and restoration of all sinners is equally unscriptural. There is not the slightest trace in all the Scriptures of any such restoration. Sufferings of themselves have no tendency to purify the soul from sin or impart spiritual life. The atoning death of Christ and the sanctifying power of the Holy Spirit are the only means of divine appointment for bringing men to repentance. Now in the case of them that perish these means have been rejected, and "there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins" ( Hebrews 10:26 Hebrews 10:27 ).  </p>
Eternal life	<p>This expression occurs in the Old Testament only in  Daniel 12:2  (RSV, "everlasting life").  </p><p> It occurs frequently in the New Testament ( Matthew 7:14 ;  Matthew 18:8 Matthew 18:9 ;  Luke 10:28 ; comp  18:18 ). It comprises the whole future of the redeemed ( Luke 16:9 ), and is opposed to "eternal punishment" ( Matthew 19:29 ;  25:46 ). It is the final reward and glory into which the children of God enter ( 1 Timothy 6:12 1 Timothy 6:19 ;  Romans 6:22 ;  Galatians 6:8 ;  1 Timothy 1:16 ;  Romans 5:21 ); their Sabbath of rest ( Hebrews 4:9 ; comp  12:22 ).  </p><p> The newness of life which the believer derives from Christ ( Romans 6:4 ) is the very essence of salvation, and hence the life of glory or the eternal life must also be theirs ( Romans 6:8 ;  2 Tim  Romans 2:11 Romans 2:12 ;  Romans 5:17 Romans 5:21 ;  8:30 ;  Ephesians 2:5 Ephesians 2:6 ). It is the "gift of God in Jesus Christ our Lord" ( Romans 6:23 ). The life the faithful have here on earth ( John 3:36 ;  5:24 ;  John 6:47 John 6:53-58 ) is inseparably connected with the eternal life beyond, the endless life of the future, the happy future of the saints in heaven ( Matthew 19:16 Matthew 19:29 ;  25:46 ).  </p>
Etham	<p>perhaps another name for Khetam, or "fortress," on the Shur or great wall of Egypt, which extended from the Mediterranean to the Gulf of Suez. Here the Israelites made their third encampment ( Exodus 13:20 ;  Numbers 33:6 ). The camp was probably a little to the west of the modern town of Ismailia. Here the Israelites were commanded to change their route ( Exodus 14:2 ), and "turn" towards the south, and encamp before Pi-hahiroth. (See EXODUS;  PITHOM .) </p>
Ethan	<p>firm. </p><li> "The Ezrahite," distinguished for his wisdom ( 1 Kings 4:31 ). He is named as the author of the 89th Psalm. He was of the tribe of Levi.  </li><li> A Levite of the family of Merari, one of the leaders of the temple music ( 1 Chronicles 6:44 ;  1 Chronicles 15:17 1 Chronicles 15:19 ). He was probably the same as Jeduthun. He is supposed by some to be the same also as (1).   </li>
Ethanim	<p>the month of gifts, i.e., of vintage offerings; called Tisri after the Exile; corresponding to part of September and October. It was the first month of the civil year, and the seventh of the sacred year ( 1 Kings 8:2 ).  </p>
Eth-baal	<p>with Baal, a king of Sidon (B.C. 940-908), father of Jezebel, who was the wife of Ahab ( 1 Kings 16:31 ). He is said to have been also a priest of Astarte, whose worship was closely allied to that of Baal, and this may account for his daughter's zeal in promoting idolatry in Israel. This marriage of Ahab was most fatal to both Israel and Judah. Dido, the founder of Carthage, was his granddaughter.  </p>
Ethiopia	<p>country of burnt faces; the Greek word by which the Hebrew Cush is rendered ( Genesis 2:13 ;  2 Kings  19:9 ;  Esther 1:1 ;  Job 28:19 ;  Psalms 68:31 ;  87:4 ), a country which lay to the south of Egypt, beginning at Syene on the First Cataract ( Ezekiel 29:10 ;  30:6 ), and extending to beyond the confluence of the White and Blue Nile. It corresponds generally with what is now known as the Soudan (i.e., the land of the blacks). This country was known to the Hebrews, and is described in  Isaiah 18:1 ;  Zephaniah 3:10 . They carried on some commercial intercourse with it ( Isaiah 45:14 ).  </p><p> Its inhabitants were descendants of Ham ( Genesis 10:6 ;  Jeremiah 13:23 ;  Isaiah 18:2 , "scattered and peeled," A.V.; but in RSV, "tall and smooth"). Herodotus, the Greek historian, describes them as "the tallest and handsomest of men." They are frequently represented on Egyptian monuments, and they are all of the type of the true negro. As might be expected, the history of this country is interwoven with that of Egypt.  </p><p> Ethiopia is spoken of in prophecy ( Psalms 68:31 ;  87:4 ;  Isaiah 45:14 ;  Ezekiel 30:4-9 ;  Daniel 11:43 ;  Nahum 3:8-10 ;  Habakkuk 3:7 ;  Zephaniah 2:12 ).  </p>
Ethiopian eunuch	<p>the chief officer or prime minister of state of Candace (q.v.), queen of Ethiopia. He was converted to Christianity through the instrumentality of Philip (Act  8:27 ). The northern portion of Ethiopia formed the kingdom of Meroe, which for a long period was ruled over by queens, and it was probably from this kingdom that the eunuch came.  </p>
Ethiopian woman	<p>the wife of Moses ( Numbers 12:1 ). It is supposed that Zipporah, Moses' first wife ( Exodus 2:21 ), was now dead. His marriage of this "woman" descended from Ham gave offence to Aaron and Miriam.  </p>
Eunice	<p>happily conquering, the mother of Timothy, a believing Jewess, but married to a Greek ( Acts 16:1 ). She trained her son from his childhood in the knowledge of the Scriptures ( 2 Timothy 3:15 ). She was distinguished by her "unfeigned faith."  </p>
Eunuch	<p>literally bed-keeper or chamberlain, and not necessarily in all cases one who was mutilated, although the practice of employing such mutilated persons in Oriental courts was common ( 2 Kings 9:32 ;  Esther 2:3 ). The law of Moses excluded them from the congregation ( Deuteronomy 23:1 ). They were common also among the Greeks and Romans. It is said that even to-day there are some in Rome who are employed in singing soprano in the Sistine Chapel. Three classes of eunuchs are mentioned in  Matthew 19:12 .  </p>
Euodias	<p>a good journey, a female member of the church at Philippi. She was one who laboured much with Paul in the gospel. He exhorts her to be of one mind with Syntyche (Phil  4:2 ). From this it seems they had been at variance with each other.  </p>
Euphrates	<p>Hebrew, Perath; Assyrian, Purat; Persian cuneiform, Ufratush, whence Greek Euphrates, meaning "sweet water." The Assyrian name means "the stream," or "the great stream." It is generally called in the Bible simply "the river" ( Exodus 23:31 ), or "the great river" ( Deuteronomy 1:7 ).  </p><p> The Euphrates is first mentioned in  Genesis 2:14  as one of the rivers of Paradise. It is next mentioned in connection with the covenant which God entered into with Abraham ( 15:18 ), when he promised to his descendants the land from the river of Egypt to the river Euphrates (Compare  Deuteronomy 11:24 ;  Joshua 1:4 ), a covenant promise afterwards fulfilled in the extended conquests of David ( 2 Samuel 8:2-14 ;  1 Chronicles 18:3 ;  1 Kings 4:24 ). It was then the boundary of the kingdom to the north-east. In the ancient history of Assyria, and Babylon, and Egypt many events are recorded in which mention is made of the "great river." Just as the Nile represented in prophecy the power of Egypt, so the Euphrates represented the Assyrian power ( Isaiah 8:7 ;  Jeremiah 2:18 ).  </p><p> It is by far the largest and most important of all the rivers of Western Asia. From its source in the Armenian mountains to the Persian Gulf, into which it empties itself, it has a course of about 1,700 miles. It has two sources, (1) the Frat or Kara-su (i.e., "the black river"), which rises 25 miles north-east of Erzeroum; and (2) the Muradchai (i.e., "the river of desire"), which rises near Ararat, on the northern slope of Ala-tagh. At Kebban Maden, 400 miles from the source of the former, and 270 from that of the latter, they meet and form the majestic stream, which is at length joined by the Tigris at Koornah, after which it is called Shat-el-Arab, which runs in a deep and broad stream for above 140 miles to the sea. It is estimated that the alluvium brought down by these rivers encroaches on the sea at the rate of about one mile in thirty years.  </p>
Euroclydon	<p>south-east billow, the name of the wind which blew in the Adriatic Gulf, and which struck the ship in which Paul was wrecked on the coast of Malta ( Acts 27:14 ; RSV, "Euraquilo," i.e., north-east wind). It is called a "tempestuous wind," i.e., as literally rendered, a "typhonic wind," or a typhoon. It is the modern Gregalia or Levanter. (Compare  Jonah 1:4 .)  </p>
Eutychus	<p>fortunate, ( Acts 20:9-12 ), a young man of Troas who fell through drowsiness from the open window of the third floor of the house where Paul was preaching, and was "taken up dead." The lattice-work of the window being open to admit the air, the lad fell out and down to the court below. Paul restored him to life again. (Compare  1 Kings 17:21 ;  2 Kings  4:34 .)  </p>
Evangelist	<p>a "publisher of glad tidings;" a missionary preacher of the gospel ( Ephesians 4:11 ). This title is applied to Philip ( Acts 21:8 ), who appears to have gone from city to city preaching the word ( Acts 8:4 Acts 8:40 ). Judging from the case of Philip, evangelists had neither the authority of an apostle, nor the gift of prophecy, nor the responsibility of pastoral supervision over a portion of the flock. They were itinerant preachers, having it as their special function to carry the gospel to places where it was previously unknown. The writers of the four Gospels are known as the Evangelists.  </p>
Eve	<p>life; living, the name given by Adam to his wife ( Genesis 3:20 ;  4:1 ). The account of her creation is given in  Genesis 2:21 Genesis 2:22 . The Creator, by declaring that it was not good for man to be alone, and by creating for him a suitable companion, gave sanction to monogamy. The commentator Matthew Henry says: "This companion was taken from his side to signify that she was to be dear unto him as his own flesh. Not from his head, lest she should rule over him; nor from his feet, lest he should tyrannize over her; but from his side, to denote that species of equality which is to subsist in the marriage state." And again, "That wife that is of God's making by special grace, and of God's bringing by special providence, is likely to prove a helpmeet to her husband." Through the subtle temptation of the serpent she violated the commandment of God by taking of the forbidden fruit, which she gave also unto her husband ( 1 Timothy 2:13-15 ;  2 co  11:3 ). When she gave birth to her first son, she said, "I have gotten a man from the Lord" (RSV, "I have gotten a man with the help of the Lord,"  Genesis 4:1 ). Thus she welcomed Cain, as some think, as if he had been the Promised One the "See d of the woman."  </p>
Evening	<p>the period following sunset with which the Jewish day began ( Genesis 1:5 ;  Mark 13:35 ). The Hebrews reckoned two evenings of each day, as appears from  Exodus 16:12 :  30:8 ;  12:6  (marg.);  Leviticus 23:5  (marg. RSV, "between the two evenings"). The "first evening" was that period when the sun was verging towards setting, and the "second evening" the moment of actual sunset. The word "evenings" in  Jeremiah 5:6  should be "deserts" (marg. RSV).  </p>
Everlasting	<p>eternal, applied to God ( Genesis 21:33 ;  Deuteronomy 33:27 ;  Psalms 41:13 ;  90:2 ). We also read of the "everlasting hills" ( Genesis 49:26 ); an "everlasting priesthood" ( Exodus 40:15 ;  Numbers 25:13 ). (See ETERNAL .) </p>
Evil eye	<p>( Proverbs 23:6 ), figuratively, the envious or covetous. (Compare  Deuteronomy 15:9 ;  Matthew 20:15 .)  </p>
Evil-merodach	<p>Merodach's man, the son and successor of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon ( 2 Kings 25:27 ;  Jeremiah 52:31 Jeremiah 52:34 ). He seems to have reigned but two years (B.C. 562-560). Influenced probably by Daniel, he showed kindness to Jehoiachin, who had been a prisoner in Babylon for thirty-seven years. He released him, and "spoke kindly to him." He was murdered by Nergal-sharezer=Neriglissar, his brother-in-law, who succeeded him ( Jeremiah 39:3 Jeremiah 39:13 ).  </p>
Evil-speaking	<p>is expressly forbidden ( Titus 3:2 ;  James 4:11 ), and severe punishments are denounced against it ( 1 Corinthians 5:11 ;  6:10 ). It is spoken of also with abhorrence ( Psalms 15:3 ;  Proverbs 18:6 Proverbs 18:7 ), and is foreign to the whole Christian character and the example of Christ.  </p>
Example	<p>of Christ ( 1 Peter 2:21 ;  John 13:15 ); of pastors to their flocks (Phil  3:17 ;  2 th  3:9 ;  1 Timothy 4:12 ;  1 Peter 5:3 ); of the Jews as a warning ( Hebrews 4:11 ); of the prophets as suffering affliction ( James 5:10 ).  </p>
Executioner	<p>( Mark 6:27 ). Instead of the Greek word, Mark here uses a Latin word, speculator, which literally means "a scout," "a spy," and at length came to denote one of the armed bodyguard of the emperor. Herod Antipas, in imitation of the emperor, had in attendance on him a company of speculatores. They were sometimes employed as executioners, but this was a mere accident of their office. (See MARK, GOSPEL  OF .) </p>
Exercise, bodily	<p>( 1 Timothy 4:8 ). An ascetic mortification of the flesh and denial of personal gratification (Compare  Colossians 2:23 ) to which some sects of the Jews, especially the Essenes, attached importance.  </p>
Exile	<p></p><li> Of the kingdom of Israel. In the time of Pekah, Tiglath-pileser II. carried away captive into Assyria ( 2 Kings 15:29 ; Compare  Isaiah 10:5 Isaiah 10:6 ) a part of the inhabitants of Galilee and of Gilead (B.C. 741).  <p> After the destruction of Samaria (B.C. 720) by Shalmaneser and Sargon (q.v.), there was a general deportation of the Israelites into Mesopotamia and Media ( 2 Kings 17:6 ;  18:9 ;  1 Chronicles 5:26 ). (See ISRAEL, KINGDOM  OF .) </p></li><li> Of the kingdom of the two tribes, the kingdom of Judah. Nebuchadnezzar, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim ( Jeremiah 25:1 ), invaded Judah, and carried away some royal youths, including Daniel and his companions (B.C. 606), together with the sacred vessels of the temple ( 2 Chronicles 36:7 ;  Daniel 1:2 ). In B.C. 598 ( Jeremiah 52:28 ;  2 Kings  24:12 ), in the beginning of Jehoiachin's reign ( 2 Kings 24:8 ), Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive 3,023 eminent Jews, including the king ( 2 Chronicles 36:10 ), with his family and officers ( 2 Kings 24:12 ), and a large number of warriors (16), with very many persons of note (14), and artisans (16), leaving behind only those who were poor and helpless. This was the first general deportation to Babylon.  <p> In B.C. 588, after the revolt of Zedekiah (q.v.), there was a second general deportation of Jews by Nebuchadnezzar ( Jeremiah 52:29 ;  2 Kings  25:8 ), including 832 more of the principal men of the kingdom. He carried away also the rest of the sacred vessels ( 2 Chronicles 36:18 ). From this period, when the temple was destroyed ( 2 Kings 25:9 ), to the complete restoration, B.C. 517 ( Ezra 6:15 ), is the period of the "seventy years."  </p><p> In B.C. 582 occurred the last and final deportation. The entire number Nebuchadnezzar carried captive was 4,600 heads of families with their wives and children and dependants ( Jeremiah 52:30 ;  43:5-7 ;  2 Chr  36:20 , etc.). Thus the exiles formed a very considerable community in Babylon.  </p><p> When Cyrus granted permission to the Jews to return to their own land ( Ezra 1:5 ;  7:13 ), only a comparatively small number at first availed themselves of the privilege. It cannot be questioned that many belonging to the kingdom of Israel ultimately joined the Jews under Ezra, Zerubbabel, and Nehemiah, and returned along with them to Jerusalem ( Jeremiah 50:4 Jeremiah 50:5 Jeremiah 50:17-20 Jeremiah 50:33-35 ).  </p><p> Large numbers had, however, settled in the land of Babylon, and formed numerous colonies in different parts of the kingdom. Their descendants very probably have spread far into Eastern lands and become absorbed in the general population. (See JUDAH, KINGDOM OF; CAPTIVITY .) </p> </li>
Exodus	<p>the great deliverance wrought for the children of Isreal when they were brought out of the land of Egypt with "a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm" ( Exodus 12:51 ;  Deuteronomy 26:8 ;  Psalms 114 ;  136 ), about B.C. 1490, and four hundred and eighty years ( 1 Kings 6:1 ) before the building of Solomon's temple.  </p><p> The time of their sojourning in Egypt was, according to  Exodus 12:40 , the space of four hundred and thirty years. In the LXX., the words are, "The sojourning of the children of Israel which they sojourned in Egypt and in the land of Canaan was four hundred and thirty years;" and the Samaritan version reads, "The sojourning of the children of Israel and of their fathers which they sojourned in the land of Canaan and in the land of Egypt was four hundred and thirty years." In  Genesis 15:13-16 , the period is prophetically given (in round numbers) as four hundred years. This passage is quoted by Stephen in his defence before the council ( Acts 7:6 ).  </p><p> The chronology of the "sojourning" is variously estimated. Those who adopt the longer term reckon thus: </p><p> |                          Years | |    From the descent of Jacob into Egypt to the |     death of Joseph               71 | |    From the death of Joseph to the birth of |     Moses                    278 | |    From the birth of Moses to his flight into |     Midian                    40 | |    From the flight of Moses to his return into |     Egypt                    40 | |    From the return of Moses to the Exodus     1 | |                           430  </p><p> Others contend for the shorter period of two hundred and fifteen years, holding that the period of four hundred and thirty years comprehends the years from the entrance of Abraham into Canaan (see LXX. and Samaritan) to the descent of Jacob into Egypt. They reckon thus: </p><p> |                          Years | |    From Abraham's arrival in Canaan to Isaac's |     birth                    25 | |    From Isaac's birth to that of his twin sons |     Esau and Jacob                60 | |    From Jacob's birth to the going down into |     Egypt                    130 | |                          (215) | |    From Jacob's going down into Egypt to the |     death of Joseph               71 | |    From death of Joseph to the birth of Moses   64 | |    From birth of Moses to the Exodus       80 | |                      In all... 430  </p><p> During the forty years of Moses' sojourn in the land of Midian, the Hebrews in Egypt were being gradually prepared for the great national crisis which was approaching. The plagues that successively fell upon the land loosened the bonds by which Pharaoh held them in slavery, and at length he was eager that they should depart. But the Hebrews must now also be ready to go. They were poor; for generations they had laboured for the Egyptians without wages. They asked gifts from their neighbours around them ( Exodus 12:35 ), and these were readily bestowed. And then, as the first step towards their independent national organization, they observed the feast of the Passover, which was now instituted as a perpetual memorial. The blood of the paschal lamb was duly sprinkled on the door-posts and lintels of all their houses, and they were all within, waiting the next movement in the working out of God's plan. At length the last stroke fell on the land of Egypt. "It came to pass, that at midnight Jehovah smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt." Pharaoh rose up in the night, and called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, "Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve Jehovah, as ye have said. Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also." Thus was Pharaoh (q.v.) completely humbled and broken down. These words he spoke to Moses and Aaron "seem to gleam through the tears of the humbled king, as he lamented his son snatched from him by so sudden a death, and tremble with a sense of the helplessness which his proud soul at last felt when the avenging hand of God had visited even his palace."  </p><p> The terror-stricken Egyptians now urged the instant departure of the Hebrews. In the midst of the Passover feast, before the dawn of the 15th day of the month Abib (our April nearly), which was to be to them henceforth the beginning of the year, as it was the commencement of a new epoch in their history, every family, with all that appertained to it, was ready for the march, which instantly began under the leadership of the heads of tribes with their various sub-divisions. They moved onward, increasing as they went forward from all the districts of Goshen, over the whole of which they were scattered, to the common centre. Three or four days perhaps elapsed before the whole body of the people were assembled at Rameses, and ready to set out under their leader Moses ( Exodus 12:37 ;  Numbers 33:3 ). This city was at that time the residence of the Egyptian court, and here the interviews between Moses and Pharaoh had taken place.  </p><p> From Rameses they journeyed to Succoth ( Exodus 12:37 ), identified with Tel-el-Maskhuta, about 12 miles west of Ismailia. (See PITHOM .) Their third station was Etham (q.v.),  13:20 , "in the edge of the wilderness," and was probably a little to the west of the modern town of Ismailia, on the Suez Canal. Here they were commanded "to turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea", i.e., to change their route from east to due south. The Lord now assumed the direction of their march in the pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night. They were then led along the west shore of the Red Sea till they came to an extensive camping-ground "before Pi-hahiroth," about 40 miles from Etham. This distance from Etham may have taken three days to traverse, for the number of camping-places by no means indicates the number of days spent on the journey: e.g., it took fully a month to travel from Rameses to the wilderness of Sin ( Exodus 16:1 ), yet reference is made to only six camping-places during all that time. The exact spot of their encampment before they crossed the Red Sea cannot be determined. It was probably somewhere near the present site of Suez.  </p><p> Under the direction of God the children of Israel went "forward" from the camp "before Pi-hahiroth," and the sea opened a pathway for them, so that they crossed to the farther shore in safety. The Egyptian host pursued after them, and, attempting to follow through the sea, were overwhelmed in its returning waters, and thus the whole military force of the Egyptians perished. They "sank as lead in the mighty waters" ( Exodus 15:1-9 ; Compare  Psalms 77:16-19 ).  </p><p> Having reached the eastern shore of the sea, perhaps a little way to the north of 'Ayun Musa ("the springs of Moses"), there they encamped and rested probably for a day. Here Miriam and the other women sang the triumphal song recorded in  Exodus 15:1-21 .  </p><p> From 'Ayun Musa they went on for three days through a part of the barren "wilderness of Shur" (22), called also the "wilderness of Etham" ( Numbers 33:8 ; Compare  Exodus 13:20 ), without finding water. On the last of these days they came to Marah (q.v.), where the "bitter" water was by a miracle made drinkable.  </p><p> Their next camping-place was Elim (q.v.), where were twelve springs of water and a grove of "threescore and ten" palm trees ( Exodus 15:27 ).  </p><p> After a time the children of Israel "took their journey from Elim," and encamped by the Red Sea ( Numbers 33:10 ), and thence removed to the "wilderness of Sin" (to be distinguished from the wilderness of Zin,  20:1 ), where they again encamped. Here, probably the modern el-Markha, the supply of bread they had brought with them out of Egypt failed. They began to "murmur" for want of bread. God "heard their murmurings" and gave them quails and manna, "bread from heaven" ( Exodus 16:4-36 ). Moses directed that an omer of manna should be put aside and preserved as a perpetual memorial of God's goodness. They now turned inland, and after three encampments came to the rich and fertile valley of Rephidim, in the Wady Feiran. Here they found no water, and again murmured against Moses. Directed by God, Moses procured a miraculous supply of water from the "rock in Horeb," one of the hills of the Sinai group ( 17:1-7 ); and shortly afterwards the children of Israel here fought their first battle with the Amalekites, whom they smote with the edge of the sword.  </p><p> From the eastern extremity of the Wady Feiran the line of march now probably led through the Wady esh-Sheikh and the Wady Solaf, meeting in the Wady er-Rahah, "the enclosed plain in front of the magnificient cliffs of Ras Sufsafeh." Here they encamped for more than a year ( Numbers 1:1 ;  10:11 ) before Sinai (q.v.).  </p><p> The different encampments of the children of Israel, from the time of their leaving Egypt till they reached the Promised Land, are mentioned in  Exodus 12:37-19 ;  Numbers 1021 -21;  33 ; De 1,2,10.  </p><p> It is worthy of notice that there are unmistakable evidences that the Egyptians had a tradition of a great exodus from their country, which could be none other than the exodus of the Hebrews. </p>
Exodus, Book of	<p>Exodus is the name given in the LXX. to the second book of the Pentateuch (q.v.). It means "departure" or "outgoing." This name was adopted in the Latin translation, and thence passed into other languages. The Hebrews called it by the first words, according to their custom, Ve-eleh shemoth (i.e., "and these are the names"). </p><p> It contains, </p><li> An account of the increase and growth of the Israelites in Egypt (ch. 1) </li><li> Preparations for their departure out of Egypt ( (2-12:36). ). </li><li> Their journeyings from Egypt to Sinai ( (12:37-19:2). ). </li><li> The giving of the law and the establishment of the institutions by which the organization of the people was completed, the theocracy, "a kingdom of priest and an holy nation" (19:3-ch. 40).  <p> The time comprised in this book, from the death of Joseph to the erection of the tabernacle in the wilderness, is about one hundred and forty-five years, on the supposition that the four hundred and thirty years ( <span class="badLink">12:40</span> ) are to be computed from the time of the promises made to Abraham ( Galatians 3:17 ).  </p><p> The authorship of this book, as well as of that of the other books of the Pentateuch, is to be ascribed to Moses. The unanimous voice of tradition and all internal evidences abundantly support this opinion. </p> </li>
Exorcist	<p>( Acts 19:13 ). "In that sceptical and therefore superstitious age professional exorcist abounded. Many of these professional exorcists were disreputable Jews, like Simon in Samaria and Elymas in Cyprus ( 8:9 ;  13:6 )." Other references to exorcism as practised by the Jews are found in  Matthew 12:27 ;  Mark 9:38 ;  Luke 9:49 Luke 9:50 . It would seem that it was an opinion among the Jews that miracles might be wrought by invoking the divine name. Thus also these "vagabond Jews" pretended that they could expel daemons.  </p><p> The power of casting out devils was conferred by Christ on his apostles ( Matthew 10:8 ), and on the seventy ( Luke 10:17-19 ), and was exercised by believers after his ascension ( Mark 16:17 ;  Acts 16:18 ); but this power was never spoken of as exorcism.  </p>
Expiation	<p>Guilt is said to be expiated when it is visited with punishment falling on a substitute. Expiation is made for our sins when they are punished not in ourselves but in another who consents to stand in our room. It is that by which reconciliation is effected. Sin is thus said to be "covered" by vicarious satisfaction. </p><p> The cover or lid of the ark is termed in the LXX. hilasterion, that which covered or shut out the claims and demands of the law against the sins of God's people, whereby he became "propitious" to them. </p><p> The idea of vicarious expiation runs through the whole Old Testament system of sacrifices. (See PROPITIATION .) </p>
Eye	<p>(Heb. 'ain, meaning "flowing"), applied (1) to a fountain, frequently; (2) to colour ( Numbers 11:7 ; RSV, "appearance," marg. "eye"); (3) the face ( Exodus 10:5 Exodus 10:15 ;  Numbers 22:5 Numbers 22:11 ), in  Numbers 14:14 , "face to face" (RSV marg., "eye to eye"). "Between the eyes", i.e., the forehead ( Exodus 13:9 Exodus 13:16 ).  </p><p> The expression ( Proverbs 23:31 ), "when it giveth his colour in the cup," is literally, "when it giveth out [or showeth] its eye." The beads or bubbles of wine are thus spoken of. "To set the eyes" on any one is to view him with favour ( Genesis 44:21 ;  Job 24:23 ;  Jeremiah 39:12 ). This word is used figuratively in the expressions an "evil eye" ( Matthew 20:15 ), a "bountiful eye" ( Proverbs 22:9 ), "haughty eyes" ( (6:17  marg.), "wanton eyes" ( Isaiah 3:16 ), "eyes full of adultery" ( 2 Peter 2:14 ), "the lust of the eyes" ( 1 John 2:16 ). Christians are warned against "eye-service" ( Ephesians 6:6 ;  Colossians 3:22 ). Men were sometimes punished by having their eyes put out ( 1 Samuel 11:2 ; Samson,  Judges 16:21 ; Zedekiah,  2 Kings 25:7 ).  </p><p> The custom of painting the eyes is alluded to in  2 Kings 9:30 , RSV;  Jeremiah 4:30 ;  Ezekiel 23:40 , a custom which still prevails extensively among Eastern women.  </p>
Ezekias	<p>Grecized form of Hezekiah ( Matthew 1:9 Matthew 1:10 ).  </p>
Ezekiel	<p>God will strengthen. </p><li> 1 Chronicles 24:16 , "Jehezekel."  </li><li> One of the great prophets, the son of Buzi the priest ( Ezekiel 1:3 ). He was one of the Jewish exiles who settled at Tel-Abib, on the banks of the Chebar, "in the land of the Chaldeans." He was probably carried away captive with Jehoiachin ( 1:2 ;  2 Kings  24:14-16 ) about B.C. 597. His prophetic call came to him "in the fifth year of Jehoiachin's captivity" (B.C. 594). He had a house in the place of his exile, where he lost his wife, in the ninth year of his exile, by some sudden and unforeseen stroke ( Ezekiel 8:1 ;  24:18 ). He held a prominent place among the exiles, and was frequently consulted by the elders ( 8:1 ;  11:25 ;  14:1 ;  20:1 ). His ministry extended over twenty-three years ( 29:17 ), B.C. 595-573, during part of which he was contemporary with ( Daniel 14:14 ;  28:3 ) and Jeremiah, and probably also with Obadiah. The time and manner of his death are unknown. His reputed tomb is pointed out in the neighbourhood of Bagdad, at a place called Keffil.   </li>
Ezekiel, Book of	<p>consists mainly of three groups of prophecies. After an account of his call to the prophetical office ( (1-3:21), ), Ezekiel (1) utters words of denunciation against the Jews ( 3:22-24 ), warning them of the certain destruction of Jerusalem, in opposition to the words of the false prophets ( 4:1-3 ). The symbolical acts, by which the extremities to which Jerusalem would be reduced are described in ch. 4,5, show his intimate acquaintance with the Levitical legislation. (See   Exodus 22:30 ;  Deuteronomy 14:21 ;  Leviticus 5:2 ;  Leviticus 7:18 Leviticus 7:24 ;  17:15 ;  19:7 ;  22:8 , etc.)  </p><li> Prophecies against various surrounding nations: against the Ammonites ( Ezekiel 25:1-7 ), the Moabites (8-11), the Edomites (12-14), the Philistines (15-17), Tyre and Sidon (26-28), and against Egypt (29-32).  </li><li> Prophecies delivered after the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar: the triumphs of Israel and of the kingdom of God on earth (Ezek. 33-39); Messianic times, and the establishment and prosperity of the kingdom of God (40;48).  <p> The closing visions of this book are referred to in the book of Revelation (Ezek. 38=Rev  20:8 ; Eze  Ezekiel 22:1 Ezekiel 22:2 ). Other references to this book are also found in the New Testament. (Compare  Romans 2:24  with  Ezekiel 36:2 ;  Romans 10:5 ,  Galatians 3:12  with  Ezekiel 20:11 ;  2 Pet  3:4  with  Ezekiel 12:22 .)  </p><p> It may be noted that Daniel, fourteen years after his deportation from Jerusalem, is mentioned by ( Ezekiel 14:14 ) along with Noah and Job as distinguished for his righteousness, and some five years later he is spoken of as pre-eminent for his wisdom ( 28:3 ).  </p><p> Ezekiel's prophecies are characterized by symbolical and allegorical representations, "unfolding a rich series of majestic visions and of colossal symbols." There are a great many also of "symbolcal actions embodying vivid conceptions on the part of the prophet" ( 4:1-4 ;  5:1-4 ;  12:3-6 ;  24:3-5 ;  37:16 , etc.) "The mode of representation, in which symbols and allegories occupy a prominent place, gives a dark, mysterious character to the prophecies of Ezekiel. They are obscure and enigmatical. A cloudy mystery overhangs them which it is almost impossible to penetrate. Jerome calls the book 'a labyrith of the mysteries of God.' It was because of this obscurity that the Jews forbade any one to read it till he had attained the age of thirty."  </p><p> Ezekiel is singular in the frequency with which he refers to the Pentateuch (e.g., Ezek. 27;  28:13 ;  31:8 ;  Ezekiel 36:11 Ezekiel 36:34 ;  47:13 , etc.). He shows also an acquaintance with the writings of Hosea ( Ezekiel 37:22 ), Isaiah ( Ezekiel 8:12 ;  29:6 ), and especially with those of Jeremiah, his older contemporary ( Jeremiah 24:7 Jeremiah 24:9 ;  48:37 ).  </p> </li>
Ezel	<p>a separation, ( 1 Samuel 20:19 ), a stone, or heap of stones, in the neighbourhood of Saul's residence, the scene of the parting of David and Jonathan (42). The margin of the Authorized Version reads, "The stone that sheweth the way," in this rendering following the Targum.  </p>
Ezer	<p>treasure. </p><li> One of the sons of Seir, the native princes, "dukes," of Mount Hor ( Genesis 36:21 Genesis 36:27 ). </li><li> 1 Chronicles 7:21 ; </li><li> 4:4 . </li><li> One of the Gadite champions who repaired to David at Ziklag ( 12:9 ). </li><li> A Levite ( Nehemiah 3:19 ). </li><li> A priest ( 12:42 ).   </li>
Ezion-geber	<p>the giant's backbone (so called from the head of a mountain which runs out into the sea), an ancient city and harbour at the north-east end of the Elanitic branch of the Red Sea, the Gulf of Akabah, near Elath or Eloth ( Numbers 33:35 ;  Deuteronomy 2:8 ). Here Solomon built ships, "Tarshish ships," like those trading from Tyre to Tarshish and the west, which traded with Ophir ( 1 Kings 9:26 ;  2 Chr  8:17 ); and here also Jehoshaphat's fleet was shipwrecked ( 1 Kings 22:48 ;  2 Chr  20:36 ). It became a populous town, many of the Jews settling in it ( 2 Kings 16:6 , "Elath"). It is supposed that anciently the north end of the gulf flowed further into the country than now, as far as 'Ain el-Ghudyan, which is 10 miles up the dry bed of the Arabah, and that Ezion-geber may have been there.  </p>
Ezra	<p>help. </p><li> A priest among those that returned to Jerusalem under Zerubabel ( Nehemiah 12:1 ).  </li><li> The "scribe" who led the second body of exiles that returned from Babylon to Jerusalem B.C. 459, and author of the book of Scripture which bears his name. He was the son, or perhaps grandson, of Seraiah ( 2 Kings 25:18-21 ), and a lineal descendant of Phinehas, the son of Aaron ( Ezra 7:1-5 ). All we know of his personal history is contained in the last four chapters of his book, and in  Nehemiah 8  and  12:26 .  <p> In the seventh year of the reign of Artaxerxes Longimanus (see DARIUS), he obtained leave to go up to Jerusalem and to take with him a company of Israelites ( Ezra 8 ). Artaxerxes manifested great interest in Ezra's undertaking, granting him "all his request," and loading him with gifts for the house of God. Ezra assembled the band of exiles, probably about 5,000 in all, who were prepared to go up with him to Jerusalem, on the banks of the Ahava, where they rested for three days, and were put into order for their march across the desert, which was completed in four months. His proceedings at Jerusalem on his arrival there are recorded in his book.  </p><p> He was "a ready scribe in the law of Moses," who "had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments." "He is," says Professor Binnie, "the first well-defined example of an order of men who have never since ceased in the church; men of sacred erudition, who devote their lives to the study of the Holy Scriptures, in order that they may be in a condition to interpret them for the instruction and edification of the church. It is significant that the earliest mention of the pulpit occurs in the history of Ezra's ministry ( Nehemiah 8:4 ). He was much more of a teacher than a priest. We learn from the account of his labours in the book of Nehemiah that he was careful to have the whole people instructed in the law of Moses; and there is no reason to reject the constant tradition of the Jews which connects his name with the collecting and editing of the Old Testament canon. The final completion of the canon may have been, and probably was, the work of a later generation; but Ezra seems to have put it much into the shape in which it is still found in the Hebrew Bible. When it is added that the complete organization of the synagogue dates from this period, it will be seen that the age was emphatically one of Biblical study" (The Psalms: their History, etc.).  </p><p> For about fourteen years, i.e., till B.C. 445, we have no record of what went on in Jerusalem after Ezra had set in order the ecclesiastical and civil affairs of the nation. In that year another distinguished personage, Nehemiah, appears on the scene. After the ruined wall of the city had been built by Nehemiah, there was a great gathering of the people at Jerusalem preparatory to the dedication of the wall. On the appointed day the whole population assembled, and the law was read aloud to them by Ezra and his assistants ( Nehemiah 8:3 ). The remarkable scene is described in detail. There was a great religious awakening. For successive days they held solemn assemblies, confessing their sins and offering up solemn sacrifices. They kept also the feast of Tabernacles with great solemnity and joyous enthusiasm, and then renewed their national covenant to be the Lord's. Abuses were rectified, and arrangements for the temple service completed, and now nothing remained but the dedication of the walls of the city ( Nehemiah 12 ).  </p> </li>
Ezra, Book of	<p>This book is the record of events occurring at the close of the Babylonian exile. It was at one time included in Nehemiah, the Jews regarding them as one volume. The two are still distinguished in the Vulgate version as I. and II. Esdras. It consists of two principal divisions: </p><li> The history of the first return of exiles, in the first year of Cyrus (B.C. 536), till the completion and dedication of the new temple, in the sixth year of Darius Hystapes (B.C. 515), ch. 1-6. From the close of the sixth to the opening of the seventh chapter there is a blank in the history of about sixty years.  </li><li> The history of the second return under Ezra, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes Longimanus, and of the events that took place at Jerusalem after Ezra's arrival there (7-10).  <p> The book thus contains memorabilia connected with the Jews, from the decree of Cyrus (B.C. 536) to the reformation by Ezra (B.C. 456), extending over a period of about eighty years.  </p><p> There is no quotation from this book in the New Testament, but there never has been any doubt about its being canonical. Ezra was probably the author of this book, at least of the greater part of it (comp  Nehemiah 7:27 Nehemiah 7:28 ;  8:1 , etc.), as he was also of the Books of Chronicles, the close of which forms the opening passage of Ezra.  </p> </li>
Ezrahite	<p>a title given to Ethan ( 1 Kings 4:31 ;  Psalms 89 , title) and Heman ( Psalms 88 , title). They were both sons of Zerah ( 1 Chronicles 2:6 ).  </p>
Ezri	<p>help of Jehovah, the son of Chelub. He superintended, under David, those who "did the work of the field for tillage" ( 1 Chronicles 27:26 ).  </p>
Flagon	<p>Heb. ashishah, ( 2 Samuel 6:19 ;  1 Chronicles 16:3 ; Cant  2:5 ;  Hosea 3:1 ), meaning properly "a cake of pressed raisins." "Flagons of wine" of the Authorized Version should be, as in the Revised Version, "cakes of raisins" in all these passages. In  Isaiah 22:24  it is the rendering of the Hebrew <i> nebel</i> , which properly means a bottle or vessel of skin. (Compare  1 Samuel 1:24 ;  10:3 ;  25:18 ;  2 Sam  16:1 , where the same Hebrew word is used.)  </p>
Flame of fire	<p>is the chosen symbol of the holiness of God ( Exodus 3:2 ;  Revelation 2:18 ), as indicating "the intense, all-consuming operation of his holiness in relation to sin."  </p>
Flax	<p>(Heb. pishtah, i.e., "peeled", in allusion to the fact that the stalks of flax when dried were first split or peeled before being steeped in water for the purpose of destroying the pulp). This plant was cultivated from earliest times. The flax of Egypt was destroyed by the plague of hail when it "was bolled", i.e., was forming pods for seed ( Exodus 9:31 ). It was extensively cultivated both in Egypt and Palestine. Reference is made in  Joshua 2:6  to the custom of drying flax-stalks by exposing them to the sun on the flat roofs of houses. It was much used in forming articles of clothing such as girdles, also cords and bands ( Leviticus 13:48 Leviticus 13:52 Leviticus 13:59 ;  Deuteronomy 22:11 ). (See LINEN .) </p>
Flea	<p>David at the cave of Adullam thus addressed his persecutor Saul ( 1 Samuel 24:14 ): "After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea?" He thus speaks of himself as the poor, contemptible object of the monarch's pursuit, a "worthy object truly for an expedition of the king of Israel with his picked troops!" This insect is in Eastern language the popular emblem of insignificance. In  1 Samuel 26:20  the LXX. read "come out to seek my life" instead of "to seek a flea."  </p>
Fleece	<p>the wool of a sheep, whether shorn off or still attached to the skin ( Deuteronomy 18:4 ;  Job 31:20 ). The miracle of Gideon's fleece ( Judges 6:37-40 ) consisted in the dew having fallen at one time on the fleece without any on the floor, and at another time in the fleece remaining dry while the ground was wet with dew.  </p>
Flesh	<p>in the Old Testament denotes (1) a particular part of the body of man and animals ( Genesis 2:21 ;  41:2 ;  Psalms 102:5 , marg.); (2) the whole body ( Psalms 16:9 ); (3) all living things having flesh, and particularly humanity as a whole ( Genesis 6:12 Genesis 6:13 ); (4) mutability and weakness ( 2 Chronicles 32:8 ; Compare  Isaiah 31:3 ;  Psalms 78:39 ). As suggesting the idea of softness it is used in the expression "heart of flesh" ( Ezekiel 11:19 ). The expression "my flesh and bone" ( Judges 9:2 ;  Isaiah 58:7 ) denotes relationship.  </p><p> In the New Testament, besides these it is also used to denote the sinful element of human nature as opposed to the "Spirit" ( Romans 6:19 ;  Matthew 16:17 ). Being "in the flesh" means being unrenewed ( Romans 7:5 ;  Romans 8:8 Romans 8:9 ), and to live "according to the flesh" is to live and act sinfully ( Romans 8:4 Romans 8:5 Romans 8:7 Romans 8:12 ).  </p><p> This word also denotes the human nature of Christ ( John 1:14 , "The Word was made flesh." Compare also  1 Timothy 3:16 ;  Romans 1:3 ).  </p>
Flesh-hook	<p>a many-pronged fork used in the sacrificial services ( 1 Samuel 2:13 1 Samuel 2:14 ;  Exodus 27:3 ;  38:3 ) by the priest in drawing away the flesh. The fat of the sacrifice, together with the breast and shoulder ( Leviticus 7:29-34 ), were presented by the worshipper to the priest. The fat was burned on the alter ( 3:3-5 ), and the breast and shoulder became the portion of the priests. But Hophni and Phinehas, not content with this, sent a servant to seize with a flesh-hook a further portion.  </p>
Flint	<p>abounds in all the plains and valleys of the wilderness of the forty years' wanderings. In  Isaiah 50:7  and  Ezekiel 3:9  the expressions, where the word is used, means that the "Messiah would be firm and resolute amidst all contempt and scorn which he would meet; that he had made up his mind to endure it, and would not shrink from any kind or degree of suffering which would be necessary to accomplish the great work in which he was engaged." (Compare  Ezekiel 3:8 Ezekiel 3:9 .) The words "like a flint" are used with reference to the hoofs of horses ( Isaiah 5:28 ).  </p>
Flood	<p>an event recorded in  Genesis 7  and 8. (See DELUGE .) In  Joshua 24:2 Joshua 24:3 Joshua 24:14 Joshua 24:15 , the word "flood" (RSV, "river") means the river Euphrates. In  Psalms 66:6 , this word refers to the river Jordan.  </p>
Flour	<p>Grain reduced to the form of meal is spoken of in the time of Abraham ( Genesis 18:6 ). As baking was a daily necessity, grain was also ground daily at the mills ( Jeremiah 25:10 ). The flour mingled with water was kneaded in kneading-troughs, and sometimes leaven ( Exodus 12:34 ) was added and sometimes omitted ( Genesis 19:3 ). The dough was then formed into thin cakes nine or ten inches in diameter and baked in the oven.  </p><p> Fine flour was offered by the poor as a sin-offering ( Leviticus 5:11-13 ), and also in connection with other sacrifices ( Numbers 15:3-12 ;  28:7-29 ).  </p>
Flowers	<p>Very few species of flowers are mentioned in the Bible although they abounded in Palestine. It has been calculated that in Western Syria and Palestine from two thousand to two thousand five hundred plants are found, of which about five hundred probably are British wild-flowers. Their beauty is often alluded to (Cant  2:12 ;  Matthew 6:28 ). They are referred to as affording an emblem of the transitory nature of human life ( Job 14:2 ;  Psalms 103:15 ;  Isaiah 28:1 ;  40:6 ;  James 1:10 ). Gardens containing flowers and fragrant herbs are spoken of (Cant  4:16 ;  <span class="badLink">6:2</span> ).  </p>
Flute	<p>a musical instrument, probably composed of a number of pipes, mentioned  Daniel 3:5 Daniel 3:7 Daniel 3:10 Daniel 3:15 .  </p><p> In  Matthew 9:23 Matthew 9:24 , notice is taken of players on the flute, here called "minstrels" (but in RSV "flute-players").  </p><p> Flutes were in common use among the ancient Egyptians. </p>
Fly	<p>Heb. zebub, (Eccl  10:1 ;  Isaiah 7:18 ). This fly was so grievous a pest that the Phoenicians invoked against it the aid of their god Baal-zebub (q.v.). The prophet ( Isaiah 7:18 ) alludes to some poisonous fly which was believed to be found on the confines of Egypt, and which would be called by the Lord. Poisonous flies exist in many parts of Africa, for instance, the different kinds of tsetse.  </p><p> Heb. 'arob, the name given to the insects sent as a plague on the land of Egypt ( Exodus 8:21-31 ;  Psalms 78:45 ;  105:31 ). The LXX. render this by a word which means the "dog-fly," the cynomuia. The Jewish commentators regarded the Hebrew word here as connected with the word <i> 'arab</i> , which means "mingled;" and they accordingly supposed the plague to consist of a mixed multitude of animals, beasts, reptiles, and insects. But there is no doubt that "the <i> 'arab</i> " denotes a single definite species. Some interpreters regard it as the Blatta orientalis, the cockroach, a species of beetle. These insects "inflict very painful bites with their jaws; gnaw and destroy clothes, household furniture, leather, and articles of every kind, and either consume or render unavailable all eatables." </p>
Foam	<p>( Hosea 10:7 ), the rendering of <i> ketseph</i> , which properly means twigs or splinters (as rendered in the LXX. and marg. RSV). The expression in Hosea may therefore be read, "as a chip on the face of the water," denoting the helplessness of the piece of wood as compared with the irresistable current. </p>
Fodder	<p>Heb. belil, ( Job 6:5 ), meaning properly a mixture or medley (Lat. farrago), "made up of various kinds of grain, as wheat, barley, vetches, and the like, all mixed together, and then sown or given to cattle" ( Job 24:6 , A.V. "corn," RSV "provender;"  Isaiah 30:24 , provender").  </p>
Fold	<p>an enclosure for flocks to rest together ( Isaiah 13:20 ). Sheep-folds are mentioned  Numbers 32:16 Numbers 32:24 Numbers 32:36 ;  2 Sam  7:8 ;  Zephaniah 2:6 ;  John 10:1 , etc. It was prophesied of the cities of Ammon ( Ezekiel 25:5 ), Aroer ( Isaiah 17:2 ), and Judaea, that they would be folds or couching-places for flocks. "Among the pots," of the Authorized Version ( Psalms 68:13 ), is rightly in the Revised Version, "among the sheepfolds."  </p>
Food	<p>Originally the Creator granted the use of the vegetable world for food to man ( Genesis 1:29 ), with the exception mentioned ( 2:17 ). The use of animal food was probably not unknown to the antediluvians. There is, however, a distinct law on the subject given to Noah after the Deluge ( Genesis 9:2-5 ). Various articles of food used in the patriarchal age are mentioned in  Genesis 18:6-8 ;  25:34 ;  Genesis 27:3 Genesis 27:4 ;  43:11 . Regarding the food of the Israelites in Egypt, see  Exodus 16:3 ;  Numbers 11:5 . In the wilderness their ordinary food was miraculously supplied in the manna. They had also quails ( Exodus 16:11-13 ;  Numbers 11:31 ).  </p><p> In the law of Moses there are special regulations as to the animals to be used for food ( Leviticus 11 ;  Deuteronomy 14:3-21 ). The Jews were also forbidden to use as food anything that had been consecrated to idols ( Exodus 34:15 ), or animals that had died of disease or had been torn by wild beasts ( Exodus 22:31 ;  Leviticus 22:8 ). (See also for other restrictions  Exodus 23:19 ;  29:13-22 ;  Leviticus 3:4-9 ;  Leviticus 9:18 Leviticus 9:19 ;  22:8 ;  Deuteronomy 14:21 .) But beyond these restrictions they had a large grant from God ( Deuteronomy 14:26 ;  Deuteronomy 32:13 Deuteronomy 32:14 ).  </p><p> Food was prepared for use in various ways. The cereals were sometimes eaten without any preparation ( Leviticus 23:14 ;  Deuteronomy 23:25 ;  2 Kings  4:42 ). Vegetables were cooked by boiling ( Genesis 25:30 Genesis 25:34 ;  2 Kings  Genesis 4:38  Genesis 4:39 ), and thus also other articles of food were prepared for use ( Genesis 27:4 ;  Proverbs 23:3 ;  Ezekiel 24:10 ;  Luke 24:42 ;  John 21:9 ). Food was also prepared by roasting ( Exodus 12:8 ;  Leviticus 2:14 ). (See COOK .) </p>
Footstool	<p>connected with a throne ( 2 Chronicles 9:18 ). Jehovah symbolically dwelt in the holy place between the cherubim above the ark of the covenant. The ark was his footstool ( 1 Chronicles 28:2 ;  Psalms 99:5 ;  132:7 ). And as heaven is God's throne, so the earth is his footstool ( Psalms 110:1 ;  Isaiah 66:1 ;  Matthew 5:35 ).  </p>
Forces	<p>of the Gentiles ( Isaiah 60:5 Isaiah 60:11 ; RSV, "the wealth of the nations") denotes the wealth of the heathen. The whole passage means that the wealth of the Gentile world should be consecrated to the service of the church.  </p>
Ford	<p>Mention is frequently made of the fords of the Jordan ( Joshua 2:7 ;  Judges 3:28 ;  Judges 12:5 Judges 12:6 ), which must have been very numerous; about fifty perhaps. The most notable was that of Bethabara. Mention is also made of the ford of the Jabbok ( Genesis 32:22 ), and of the fords of Arnon ( Isaiah 16:2 ) and of the Euphrates ( Jeremiah 51:32 ).  </p>
Forehead	<p>The practice common among Oriental nations of colouring the forehead or impressing on it some distinctive mark as a sign of devotion to some deity is alluded to in  Revelation 13:16 Revelation 13:17 ;  14:9 ;  17:5 ;  20:4 .  </p><p> The "jewel on thy forehead" mentioned in  Ezekiel 16:12  (RSV, "a ring upon thy nose") was in all probability the "nose-ring" ( Isaiah 3:21 ).  </p><p> In  Ezekiel 3:7  the word "impudent" is rightly rendered in the Revised Version "an hard forehead." (See also ver. 8,9.)  </p>
Foreigner	<p>a Gentile. Such as resided among the Hebrews were required by the law to be treated with kindness ( Exodus 22:21 ;  23:9 ;  Leviticus 19:33 Leviticus 19:34 ;  23:22 ;  Deuteronomy 14:28 ;  Deuteronomy 16:10 Deuteronomy 16:11 ;  24:19 ). They enjoyed in many things equal rights with the native-born residents ( Exodus 12:49 ;  Leviticus 24:22 ;  Numbers 15:15 ;  35:15 ), but were not allowed to do anything which was an abomination according to the Jewish law ( Exodus 20:10 ;  Leviticus 17:15 Leviticus 17:16 ;  18:26 ;  20:2 ;  24:16 , etc.).  </p>
Foreknowledge of God	<p> Acts 2:23 ;  Romans 8:29 ;  11:2 ;  1 Peter 1:2 ), one of those high attributes essentially appertaining to him the full import of which we cannot comprehend. In the most absolute sense his knowledge is infinite ( 1 Samuel 23:9-13 ;  Jeremiah 38:17-23 ;  42:9-22 ,  Matthew 11:21 Matthew 11:23 ;  Acts 15:18 ).  </p>
Forerunner	<p>John the Baptist went before our Lord in this character ( Mark 1:2 Mark 1:3 ). Christ so called ( Hebrews 6:20 ) as entering before his people into the holy place as their head and guide.  </p>
Forest	<p>Heb. ya'ar, meaning a dense wood, from its luxuriance. Thus all the great primeval forests of Syria (Eccl  2:6 ;  Isaiah 44:14 ;  Jeremiah 5:6 ;  Micah 5:8 ). The most extensive was the trans-Jordanic forest of Ephraim ( 2 Samuel 18:6 2 Samuel 18:8 ;  Joshua 17:15 Joshua 17:18 ), which is probably the same as the wood of Ephratah ( Psalms 132:6 ), some part of the great forest of Gilead. It was in this forest that Absalom was slain by Joab. David withdrew to the forest of Hareth in the mountains of Judah to avoid the fury of Saul ( 1 Samuel 22:5 ). We read also of the forest of Bethel ( 2 Kings 2:23 2 Kings 2:24 ), and of that which the Israelites passed in their pursuit of the Philistines ( 1 Samuel 14:25 ), and of the forest of the cedars of Lebanon ( 1 Kings 4:33 ;  2 Kings  19:23 ;  Hosea 14:5 Hosea 14:6 ).  </p><p> "The house of the forest of Lebanon ( 1 Kings 7:2 ;  10:17 ;  2 Chr  9:16 ) was probably Solomon's armoury, and was so called because the wood of its many pillars came from Lebanon, and they had the appearance of a forest. (See BAALBEC .) </p><p> Heb. horesh, denoting a thicket of trees, underwood, jungle, bushes, or trees entangled, and therefore affording a safe hiding-place. place. This word is rendered "forest" only in  2 Chronicles 27:4 . It is also rendered "wood", the "wood" in the "wilderness of Ziph," in which david concealed himself ( 1 Samuel 23:15 ), which lay south-east of Hebron. In  Isaiah 17:19  this word is in Authorized Version rendered incorrectly "bough."  </p><p> Heb. pardes, meaning an enclosed garden or plantation. Asaph is ( Nehemiah 2:8 ) called the "keeper of the king's forest." The same Hebrew word is used Eccl  2:5 , where it is rendered in the plural "orchards" (RSV, "parks"), and Cant  4: :  13 , rendered "orchard" (RSV marg., "a paradise").  </p><p> "The forest of the vintage" ( Zechariah 11:2 , "inaccessible forest," or RSV "strong forest") is probably a figurative allusion to Jerusalem, or the verse may simply point to the devastation of the region referred to.  </p><p> The forest is an image of unfruitfulness as contrasted with a cultivated field ( Isaiah 29:17 ;  32:15 ;  Jeremiah 26:18 ;  Hosea 2:12 ). ( Isaiah 10:19 Isaiah 10:33 Isaiah 10:34 ) likens the Assyrian host under Sennacherib (q.v.) to the trees of some huge forest, to be suddenly cut down by an unseen stroke.  </p>
Forgiveness of sin	<p>one of the constituent parts of justification. In pardoning sin, God absolves the sinner from the condemnation of the law, and that on account of the work of Christ, i.e., he removes the guilt of sin, or the sinner's actual liability to eternal wrath on account of it. All sins are forgiven freely ( Acts 5:31 ;  13:38 ;  1 John 1:6-9 ). The sinner is by this act of grace for ever freed from the guilt and penalty of his sins. This is the peculiar prerogative of God ( Psalms 130:4 ;  Mark 2:5 ). It is offered to all in the gospel. (See JUSTIFICATION .) </p>
Fornication	<p>in every form of it was sternly condemned by the Mosaic law ( Leviticus 21:9 ;  19:29 ;  Deuteronomy 22:20 Deuteronomy 22:21 Deuteronomy 22:23-29 ;  23:18 ;  Exodus 22:16 ). (See ADULTERY .) </p><p> But this word is more frequently used in a symbolical than in its ordinary sense. It frequently means a forsaking of God or a following after idols ( Isaiah 1:2 ;  Jeremiah 2:20 ; Ezek. 16;  Hosea 1:2 ;  2:1-5 ;  Jeremiah 3:8 Jeremiah 3:9 ).  </p>
Fortunatus	<p>fortunate, a disciple of Corinth who visited Paul at Ephesus, and returned with Stephanas and Achaicus, the bearers of the apostle's first letter to the Corinthians ( 1 Corinthians 16:17 ).  </p>
Fountain	<p>(Heb. 'ain; i.e., "eye" of the water desert), a natural source of living water. Palestine was a "land of brooks of water, of fountains, and depths that spring out of valleys and hills" ( Deuteronomy 8:7 ;  11:11 ).  </p><p> These fountains, bright sparkling "eyes" of the desert, are remarkable for their abundance and their beauty, especially on the west of Jordan. All the perennial rivers and streams of the country are supplied from fountains, and depend comparatively little on surface water. "Palestine is a country of mountains and hills, and it abounds in fountains of water. The murmur of these waters is heard in every dell, and the luxuriant foliage which surrounds them is seen in every plain." Besides its rain-water, its cisterns and fountains, Jerusalem had also an abundant supply of water in the magnificent reservoir called "Solomon's Pools" (q.v.), at the head of the Urtas valley, whence it was conveyed to the city by subterrean channels some 10 miles in length. These have all been long ago destroyed, so that no water from the "Pools" now reaches Jerusalem. Only one fountain has been discovered at Jerusalem, the so-called "Virgins's Fountains," in the valley of Kidron; and only one well (Heb. beer), the Bir Eyub, also in the valley of Kidron, south of the King's Gardens, which has been dug through the solid rock. The inhabitants of Jerusalem are now mainly dependent on the winter rains, which they store in cisterns. (See WELL .) </p>
Fountain of the Virgin	<p>the perennial source from which the Pool of Siloam (q.v.) is supplied, the waters flowing in a copious stream to it through a tunnel cut through the rock, the actual length of which is 1,750 feet. The spring rises in a cave 20 feet by 7. A serpentine tunnel 67 feet long runs from it toward the left, off which the tunnel to the Pool of Siloam branches. It is the only unfailing fountain in Jerusalem.  </p><p> The fountain received its name from the "fantastic legend" that here the virgin washed the swaddling-clothes of our Lord. </p><p> This spring has the singular characteristic of being intermittent, flowing from three to five times daily in winter, twice daily in summer, and only once daily in autumn. This peculiarity is accounted for by the supposition that the outlet from the reservoir is by a passage in the form of a siphon. </p>
Fowler	<p>the arts of, referred to  Psalms 91:3 ;  124:7 ;  Proverbs 6:5 ;  Jeremiah 5:26 ;  Hosea 9:8 ;  Ezekiel 17:20 ; Eccl  <span class="badLink">9:12</span> . Birds of all kinds abound in Palestine, and the capture of these for the table and for other uses formed the employment of many persons. The traps and snares used for this purpose are mentioned  Hosea 5:1 ;  Proverbs 7:23 ;  22:5 ;  Amos 3:5 ;  Psalms 69:22 ; Compare  Deuteronomy 22:6 Deuteronomy 22:7 .  </p>
Fox	<p>(Heb. shu'al, a name derived from its digging or burrowing under ground), the Vulpes thaleb, or Syrian fox, the only species of this animal indigenous to Palestine. It burrows, is silent and solitary in its habits, is destructive to vineyards, being a plunderer of ripe grapes (Cant  2:15 ). The Vulpes Niloticus, or Egyptian dog-fox, and the Vulpes vulgaris, or common fox, are also found in Palestine.  </p><p> The proverbial cunning of the fox is alluded to in  Ezekiel 13:4 , and in  Luke 13:32 , where our Lord calls Herod "that fox." In  Judges 15:4 Judges 15:5 , the reference is in all probability to the jackal. The Hebrew word <i> shu'al_ through the Persian _schagal</i> becomes our jackal (Canis aureus), so that the word may bear that signification here. The reasons for preferring the rendering "jackal" are (1) that it is more easily caught than the fox; (2) that the fox is shy and suspicious, and flies mankind, while the jackal does not; and (3) that foxes are difficult, jackals comparatively easy, to treat in the way here described. Jackals hunt in large numbers, and are still very numerous in Southern Palestine.  </p>
Frankincense	<p>(Heb. lebonah; Gr. libanos, i.e., "white"), an odorous resin imported from Arabia ( Isaiah 60:6 ;  Jeremiah 6:20 ), yet also growing in Palestine (Cant  4:14 ). It was one of the ingredients in the perfume of the sanctuary ( Exodus 30:34 ), and was used as an accompaniment of the meat-offering ( Leviticus 2:1 Leviticus 2:16 ;  6:15 ;  24:7 ). When burnt it emitted a fragrant odour, and hence the incense became a symbol of the Divine name ( Malachi 1:11 ; Cant  1:3 ) and an emblem of prayer ( Psalms 141:2 ;  Luke 1:10 ;  Revelation 5:8 ;  8:3 ).  </p><p> This frankincense, or olibanum, used by the Jews in the temple services is not to be confounded with the frankincense of modern commerce, which is an exudation of the Norway spruce fir, the Pinus abies. It was probably a resin from the Indian tree known to botanists by the name of Boswellia serrata or thurifera, which grows to the height of forty feet. </p>
Freedom	<p>The law of Moses pointed out the cases in which the servants of the Hebrews were to receive their freedom ( Exodus 21:2-4 Exodus 21:7 Exodus 21:8 ;  Leviticus 25:39-42 Leviticus 25:47-55 ;  Deuteronomy 15:12-18 ). Under the Roman law the "freeman" (ingenuus) was one born free; the "freedman" (libertinus) was a manumitted slave, and had not equal rights with the freeman ( Acts 22:28 ; Compare  Acts 16:37-39 ;  21:39 ;  22:25 ;  Acts 25:11 Acts 25:12 ).  </p>
Free-will offering	<p>a spontaneous gift ( Exodus 35:29 ), a voluntary sacrifice ( Leviticus 22:23 ;  Ezra 3:5 ), as opposed to one in consequence of a vow, or in expiation of some offence.  </p>
Frog	<p>(Heb. tsepharde'a, meaning a "marsh-leaper"). This reptile is mentioned in the Old Testament only in connection with one of the plagues which fell on the land of Egypt ( Exodus 8:2-14 ;  Psalms 78:45 ;  105:30 ).  </p><p> In the New Testament this word occurs only in  Revelation 16:13 , where it is referred to as a symbol of uncleanness. The only species of frog existing in Palestine is the green frog (Rana esculenta), the well-known edible frog of the Continent.  </p>
Frontlets	<p>occurs only in  Exodus 13:16 ;  Deuteronomy 6:8 , and  11:18 . The meaning of the injunction to the Israelites, with regard to the statues and precepts given them, that they should "bind them for a sign upon their hand, and have them as frontlets between their eyes," was that they should keep them distinctly in view and carefully attend to them. But soon after their return from Babylon they began to interpret this injunction literally, and had accordingly portions of the law written out and worn about their person. These they called tephillin, i.e., "prayers." The passages so written out on strips of parchment were these,  Exodus 12:2-10 ;  13:11-21 ;  Deuteronomy 6:4-9 ;  11:18-21 . They were then "rolled up in a case of black calfskin, which was attached to a stiffer piece of leather, having a thong one finger broad and one cubit and a half long. Those worn on the forehead were written on four strips of parchment, and put into four little cells within a square case, which had on it the Hebrew letter called shin, the three points of which were regarded as an emblem of God." This case tied around the forehead in a particular way was called "the tephillah on the head." (See PHYLACTERY .) </p>
Frost	<p>(Heb. kerah, from its smoothness)  Job 37:10  (RSV, "ice");  Genesis 31:40 ;  Jeremiah 36:30 ; rendered "ice" in  Job 6:16 Job 38:29 ; and "crystal" in  Ezekiel 1:22 . "At the present day frost is entirely unknown in the lower portions of the valley of the Jordan, but slight frosts are sometimes felt on the sea-coast and near Lebanon." Throughout Western Asia cold frosty nights are frequently succeeded by warm days.  </p><p> "Hoar frost" (Heb. kephor, so called from its covering the ground) is mentioned in  Exodus 16:14 ;  Job 38:29 ;  Psalms 147:16 .  </p><p> In  Psalms 78:47  the word rendered "frost" (RSV marg., "great hail-stones"), <i> hanamal</i> , occurs only there. It is rendered by Gesenius, the Hebrew lexicographer, "ant," and so also by others, but the usual interpretation derived from the ancient versions may be maintained. </p>
Fruit	<p>a word as used in Scripture denoting produce in general, whether vegetable or animal. The Hebrews divided the fruits of the land into three classes:, </p><li> The fruit of the field, "corn-fruit" (Heb. dagan); all kinds of grain and pulse.  </li><li> The fruit of the vine, "vintage-fruit" (Heb. tirosh); grapes, whether moist or dried.  </li><li> "Orchard-fruits" (Heb. yitshar), as dates, figs, citrons, etc.  <p> Injunctions concerning offerings and tithes were expressed by these Hebrew terms alone ( Numbers 18:12 ;  Deuteronomy 14:23 ). This word "fruit" is also used of children or offspring ( Genesis 30:2 ;  Deuteronomy 7:13 ;  Luke 1:42 ;  Psalms 21:10 ;  132:11 ); also of the progeny of beasts ( Deuteronomy 28:51 ;  Isaiah 14:29 ).  </p><p> It is used metaphorically in a variety of forms ( Psalms 104:13 ;  Proverbs 1:31 ;  11:30 ;  31:16 ;  Isaiah 3:10 ;  10:12 ;  Matthew 3:8 ;  21:41 ;  26:29 ;  Hebrews 13:15 ;  Romans 7:4 Romans 7:5 ;  15:28 ).  </p><p> The fruits of the Spirit ( Galatians 5:22 Galatians 5:23 ;  Ephesians 5:9 ;  James 3:17 James 3:18 ) are those gracious dispositions and habits which the Spirit produces in those in whom he dwells and works.  </p> </li>
Frying-pan	<p>(Heb. marhesheth, a "boiler"), a pot for boiling meat ( Leviticus 2:7 ;  7:9 ).  </p>
Fuel	<p>Almost every kind of combustible matter was used for fuel, such as the withered stalks of herbs ( Matthew 6:30 ), thorns ( Psalms 58:9 ; Eccl  7:6 ), animal excrements ( Ezekiel 4:12-15 ;  Ezekiel 15:4 Ezekiel 15:6 ;  21:32 ). Wood or charcoal is much used still in all the towns of Syria and Egypt. It is largely brought from the region of Hebron to Jerusalem. (See COAL .) </p>
Fugitive	<p> Genesis 4:12 Genesis 4:14 , a rover or wanderer (Heb. n'a);  Judges 12:4 , a refugee, one who has escaped (Heb. palit);  2 Kings 25:11 , a deserter, one who has fallen away to the enemy (Heb. nophel);  Ezekiel 17:21 , one who has broken away in flight (Heb. mibrah);  Isaiah 15:5 ;  43:14 , a breaker away, a fugitive (Heb. beriah), one who flees away.  </p>
Fuller	<p>The word "full" is from the Anglo-Saxon fullian, meaning "to whiten." To full is to press or scour cloth in a mill. This art is one of great antiquity. Mention is made of "fuller's soap" ( Malachi 3:2 ), and of "the fuller's field" ( 2 Kings 18:17 ). At his transfiguration our Lord's rainment is said to have been white "so as no fuller on earth could white them" ( Mark 9:3 ). En-rogel (q.v.), meaning literally "foot-fountain," has been interpreted as the "fuller's fountain," because there the fullers trod the cloth with their feet.  </p>
Fullers field	<p>a spot near Jerusalem ( 2 Kings 18:17 ;  Isaiah 36:2 ;  7:3 ), on the side of the highway west of the city, not far distant from the "upper pool" at the head of the valley of Hinnom. Here the fullers pursued their occupation.  </p>
Fullers soap	<p>(Heb. borith mekabbeshim, i.e., "alkali of those treading cloth"). Mention is made ( Proverbs 25:20 ;  Jeremiah 2:22 ) of nitre and also ( Malachi 3:2 ) of soap (Heb. borith) used by the fuller in his operations. Nitre is found in Syria, and vegetable alkali was obtained from the ashes of certain plants. (See SOAP .) </p>
Fulness	<p></p><li> Of time ( Galatians 4:4 ), the time appointed by God, and foretold by the prophets, when Messiah should appear. </li><li> Of Christ ( John 1:16 ), the superabundance of grace with which he was filled. </li><li> Of the Godhead bodily dwelling in Christ ( Colossians 2:9 ), i.e., the whole nature and attributes of God are in Christ. </li><li> Ephesians 1:23 , the church as the fulness of Christ, i.e., the church makes Christ a complete and perfect head.   </li>
Funeral	<p>Burying was among the Jews the only mode of disposing of corpses ( Genesis 23:19 ;  25:9 ;  Genesis 35:8 Genesis 35:9 , etc.).  </p><p> The first traces of burning the dead are found in  1 Samuel 31:12 . The burning of the body was affixed by the law of Moses as a penalty to certain crimes ( Leviticus 20:14 ;  21:9 ).  </p><p> To leave the dead unburied was regarded with horror ( 1 Kings 13:22 ;  14:11 ;  16:4 ;  21:24 , etc.).  </p><p> In the earliest times of which we have record kinsmen carried their dead to the grave ( Genesis 25:9 ;  35:29 ;  Judges 16:31 ), but in later times this was done by others ( Amos 6:16 ).  </p><p> Immediately after decease the body was washed, and then wrapped in a large cloth ( Acts 9:37 ;  Matthew 27:59 ;  Mark 15:46 ). In the case of persons of distinction, aromatics were laid on the folds of the cloth ( John 19:39 ; Compare  John 12:7 ).  </p><p> As a rule the burial (q.v.) took place on the very day of the death ( Acts 5:6 Acts 5:10 ), and the body was removed to the grave in an open coffin or on a bier ( Luke 7:14 ). After the burial a funeral meal was usually given ( 2 Samuel 3:35 ;  Jeremiah 16:5 Jeremiah 16:7 ;  Hosea 9:4 ).  </p>
Furlong	<p>a stadium, a Greek measure of distance equal to 606 feet and 9 inches ( Luke 24:13 ;  John 6:19 ;  11:18 ;  Revelation 14:20 ;  21:16 ).  </p>
Furnace	<p></p><li> Chald. attun, a large furnace with a wide open mouth, at the top of which materials were cast in ( Daniel 3:22 Daniel 3:23 ; Compare  Jeremiah 29:22 ). This furnace would be in constant requisition, for the Babylonians disposed of their dead by cremation, as did also the Accadians who invaded Mesopotamia.  </li><li> Heb. kibshan, a smelting furnace ( Genesis 19:28 ), also a lime-kiln ( Isaiah 33:12 ;  Amos 2:1 ).  </li><li> Heb. kur, a refining furnace ( Proverbs 17:3 ;  27:21 ; Ezek.  22:18 ).  </li><li> Heb. alil, a crucible; only used in  Psalms 12:6 .  </li><li> Heb. tannur, oven for baking bread ( Genesis 15:17 ;  Isaiah 31:9 ;  Nehemiah 3:11 ). It was a large pot, narrowing towards the top. When it was heated by a fire made within, the dough was spread over the heated surface, and thus was baked. "A smoking furnace and a burning lamp" ( Genesis 15:17 ), the symbol of the presence of the Almighty, passed between the divided pieces of Abraham's sacrifice in ratification of the covenant God made with him. (See OVEN .) </li><li> Gr. kamnos, a furnace, kiln, or oven ( Matthew 13:42 Matthew 13:50 ;  Revelation 1:15 ;  9:2 ).   </li>
Furrow	<p>an opening in the ground made by the plough ( Psalms 65:10 ;  Hosea 10:4 Hosea 10:10 ).  </p>
Fury	<p>as attributed to God, is a figurative expression for dispensing afflictive judgments ( Leviticus 26:28 ;  Job 20:23 ;  Isaiah 63:3 ;  Jeremiah 4:4 ;  Ezekiel 5:13 ;  Daniel 9:16 ;  Zechariah 8:2 ).  </p>
Gier eagle	<p>Heb. raham = "parental affection,"  Leviticus 11:18 ;  Deuteronomy 14:17 ; RSV, "vulture"), a species of vulture living entirely on carrion. "It is about the size of a raven; has an almost triangular, bald, and wrinkled head, a strong pointed beak, black at the tip, large eyes and ears, the latter entirely on the outside, and long feet." It is common in Egypt, where it is popularly called "Pharaoh's chicken" (the Neophron percnopterus), and is found in Palestine only during summer. Tristram thinks that the Hebrew name, which is derived from a root meaning "to love," is given to it from the fact that the male and female bird never part company.  </p>
Gift	<p></p><li> An gratuity ( Proverbs 19:6 ) to secure favour ( 18:16 ;  21:14 ), a thank-offering ( Numbers 18:11 ), or a dowry ( Genesis 34:12 ).  </li><li> An oblation or proppitatory gift ( 2 Samuel 8:2 2 Samuel 8:6 ;  1 Chronicles 18:2 1 Chronicles 18:6 ;  2 Ch  26:8 ;  Psalms 45:12 ;  72:10 ).  </li><li> A bribe to a judge to obtain a favourable verdict ( Exodus 23:8 ;  Deuteronomy 16:19 ).  </li><li> Simply a thing given ( Matthew 7:11 ;  Luke 11:13 ;  Ephesians 4:8 ); sacrifical ( Matthew 5:23 Matthew 5:24 ;  8:4 ); eleemosynary ( Luke 21:1 ); a gratuity ( John 4:10 ;  Acts 8:20 ). In  Acts 2:38  the generic word dorea is rendered "gift." It differs from the charisma ( 1 Corinthians 12:4 ) as denoting not miraculous powers but the working of a new spirit in men, and that spirit from God.  <p> The giving of presents entered largely into the affairs of common life in the East. The nature of the presents was as various as were the occasions: food ( 1 Samuel 9:7 ;  16:20 ), sheep and cattle ( Genesis 32:13-15 ), gold ( 2 Samuel 18:11 ), jewels ( Genesis 24:53 ), furniture, and vessels for eating and drinking ( 2 Samuel 17:28 ); delicacies, as spices, honey, etc. ( 1 Kings 10:25 ;  2 Kings  5: :  22 ). The mode of presentation was with as much parade as possible: the presents were conveyed by the hands of servants ( Judges 3:18 ), or still better, on the backs of beasts of burden ( 2 Kings 8:9 ). The refusal of a present was regarded as a high indignity; and this constituted the aggravated insult noticed in  Matthew 22:11 , the marriage robe having been offered and refused.  </p> </li>
Gifts, spiritual	<p>(Gr. charismata), gifts supernaturally bestowed on the early Christians, each having his own proper gift or gifts for the edification of the body of Christ. These were the result of the extraordinary operation of the Spirit, as on the day of Pentecost. They were the gifts of speaking with tongues, casting out devils, healing, etc. ( Mark 16:17 Mark 16:18 ), usually communicated by the medium of the laying on of the hands of the apostles ( Acts 8:17 ;  19:6 ;  1 Timothy 4:14 ). These charismata were enjoyed only for a time. They could not continue always in the Church. They were suited to its infancy and to the necessities of those times.  </p>
Gihon	<p>a stream. </p><li> One of the four rivers of Eden ( Genesis 2:13 ). It has been identified with the Nile. Others regard it as the Oxus, or the Araxes, or the Ganges. But as, according to the sacred narrative, all these rivers of Eden took their origin from the head-waters of the Euphrates and the Trigris, it is probable that the Gihon is the ancient Araxes, which, under the modern name of the Arras, discharges itself into the Caspian Sea. It was the Asiatic and not the African "Cush" which the Gihon compassed ( Genesis 10:7-10 ). (See EDEN .) </li><li> The only natural spring of water in or near Jerusalem is the "Fountain of the Virgin" (q.v.), which rises outside the city walls on the west bank of the Kidron valley. On the occasion of the approach of the Assyrian army under Sennacherib, Hezekiah, in order to prevent the besiegers from finding water, "stopped the upper water course of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David" ( 2 Chronicles 32:30 ;  33:14 ). This "fountain" or spring is therefore to be regarded as the "upper water course of Gihon." From this "fountain" a tunnel cut through the ridge which forms the south part of the temple hill conveys the water to the Pool of Siloam, which lies on the opposite side of this ridge at the head of the Tyropoeon ("cheesemakers'") valley, or valley of the son of Hinnom, now filled up by rubbish. The length of this tunnel is about 1,750 feet. In 1880 an inscription was accidentally discovered on the wall of the tunnel about nineteen feet from where it opens into the Pool of Siloam. This inscription was executed in all probability by Hezekiah's workmen. It briefly narrates the history of the excavation. It may, however, be possible that this tunnel was executed in the time of Solomon. If the "waters of Shiloah that go softly" ( Isaiah 8:6 ) refers to the gentle stream that still flows through the tunnel into the Pool of Siloam, then this excavation must have existed before the time of Hezekiah.  <p> In the upper part of the Tyropoeoan valley there are two pools still existing, the first, called Birket el-Mamilla, to the west of the Jaffa gate; the second, to the south of the first, called Birket es-Sultan. It is the opinion of some that the former was the "upper" and the latter the "lower" Pool of Gihon ( 2 Kings 18:17 ;  Isaiah 7:3 ;  36:2 ;  22:9 ). (See CONDUIT;  SILOAM .) </p> </li>
Gilboa	<p>boiling spring, a mountain range, now Jebel Fukua', memorable as the scene of Saul's disastrous defeat by the Philistines. Here also his three sons were slain, and he himself died by his own hand ( 1 Samuel 28:4 ;  31:1-8 ;  2 Sam  1:6-21 ;  21:12 ;  1 Chronicles 10:1 1 Chronicles 10:8 ). It was a low barren range of mountains bounding the valley of Esdraelon (Jezreel) on the east, between it and the Jordan valley. When the tidings of this defeat were conveyed to David, he gave utterance to those pathetic words in the "Song of the Bow" ( 2 Samuel 1:19-27 ).  </p>
Gilead	<p>hill of testimony, ( Genesis 31:21 ), a mountainous region east of Jordan. From its mountainous character it is called "the mount of Gilead" ( Genesis 31:25 ). It is called also "the land of Gilead" ( Numbers 32:1 ), and sometimes simply "Gilead" ( Psalms 60:7 ;  Genesis 37:25 ). It comprised the possessions of the tribes of Gad and Reuben and the south part of Manasseh ( Deuteronomy 3:13 ;  Numbers 32:40 ). It was bounded on the north by Bashan, and on the south by Moab and Ammon ( Genesis 31:21 ;  Deuteronomy 3:12-17 ). "Half Gilead" was possessed by Sihon, and the other half, separated from it by the river Jabbok, by Og, king of Bashan. The deep ravine of the river Hieromax (the modern Sheriat el-Mandhur) separated Bashan from Gilead, which was about 60 miles in length and 20 in breadth, extending from near the south end of the Lake of Gennesaret to the north end of the Dead Sea. Abarim, Pisgah, Nebo, and Peor are its mountains mentioned in Scripture.  </p>
Gilead, Balm of	<p>The region of Gilead abounded in spices and aromatic gums, which were exported to Egypt and Tyre ( Genesis 37:25 ;  Jeremiah 8:22 ;  46:11 ;  Ezekiel 27:17 ). The word "balm" is a contracted form of "balsam," a word derived from the Greek <i> balsamon</i> , which was adopted as the representative of the Hebrew words <i> baal shemen</i> , meaning "lord" or "chief of oils." </p><p> The Hebrew name of this balm was <i> tsori</i> . The tree yielding this medicinal oil was probably the Balsamodendron opobalsamum of botanists, and the Amyris opobalsamum of Linnaeus. It is an evergreen, rising to the height of about 14 feet. The oil or resin, exuding through an orifice made in its bark in very small quantities, is esteemed of great value for its supposed medicinal qualities. (See BALM .) It may be noted that Coverdale's version reads in  Jeremiah 8:22 , "There is no triacle in Galaad." The word "triacle" = "treacle" is used in the sense of ointment.  </p>
Gilgal	<p>rolling. </p><li> From the solemn transaction of the reading of the law in the valley of Shechem between Ebal and Gerizim the Israelites moved forward to Gilgal, and there made a permanent camp ( Joshua 9:6 ;  10:6 ). It was "beside the oaks of Moreh," near which Abraham erected his first altar ( Genesis 12:6 Genesis 12:7 ). This was one of the three towns to which Samuel resorted for the administration of justice ( 1 Samuel 7:16 ), and here also he offered sacrifices when the ark was no longer in the tabernacle at Shiloh ( 1 Samuel 10:8 ;  13:7-9 ). To this place, as to a central sanctuary, all Israel gathered to renew their allegiance to Saul ( 11:14 ). At a later period it became the scene of idolatrous worship ( Hosea 4:15 ;  9:15 ). It has been identified with the ruins of Jiljilieh, about 5 miles south-west of Shiloh and about the same distance from Bethel.  </li><li> The place in "the plains of Jericho," "in the east border of Jericho," where the Israelites first encamped after crossing the Jordan ( Joshua 4:19 Joshua 4:20 ). Here they kept their first Passover in the land of Canaan ( 5:10 ) and renewed the rite of circumcision, and so "rolled away the reproach" of their Egyptian slavery. Here the twelve memorial stones, taken from the bed of the Jordan, were set up; and here also the tabernacle remained till it was removed to Shiloh ( 18:1 ). It has been identified with Tell Jiljulieh, about 5 miles from Jordan.  </li><li> A place, probably in the hill country of Ephraim, where there was a school of the prophets ( 2 Kings 4:38 ), and whence Elijah and Elisha, who resided here, "went down" to Bethel ( 2 Kings 2:1 2 Kings 2:2 ). It is mentioned also in  Deuteronomy 11:30 . It is now known as Jiljilia, a place 8 miles north of Bethel.   </li>
Giloh	<p>exile, a city in the south-west part of the hill-country of Judah ( Joshua 15:51 ). It was the native place or residence of the traitor Ahithophel "the Gilonite" ( Joshua 15:51 ;  2 Sam  15:12 ), and where he committed suicide ( <span class="badLink">17:23</span> ). It has been identified with Kurbet Jala, about 7 miles north of Hebron.  </p>
Gimzo	<p>a place fertile in sycamores, a city in the plain of Judah, the villages of which were seized by the Philistines ( 2 Chronicles 28:18 ). It is now called Jimzu, about 3 miles south-east of Ludd, i.e., Lydda.  </p>
Gin	<p>a trap. </p><li> Psalms 140:5 Psalms 141:9 ,  Amos 3:5 , the Hebrew word used, <i> mokesh</i> , means a noose or "snare," as it is elsewhere rendered ( Psalms 18:5 ;  Proverbs 13:14 , etc.).  </li><li> Job 18:9 ,  Isaiah 8:14 , Heb. pah, a plate or thin layer; and hence a net, a snare, trap, especially of a fowler ( Psalms 69: :  22 , "Let their table before them become a net;"  Amos 3:5 , "Doth a bird fall into a net [pah] upon the ground where there is no trap-stick [mokesh] for her? doth the net [pah] spring up from the ground and take nothing at all?", Gesenius.)   </li>
Girdle	<p></p><li> Heb. hagor, a girdle of any kind worn by soldiers ( 1 Samuel 18:4 ;  2 Sam  20:8 ;  1 Kings 2:5 ;  2 Kings  3:21 ) or women ( Isaiah 3:24 ).  </li><li> Heb. 'ezor, something "bound," worn by prophets ( 2 Kings 1:8 ;  Jeremiah 13:1 ), soldiers ( Isaiah 5:27 ;  2 Sam  20:8 ;  Ezekiel 23:15 ), Kings ( Job 12:18 ).  </li><li> Heb. mezah, a "band," a girdle worn by men alone ( Psalms 109:19 ;  Isaiah 22:21 ).  </li><li> Heb. 'abnet, the girdle of sacerdotal and state officers ( Exodus 28:4 Exodus 28:39 Exodus 28:40 ;  29:9 ;  39:29 ).  </li><li> Heb. hesheb, the "curious girdle" ( Exodus 28:8 ; RSV, "cunningly woven band") was attached to the ephod, and was made of the same material.  <p> The common girdle was made of leather ( 2 Kings 1:8 ;  Matthew 3:4 ); a finer sort of linen ( Jeremiah 13:1 ;  Ezekiel 16:10 ;  Daniel 10:5 ). Girdles of sackcloth were worn in token of sorrow ( Isaiah 3:24 ;  22:12 ). They were variously fastened to the wearer ( Mark 1:6 ;  Jeremiah 13:1 ;  Ezekiel 16:10 ).  </p><p> The girdle was a symbol of strength and power ( Job 12:18 Job 12:21 ;  30:11 ;  Isaiah 22:21 ;  45:5 ). "Righteousness and faithfulness" are the girdle of the Messiah ( Isaiah 11:5 ).  </p><p> Girdles were used as purses or pockets ( Matthew 10:9 . A. V., "purses;" RSV, marg., "girdles." Also  Mark 6:8 ).  </p> </li>
Girgashite	<p>dwelling in clayey soil, the descendants of the fifth son of Canaan ( Genesis 10:16 ), one of the original tribes inhabiting the land of Canaan before the time of the Israelites ( Genesis 15:21 ;  Deuteronomy 7:1 ). They were a branch of the great family of the Hivites. Of their geographical position nothing is certainly known. Probably they lived somewhere in the central part of Western Palestine.  </p>
Gittah-hepher	<p>( Joshua 19:13 ). See GATH-HEPHER.  </p>
Gittaim	<p>two wine-presses, ( 2 Samuel 4:3 ;  Nehemiah 11:33 ), a town probably in Benjamin to which the Beerothites fled.  </p>
Gittite	<p>a native of the Philistine city of Gath ( Joshua 13:3 ). Obed-edom, in whose house the ark was placed, is so designated ( 2 Samuel 6:10 ). Six hundred Gittites came with David from Gath into Israel ( 2 Samuel 15:18 2 Samuel 15:19 ).  </p>
Gittith	<p>a stringed instrument of music. This word is found in the titles of  Psalms 88184 ,81,84. In these places the LXX. render the word by "on the wine-fats." The Targum explains by "on the harp which David brought from Gath." It is the only stringed instrument named in the titles of the Psalms.  </p>
Gizonite	<p>a name given to Hashem, an inhabitant of Gizoh, a place somewhere in the mountains of Judah ( 1 Chronicles 11:34 ;  2 Sam  1 Chronicles 23:32  1 Chronicles 23:34 ).  </p>
Glass	<p>was known to the Egyptians at a very early period of their national history, at least B.C. 1500. Various articles both useful and ornamental were made of it, as bottles, vases, etc. A glass bottle with the name of Sargon on it was found among the ruins of the north-west palace of Nimroud. The Hebrew word <i> zekukith</i> ( Job 28:17 ), rendered in the Authorized Version "crystal," is rightly rendered in the Revised Version "glass." This is the only allusion to glass found in the Old Testament. It is referred to in the New Testament in  Revelation 4:6 ;  15:2 ;  Revelation 21:18 Revelation 21:21 . In  Job 37:18 , the word rendered "looking-glass" is in the Revised Version properly rendered "mirror," formed, i.e., of some metal. (Compare  Exodus 38:8 : "looking-glasses" are brazen mirrors, RSV). A mirror is referred to also in  James 1:23 .  </p>
Glean	<p>The corners of fields were not to be reaped, and the sheaf accidentally left behind was not to be fetched away, according to the law of Moses ( Leviticus 19:9 ;  23:22 ;  Deuteronomy 24:21 ). They were to be left for the poor to glean. Similar laws were given regarding vineyards and oliveyards. (Compare  Ruth 2:2 .)  </p>
Glede	<p>an Old English name for the common kite, mentioned only in  Deuteronomy 14:13  (Heb. ra'ah), the Milvus ater or black kite. The Hebrew word does not occur in the parallel passage in ( Leviticus 11:14 , da'ah, rendered "vulture;" in RSV, "kite"). It was an unclean bird. The Hebrew name is from a root meaning "to see," "to look," thus designating a bird with a keen sight. The bird intended is probably the buzzard, of which there are three species found in Palestine. (See VULTURE .) </p>
Glorify	<p></p><li> To make glorious, or cause so to appear ( John 12:28 ;  John 13:31 John 13:32 ;  John 17:4 John 17:5 ).  </li><li> Spoken of God to "shew forth his praise" ( 1 Corinthians 6:20 ;  10:31 ).   </li>
Glory	<p>(Heb. kabhod; Gr. doxa). </p><li> Abundance, wealth, treasure, and hence honour ( Psalms 49:12 ); glory ( Genesis 31:1 ;  Matthew 4:8 ;  Revelation 21:24 Revelation 21:26 ).  </li><li> Honour, dignity ( 1 Kings 3:13 ;  Hebrews 2:7 1 Peter 1:24 ); of God ( Psalms 19:1 ;  29:1 ); of the mind or heart ( Genesis 49:6 ;  Psalms 7:5 ;  Acts 2:46 ).  </li><li> Splendour, brightness, majesty ( Genesis 45:13 ;  Isaiah 4:5 ;  Acts 22:11 ;  2 co  3:7 ); of Jehovah ( Isaiah 59:19 ;  60:1 ;  2 th.  1:9 ).  </li><li> The glorious moral attributes, the infinite perfections of God ( Isaiah 40:5 ;  Acts 7:2 ;  Romans 1:23 ;  9:23 ;  Ephesians 1:12 ). Jesus is the "brightness of the Father's glory" ( Hebrews 1:3 ;  John 1:14 ;  2:11 ).  </li><li> The bliss of heaven ( Romans 2:7 Romans 2:10 ;  5:2 ;  8:18 ;  Hebrews 2:10 ;  1 Peter 5:1 1 Peter 5:10 ).  </li><li> The phrase "Give glory to God" ( Joshua 7:19 ;  Jeremiah 13:16 ) is a Hebrew idiom meaning, "Confess your sins." The words of the Jews to the blind man, "Give God the praise" ( John 9:24 ), are an adjuration to confess. They are equivalent to, "Confess that you are an impostor," "Give God the glory by speaking the truth;" for they denied that a miracle had been wrought.   </li>
Glutton	<p>( Deuteronomy 21:20 ), Heb. zolel, from a word meaning "to shake out," "to squander;" and hence one who is prodigal, who wastes his means by indulgence. In  Proverbs 23:21 , the word means debauchees or wasters of their own body. In  Proverbs 28:7 , the word (pl.) is rendered Authorized Version "riotous men;" Revised Version, "gluttonous."  Matthew 11:19 ,  Luke 7:34 , Greek phagos, given to eating, gluttonous.  </p>
Gnash	<p>Heb. harak, meaning "to grate the teeth", ( Job 16:9 ;  Psalms 112:10 ;  Lamentations 2:16 ), denotes rage or sorrow. (See also  Acts 7:54 ;  Mark 9:18 .)  </p>
Gnat	<p>only in  Matthew 23:24 , a small two-winged stinging fly of the genus Culex, which includes mosquitoes. Our Lord alludes here to the gnat in a proverbial expression probably in common use, "who strain out the gnat;" the words in the Authorized Version, "strain at a gnat," being a mere typographical error, which has been corrected in the Revised Version. The custom of filtering wine for this purpose was common among the Jews. It was founded on  Leviticus 11:23 . It is supposed that the "lice,"  Exodus 8:16  (marg. RSV, "sand-flies"), were a species of gnat.  </p>
Goad	<p>(Heb. malmad, only in  Judges 3: :  31 ), an instrument used by ploughmen for guiding their oxen. Shamgar slew six hundred Philistines with an ox-goad. "The goad is a formidable weapon. It is sometimes ten feet long, and has a sharp point. We could now see that the feat of Shamgar was not so very wonderful as some have been accustomed to think."  </p><p> In  1 Samuel 13:21 , a different Hebrew word is used, <i> dorban</i> , meaning something pointed. The expression ( Acts 9:5 , omitted in the RSV), "It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks", i.e., against the goad, was proverbial for unavailing resistance to superior power.  </p>
Goat	<p></p><li> Heb. 'ez, the she-goat ( Genesis 15:9 ;  30:35 ;  31:38 ). This Hebrew word is also used for the he-goat ( Exodus 12:5 ;  Leviticus 4:23 ;  Numbers 28:15 ), and to denote a kid ( Genesis 38:17 Genesis 38:20 ). Hence it may be regarded as the generic name of the animal as domesticated. It literally means "strength," and points to the superior strength of the goat as compared with the sheep.  </li><li> Heb. 'attud, only in plural; rendered "rams" ( Genesis 31:10 Genesis 31:12 ); he-goats ( Numbers 7:17-88 ;  Isaiah 1:11 ); goats ( Deuteronomy 32:14 ;  Psalms 50:13 ). They were used in sacrifice ( Psalms 66:15 ). This word is used metaphorically for princes or chiefs in  Isaiah 14:9 , and in  Zechariah 10:3  as leaders. (Compare  Jeremiah 50:8 .)  </li><li> Heb. gedi, properly a kid. Its flesh was a delicacy among the Hebrews ( Genesis 27:9 Genesis 27:14 Genesis 27:17 ;  Judges 6:19 ).  </li><li> Heb. sa'ir, meaning the "shaggy," a hairy goat, a he-goat ( 2 Chronicles 29:23 ); "a goat" ( Leviticus 4:24 ); "satyr" ( Isaiah 13:21 ); "devils" ( Leviticus 17:7 ). It is the goat of the sin-offering ( Leviticus 9:3 Leviticus 9:15 ;  10:16 ).  </li><li> Heb. tsaphir, a he-goat of the goats ( 2 Chronicles 29:21 ). In Dan 8:5,8it is used as a symbol of the Macedonian empire.  </li><li> Heb. tayish, a "striker" or "butter," rendered "he-goat" ( Genesis 30:35 ;  32:14 ).  </li><li> Heb. 'azazel (q.v.), the "scapegoat" ( Leviticus 16:8 Leviticus 16:10 Leviticus 16:26 ).  </li><li> There are two Hebrew words used to denote the undomesticated goat:, <i> Yael</i> , only in plural mountain goats ( 1 Samuel 24:2 ;  Job 39:1 ; Ps.104:18). It is derived from a word meaning "to climb." It is the ibex, which abounded in the mountainous parts of Moab. And <i> 'akko</i> , only in  Deuteronomy 14:5 , the wild goat.  <p> Goats are mentioned in the New Testament in  Matthew 25:32 Matthew 25:33 ;  Hebrews 9:12 Hebrews 9:13 Hebrews 9:19 ;  10:4 . They represent oppressors and wicked men ( Ezekiel 34:17 ;  39:18 ;  Matthew 25:33 ).  </p><p> Several varieties of the goat were familiar to the Hebrews. They had an important place in their rural economy on account of the milk they afforded and the excellency of the flesh of the kid. They formed an important part of pastoral wealth ( Genesis 31:10 Genesis 31:12 Genesis 32:14 ;  1 Samuel 25:2 ).  </p> </li>
Goath	<p>a lowing, a place near Jerusalem, mentioned only in  Jeremiah 31:39 .  </p>
Gob	<p>a pit, a place mentioned in  2 Samuel 21:18 2 Samuel 21:19 ; called also Gezer, in  1 Chronicles 20:4 .  </p>
Goblet	<p>a laver or trough for washing garments. In Cant  7:2 , a bowl or drinking vessel, a bowl for mixing wine; in  Exodus 24:6 , a sacrificial basin. (See CUP .) </p>
God	<p>(A.S. and Dutch God; Dan. Gud; Ger. Gott), the name of the Divine Being. It is the rendering (1) of the Hebrew <i> 'El</i> , from a word meaning to be strong; (2) of <i> 'Eloah_, plural _'Elohim</i> . The singular form, <i> Eloah</i> , is used only in poetry. The plural form is more commonly used in all parts of the Bible, The Hebrew word Jehovah (q.v.), the only other word generally employed to denote the Supreme Being, is uniformly rendered in the Authorized Version by "LORD," printed in small capitals. The existence of God is taken for granted in the Bible. There is nowhere any argument to prove it. He who disbelieves this truth is spoken of as one devoid of understanding ( Psalms 14:1 ).  </p><p> The arguments generally adduced by theologians in proof of the being of God are: </p><li> The a priori argument, which is the testimony afforded by reason.  </li><li> The a posteriori argument, by which we proceed logically from the facts of experience to causes. These arguments are,  <p> (a) The cosmological, by which it is proved that there must be a First Cause of all things, for every effect must have a cause. </p><p> (b) The teleological, or the argument from design. We see everywhere the operations of an intelligent Cause in nature. </p><p> (c) The moral argument, called also the anthropological argument, based on the moral consciousness and the history of mankind, which exhibits a moral order and purpose which can only be explained on the supposition of the existence of God. Conscience and human history testify that "verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth." </p><p> The attributes of God are set forth in order by Moses in  Exodus 34:6 Exodus 34:7 . (see also  Deuteronomy 6:4 ;  10:17 ;  Numbers 16:22 ;  Exodus 15:11 ;  33:19 ;  Isaiah 44:6 ;  Habakkuk 3:6 ;  Psalms 102:26 ;  Job 34:12 .) They are also systematically classified in  Revelation 5:12  and  7:12 .  </p><p> God's attributes are spoken of by some as absolute, i.e., such as belong to his essence as Jehovah, Jah, etc.; and relative, i.e., such as are ascribed to him with relation to his creatures. Others distinguish them into communicable, i.e., those which can be imparted in degree to his creatures: goodness, holiness, wisdom, etc.; and incommunicable, which cannot be so imparted: independence, immutability, immensity, and eternity. They are by some also divided into natural attributes, eternity, immensity, etc.; and moral, holiness, goodness, etc. </p> </li>
Godhead	<p>( Acts 17:29 ;  Romans 1:20 ;  Colossians 2:9 ), the essential being or the nature of God.  </p>
Godliness	<p>the whole of practical piety ( 1 Timothy 4:8 ;  2 Pet  1:6 ). "It supposes knowledge, veneration, affection, dependence, submission, gratitude, and obedience." In  1 Timothy 3:16  it denotes the substance of revealed religion.  </p>
Goel	<p>in Hebrew the participle of the verb <i> gaal</i> , "to redeem." It is rendered in the Authorized Version "kinsman,"  Numbers 5:8 ;  Ruth 3:12 ;  Ruth 4:1 Ruth 4:6 Ruth 4:8 ; "redeemer,"  Job 19:25 ; "avenger,"  Numbers 35:12 ;  Deuteronomy 19:6 , etc. The Jewish law gave the right of redeeming and repurchasing, as well as of avenging blood, to the next relative, who was accordingly called by this name. (See REDEEMER .) </p>
Gog	<p></p><li> A Reubenite ( 1 Chronicles 5:4 ), the father of Shimei.  </li><li> The name of the leader of the hostile party described in Ezek. 38,39, as coming from the "north country" and assailing the people of Israel to their own destruction. This prophecy has been regarded as fulfilled in the conflicts of the Maccabees with Antiochus, the invasion and overthrow of the Chaldeans, and the temporary successes and destined overthrow of the Turks. But "all these interpretations are unsatisfactory and inadequate. The vision respecting Gog and Magog in the Apocalypse ( Revelation 20:8 ) is in substance a reannouncement of this prophecy of Ezekiel. But while Ezekiel contemplates the great conflict in a more general light as what was certainly to be connected with the times of the Messiah, and should come then to its last decisive issues, John, on the other hand, writing from the commencement of the Messiah's times, describes there the last struggles and victories of the cause of Christ. In both cases alike the vision describes the final workings of the world's evil and its results in connection with the kingdom of God, only the starting-point is placed further in advance in the one case than in the other."  <p> It has been supposed to be the name of a district in the wild north-east steppes of Central Asia, north of the Hindu-Kush, now a part of Turkestan, a region about 2,000 miles north-east of Nineveh.  </p> </li>
Golan	<p>exile, a city of Bashan ( Deuteronomy 4:43 ), one of the three cities of refuge east of Jordan, about 12 miles north-east of the Sea of Galilee ( Joshua 20:8 ). There are no further notices of it in Scripture. It became the head of the province of Gaulanitis, one of the four provinces into which Bashan was divided after the Babylonish captivity, and almost identical with the modern Jaulan, in Western Hauran, about 39 miles in length and 18 in breath.  </p>
Gold	<p></p><li> Heb. zahab, so called from its yellow colour ( Exodus 25:11 ;  1 Chronicles 28:18 ;  2 Chr  3:5 ).  </li><li> Heb. segor, from its compactness, or as being enclosed or treasured up; thus precious or "fine gold" ( 1 Kings 6:20 ;  7:49 ).  </li><li> Heb. paz, native or pure gold ( Job 28:17 ;  Psalms 19:10 ;  21:3 , etc.).  </li><li> Heb. betzer, "ore of gold or silver" as dug out of the mine ( Job 36:19 , where it means simply riches).  </li><li> Heb. kethem, i.e., something concealed or separated ( Job 28:16 Job 28:19 ;  Psalms 45:9 ;  Proverbs 25:12 ). Rendered "golden wedge" in  Isaiah 13:12 .  </li><li> Heb. haruts, i.e., dug out; poetic for gold ( Proverbs 8:10 ;  16:16 ;  Zechariah 9:3 ).  <p> Gold was known from the earliest times ( Genesis 2:11 ). It was principally used for ornaments ( Genesis 24:22 ). It was very abundant ( 1 Chronicles 22:14 ;  Nahum 2:9 ;  Daniel 3:1 ). Many tons of it were used in connection with the temple ( 2 Chronicles 1:15 ). It was found in Arabia, Sheba, and Ophir ( 1 Kings 9:28 ;  10:1 ;  Job 28:16 ), but not in Palestine.  </p><p> In  Daniel 2:38 , the Babylonian Empire is spoken of as a "head of gold" because of its great riches; and Babylon was called by ( Isaiah 14:4 ) the "golden city" (RSV marg., "exactress," adopting the reading <i> marhebah</i> , instead of the usual word <i> madhebah</i> ). </p> </li>
Golden calf	<p>( Exodus 32:4 Exodus 32:8 ;  Deuteronomy 9:16 ;  Nehemiah 9:18 ). This was a molten image of a calf which the idolatrous Israelites formed at Sinai. This symbol was borrowed from the custom of the Egyptians. It was destroyed at the command of Moses ( Exodus 32:20 ). (See AARON;  MOSES .) </p>
Goldsmith	<p>( Nehemiah 3:8 Nehemiah 3:32 ;  Isaiah 40:19 ;  41:7 ;  46:6 ). The word so rendered means properly a founder or finer.  </p>
Golgotha	<p>the common name of the spot where Jesus was crucified. It is interpreted by the evangelists as meaning "the place of a skull" ( Matthew 27:33 ;  Mark 15:22 ;  John 19:17 ). This name represents in Greek letters the Aramaic word Gulgaltha, which is the Hebrew Gulgoleth ( Numbers 1:2 ;  1 Chronicles 23:3 1 Chronicles 23:24 ;  2 Kings  9:35 ), meaning "a skull." It is identical with the word Calvary (q.v.). It was a little knoll rounded like a bare skull. It is obvious from the evangelists that it was some well-known spot outside the gate (Compare  Hebrews 13:12 ), and near the city ( Luke 23:26 ), containing a "garden" ( John 19:41 ), and on a thoroughfare leading into the country. Hence it is an untenable idea that it is embraced within the present "Church of the Holy Sepulchre." The hillock above Jeremiah's Grotto, to the north of the city, is in all probability the true site of Calvary. The skull-like appearance of the rock in the southern precipice of the hillock is very remarkable.  </p>
Goliath	<p>great. </p><li> A famous giant of Gath, who for forty days openly defied the armies of Israel, but was at length slain by David with a stone from a sling ( 1 Samuel 17:4 ). He was probably descended from the Rephaim who found refuge among the Philistines after they were dispersed by the Ammonites ( Deuteronomy 2:20 Deuteronomy 2:21 ). His height was "six cubits and a span," which, taking the cubit at 21 inches, is equal to 10 1/2 feet. David cut off his head ( 1 Samuel 17:51 ) and brought it to Jerusalem, while he hung the armour which he took from him in his tent. His sword was preserved at Nob as a religious trophy ( 21:9 ). David's victory over Goliath was the turning point in his life. He came into public notice now as the deliverer of Israel and the chief among Saul's men of war ( 18:5 ), and the devoted friend of Jonathan.  </li><li> In  2 Samuel 21:19  there is another giant of the same name mentioned as slain by Elhanan. The staff of his apear "was like a weaver's beam." The Authorized Version interpolates the words "the brother of" from  1 Chronicles 20:5 , where this giant is called Lahmi.   </li>
Gomer	<p>complete; vanishing. </p><li> The daughter of Diblaim, who (probably in vision only) became the wife of ( Hosea 1:3 ).  </li><li> The eldest son of Japheth, and father of Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah ( Genesis 10:2 Genesis 10:3 ), whose descendants formed the principal branch of the population of South-eastern Europe. He is generally regarded as the ancestor of the Celtae and the Cimmerii, who in early times settled to the north of the Black Sea, and gave their name to the Crimea, the ancient Chersonesus Taurica. Traces of their presence are found in the names Cimmerian Bosphorus, Cimmerian Isthmus, etc. In the seventh century B.C. they were driven out of their original seat by the Scythians, and overran western Asia Minor, whence they were afterwards expelled. They subsequently reappear in the times of the Romans as the Cimbri of the north and west of Europe, whence they crossed to the British Isles, where their descendants are still found in the Gaels and Cymry. Thus the whole Celtic race may be regarded as descended from Gomer.   </li>
Gomorrah	<p>submersion, one of the five cities of the plain of Siddim (q.v.) which were destroyed by fire ( Genesis 10:19 ;  13:10 ;  Genesis 19:24 Genesis 19:28 ). These cities probably stood close together, and were near the northern extremity of what is now the Dead Sea. This city is always mentioned next after Sodom, both of which were types of impiety and wickedness ( Genesis 18:20 ;  Romans 9:29 ). Their destruction is mentioned as an "ensample unto those that after should live ungodly" ( 2 Peter 2:6 ;  Jude 1:4-7 ). Their wickedness became proverbial ( Deuteronomy 32:32 ;  Isaiah 1:9 Isaiah 1:10 ;  Jeremiah 23:14 ). But that wickedness may be exceeded ( Matthew 10:15 ;  Mark 6:11 ). (See DEAD SEA).  </p>
Goodly trees	<p>boughs of, were to be carried in festive procession on the first day of the feast of Tabernacles ( Leviticus 23:40 ). This was probably the olive tree ( Nehemiah 8:15 ), although no special tree is mentioned.  </p>
Goodness	<p>in man is not a mere passive quality, but the deliberate preference of right to wrong, the firm and persistent resistance of all moral evil, and the choosing and following of all moral good. </p>
Goodness of God	<p>a perfection of his character which he exercises towards his creatures according to their various circumstances and relations ( Psalms 145:8 Psalms 145:9 ;  103:8 ;  1 John 4:8 ). Viewed generally, it is benevolence; as exercised with respect to the miseries of his creatures it is mercy, pity, compassion, and in the case of impenitent sinners, long-suffering patience; as exercised in communicating favour on the unworthy it is grace. "Goodness and justice are the several aspects of one unchangeable, infinitely wise, and sovereign moral perfection. God is not sometimes merciful and sometimes just, but he is eternally infinitely just and merciful." God is infinitely and unchangeably good ( Zephaniah 3:17 ), and his goodness is incomprehensible by the finite mind ( Romans 11: :  3536 ,36). "God's goodness appears in two things, giving and forgiving."  </p>
Gopher	<p>a tree from the wood of which Noah was directed to build the ark ( Genesis 6:14 ). It is mentioned only there. The LXX. render this word by "squared beams," and the Vulgate by "planed wood." Other versions have rendered it "pine" and "cedar;" but the weight of authority is in favour of understanding by it the cypress tree, which grows abundantly in Chaldea and Armenia.  </p>
Goshen	<p></p><li> A district in Egypt where Jacob and his family settled, and in which they remained till the Exodus ( Genesis 45:10 ;  Genesis 46:28 Genesis 46:29 Genesis 46:31 , etc.). It is called "the land of Goshen" ( 47:27 ), and also simply "Goshen" ( 46:28 ), and "the land of Rameses" ( 47:11 ;  Exodus 12:37 ), for the towns Pithom and Rameses lay within its borders; also Zoan or Tanis ( Psalms 78:12 ). It lay on the east of the Nile, and apparently not far from the royal residence. It was "the best of the land" ( Genesis 47:6 Genesis 47:11 ), but is now a desert. It is first mentioned in Joseph's message to his father. It has been identified with the modern Wady Tumilat, lying between the eastern part of the Delta and the west border of Palestine. It was a pastoral district, where some of the king's cattle were kept ( Genesis 47:6 ). The inhabitants were not exclusively Israelites ( Exodus 3:22 ;  11:2 ;  Exodus 12:35 Exodus 12:36 ).  </li><li> A district in Palestine ( Joshua 10:41 ;  11:16 ). It was a part of the maritime plain of Judah, and lay between Gaza and Gibeon.  </li><li> A town in the mountains of Judah ( Joshua 15:51 ).   </li>
Gospel	<p>a word of Anglo-Saxon origin, and meaning "God's spell", i.e., word of God, or rather, according to others, "good spell", i.e., good news. It is the rendering of the Greek <i> evangelion</i> , i.e., "good message." It denotes (1) "the welcome intelligence of salvation to man as preached by our Lord and his followers. </p><li> It was afterwards transitively applied to each of the four histories of our Lord's life, published by those who are therefore called 'Evangelists', writers of the history of the gospel (the evangelion). </li><li> The term is often used to express collectively the gospel doctrines; and 'preaching the gospel' is often used to include not only the proclaiming of the good tidings, but the teaching men how to avail themselves of the offer of salvation, the declaring of all the truths, precepts, promises, and threatenings of Christianity." It is termed "the gospel of the grace of God" ( Acts 20:24 ), "the gospel of the kingdom" ( Matthew 4:23 ), "the gospel of Christ" ( Romans 1:16 ), "the gospel of peace ( Ephesians 6:15 ), "the glorious gospel," "the everlasting gospel," "the gospel of salvation" ( Ephesians 1:13 ).   </li>
Gospels	<p>The central fact of Christian preaching was the intelligence that the Saviour had come into the world ( Matthew 4:23 ;  Romans 10:15 ); and the first Christian preachers who called their account of the person and mission of Christ by the term <i> evangelion_ (= good message) were called _evangelistai</i> (= evangelists) ( Ephesians 4:11 ;  Acts 21:8 ).  </p><p> There are four historical accounts of the person and work of Christ: "the first by Matthew, announcing the Redeemer as the promised King of the kingdom of God; the second by Mark, declaring him 'a prophet, mighty in deed and word'; the third by Luke, of whom it might be said that he represents Christ in the special character of the Saviour of sinners ( Luke 7:36 ;  15:18 ); the fourth by John, who represents Christ as the Son of God, in whom deity and humanity become one. The ancient Church gave to Matthew the symbol of the lion, to Mark that of a man, to Luke that of the ox, and to John that of the eagle: these were the four faces of the cherubim" ( Ezekiel 1:10 ).  </p><p> Date. The Gospels were all composed during the latter part of the first century, and there is distinct historical evidence to show that they were used and accepted as authentic before the end of the second century. </p><p> Mutual relation. "If the extent of all the coincidences be represented by 100, their proportionate distribution will be: Matthew, Mark, and Luke, 53; Matthew and Luke, 21; Matthew and Mark, 20; Mark and Luke, 6. Looking only at the general result, it may be said that of the contents of the synoptic Gospels [i.e., the first three Gospels] about two-fifths are common to the three, and that the parts peculiar to one or other of them are little more than one-third of the whole."  </p><p> Origin. Did the evangelists copy from one another? The opinion is well founded that the Gospels were published by the apostles orally before they were committed to writing, and that each had an independent origin. (See MATTHEW, GOSPEL OF .) </p>
Gourd	<p></p><li> Jonah's gourd ( Jonah 4:6-10 ), bearing the Hebrew name <i> kikayon</i> (found only here), was probably the kiki of the Egyptians, the croton. This is the castor-oil plant, a species of ricinus, the palma Christi, so called from the palmate division of its leaves. Others with more probability regard it as the cucurbita the el-keroa of the Arabs, a kind of pumpkin peculiar to the East. "It is grown in great abundance on the alluvial banks of the Tigris and on the plain between the river and the ruins of Nineveh." At the present day it is trained to run over structures of mud and brush to form boots to protect the gardeners from the heat of the noon-day sun. It grows with extraordinary rapidity, and when cut or injured withers away also with great rapidity. </li><li> Wild gourds ( 2 Kings 4:38-40 ), Heb. pakkuoth, belong to the family of the cucumber-like plants, some of which are poisonous. The species here referred to is probably the colocynth (Cucumis colocynthus). The LXX. render the word by "wild pumpkin." It abounds in the desert parts of Syria, Egypt, and Arabia. There is, however, another species, called the Cucumis prophetarum, from the idea that it afforded the gourd which "the sons of the prophets" shred by mistake into their pottage.   </li>
Government of God	<p>See PROVIDENCE . </p>
Governments	<p>( 1 Corinthians 12:28 ), the powers which fit a man for a place of influence in the church; "the steersman's art; the art of guiding aright the vessel of church or state."  </p>
Governor	<p></p><li> Heb. nagid, a prominent, conspicuous person, whatever his capacity: as, chief of the royal palace ( 2 Chronicles 28:7 ; Compare  1 Kings 4:6 ), chief of the temple ( 1 Chronicles 9:11 ;  Jeremiah 20:1 ), the leader of the Aaronites ( 1 Chronicles 12:27 ), keeper of the sacred treasury ( 26:24 ), captain of the army ( 13:1 ), the king ( 1 Samuel 9:16 ), the Messiah ( Daniel 9:25 ).  </li><li> Heb. nasi, raised; exalted. Used to denote the chiefs of families ( Numbers 3:24 Numbers 3:30 Numbers 3:32 Numbers 3:35 ); also of tribes ( 2:3 ;  7:2 ;  3:32 ). These dignities appear to have been elective, not hereditary.  </li><li> Heb. pakid, an officer or magistrate. It is used of the delegate of the high priest ( 2 Chronicles 24:11 ), the Levites ( Nehemiah 11:22 ), a military commander ( 2 Kings 25:19 ), Joseph's officers in Egypt ( Genesis 41:34 ).  </li><li> Heb. shallit, one who has power, who rules ( Genesis 42:6 ;  Ezra 4:20 ; Eccl  8:8 ;  Daniel 2:15 ;  5:29 ).  </li><li> Heb. aluph, literally one put over a thousand, i.e., a clan or a subdivision of a tribe. Used of the "dukes" of Edom ( Genesis 36 ), and of the Jewish chiefs ( Zechariah 9:7 ).  </li><li> Heb. moshel, one who rules, holds dominion. Used of many classes of rulers ( Genesis 3:16 ;  24:2 ;  45:8 ;  Psalms 105:20 ); of the Messiah ( Micah 5:2 ); of God ( 1 Chronicles 29:12 ;  Psalms 103:19 ).  </li><li> Heb. sar, a ruler or chief; a word of very general use. It is used of the chief baker of Pharaoh ( Genesis 40:16 ); of the chief butler ( 40:2 , etc. See also  Genesis 47:6 ;  Exodus 1:11 ;  Daniel 1:7 ;  Judges 10:18 ;  1 Kings 22:26 ;  20:15 ;  2 Kings  1:9 ;  2 Sam  24:2 ). It is used also of angels, guardian angels ( Daniel 10:13 Daniel 10:20 Daniel 10:21 ;  12:1 ;  10:13 ;  8:25 ).  </li><li> Pehah, whence <i> pasha</i> , i.e., friend of the king; adjutant; governor of a province ( 2 Kings 18:24 ;  Isaiah 36:9 ;  Jeremiah 51: :  57 ;  Ezekiel 23:6 Ezekiel 23:23 ;  Daniel 3:2 ;  Esther 3: :  12 ), or a perfect ( Nehemiah 3:7 ;  5:14 ;  Ezra 5:3 ;  Haggai 1:1 ). This is a foreign word, Assyrian, which was early adopted into the Hebrew idiom ( 1 Kings 10:15 ).  </li><li> The Chaldean word <i> segan</i> is applied to the governors of the Babylonian satrapies ( Daniel 3:2 Daniel 3:27 ;  6:7 ); the prefects over the Magi ( 2:48 ). The corresponding Hebrew word <i> segan</i> is used of provincial rulers ( Jeremiah 51:23 Jeremiah 51:28 Jeremiah 51:57 ); also of chiefs and rulers of the people of Jerusalem ( Ezra 9:2 ;  Nehemiah 2:16 ;  Nehemiah 4:14 Nehemiah 4:19 ;  Nehemiah 5:7 Nehemiah 5:17 ;  7:5 ;  12:40 ).  <p> In the New Testament there are also different Greek words rendered thus. </p></li><li> Meaning an ethnarch ( 2 Corinthians 11:32 ), which was an office distinct from military command, with considerable latitude of application.  </li><li> The procurator of Judea under the Romans ( Matthew 27:2 ). (Compare  Luke 2:2 , where the verb from which the Greek word so rendered is derived is used.)  </li><li> Steward ( Galatians 4:2 ).  </li><li> Governor of the feast ( John 2:9 ), who appears here to have been merely an intimate friend of the bridegroom, and to have presided at the marriage banquet in his stead.  </li><li> A director, i.e., helmsman; Lat. gubernator, ( James 3:4 ).   </li>
Gozan	<p>a region in Central Asia to which the Israelites were carried away captive ( 2 Kings 17:6 ;  1 Chronicles 5:26 ;  2 Kings  19:12 ;  Isaiah 37:12 ). It was situated in Mesopotamia, on the river Habor ( 2 Kings 17:6 ;  18:11 ), the Khabur, a tributary of the Euphrates. The "river of Gozan" ( 1 Chronicles 5:26 ) is probably the upper part of the river flowing through the province of Gozan, now Kizzel-Ozan.  </p>
Grace	<p></p><li> Of form or person ( Proverbs 1:9 ;  3:22 ;  Psalms 45:2 ). </li><li> Favour, kindness, friendship ( Genesis 6:8 ;  18:3 ;  19:19 ;  2 Tim  1:9 ). </li><li> God's forgiving mercy ( Romans 11:6 ;  Ephesians 2:5 ). </li><li> The gospel as distinguished from the law ( John 1:17 ;  Romans 6:14 ;  1 Peter 5:12 ). </li><li> Gifts freely bestowed by God; as miracles, prophecy, tongues ( Romans 15:15 ;  1 Corinthians 15:10 ;  Ephesians 3:8 ). </li><li> Christian virtues ( 2 Corinthians 8:7 ;  2 Pet  3:18 ). </li><li> The glory hereafter to be revealed ( 1 Peter 1:13 ).   </li>
Grace, means of	<p>an expression not used in Scripture, but employed (1) to denote those institutions ordained by God to be the ordinary channels of grace to the souls of men. These are the Word, Sacraments, and Prayer.  </p><li> But in popular language the expression is used in a wider sense to denote those exercises in which we engage for the purpose of obtaining spiritual blessing; as hearing the gospel, reading the Word, meditation, self-examination, Christian conversation, etc.   </li>
Graft	<p>the process of inoculating fruit-trees ( Romans 11:17-24 ). It is peculiarly appropriate to olive-trees. The union thus of branches to a stem is used to illustrate the union of true believers to the true Church.  </p>
Grain	<p>used, in  Amos 9:9 , of a small stone or kernel; in  Matthew 13:31 , of an individual seed of mustard; in John  John 15:37 , of wheat. The Hebrews sowed only wheat, barley, and spelt; rye and oats are not mentioned in Scripture.  </p>
Grape	<p>the fruit of the vine, which was extensively cultivated in Palestine. Grapes are spoken of as "tender" (Cant  John 2:13 John 2:15 ), "unripe" ( Job 15:33 ), "sour" ( Isaiah 18:5 ), "wild" ( Isaiah 5:2 Isaiah 5:4 ). (See   Revelation 14:18 ;  Micah 7:1 ;  Jeremiah 6:9 ;  Ezekiel 18:2 , for figurative use of the word.) (SeeVINE .) </p>
Grass	<p></p><li> Heb. hatsir, ripe grass fit for mowing ( 1 Kings 18:5 ;  Job 40:15 ;  Psalms 104:14 ). As the herbage rapidly fades under the scorching sun, it is used as an image of the brevity of human life ( Isaiah 40:6 Isaiah 40:7 ;  Psalms 90:5 ). In  Numbers 11:5  this word is rendered "leeks."  </li><li> Heb. deshe', green grass ( Genesis 1:11 Genesis 1:12 ;  Isaiah 66:14 ;  Deuteronomy 32:2 ). "The sickly and forced blades of grass which spring up on the flat plastered roofs of houses in the East are used as an emblem of speedy destruction, because they are small and weak, and because, under the scorching rays of the sun, they soon wither away" ( 2 Kings 19:26 ;  Psalms 129:6 ;  Isaiah 37:27 ).  <p> The dry stalks of grass were often used as fuel for the oven ( Matthew 6:30 ;  13:30 ;  Luke 12:28 ).  </p> </li>
Grasshopper	<p>belongs to the class of neuropterous insects called Gryllidae. This insect is not unknown in Palestine. </p><p> In  Judges 6:5 ;  7:12 ;  Job 39:30 ;  Jeremiah 46:23 , where the Authorized Version has "grasshopper," the Revised Version more correctly renders the Hebrew word ('arbeh) by "locust." This is the case also in  Amos 7:1 ;  Nahum 3:17 , where the Hebrew word <i> gob</i> is used; and in  Leviticus 11:22 ;  Numbers 13:33 ; Eccl  12:5 ;  Isaiah 40:22 , where <i> hagab</i> is used. In all these instances the proper rendering is probably "locust" (q.v.). </p>
Grate	<p>a network of brass for the bottom of the great altar of sacrifice ( Exodus 27:4 ;  35:16 ;  Exodus 38:4 Exodus 38:5 Exodus 38:30 ).  </p>
Grave	<p>Among the ancient Hebrews graves were outside of cities in the open field ( Luke 7:12 ;  John 11:30 ). Kings ( 1 Kings 2:10 ) and prophets ( 1 Samuel 25:1 ) were generally buried within cities. Graves were generally grottoes or caves, natural or hewn out in rocks ( Isaiah 22:16 ;  Matthew 27:60 ). There were family cemeteries ( Genesis 47:29 ;  50:5 ;  2 Sam  19:37 ). Public burial-places were assigned to the poor ( Jeremiah 26:23 ;  2 Kings  23:6 ). Graves were usually closed with stones, which were whitewashed, to warn strangers against contact with them ( Matthew 23:27 ), which caused ceremonial pollution ( Numbers 19:16 ).  </p><p> There were no graves in Jerusalem except those of the kings, and according to tradition that of the prophetess Huldah. </p>
Graven image	<p> Deuteronomy 27:15 ;  Psalms 97:7  (Heb. pesel), refers to the household gods of idolaters. "Every nation and city had its own gods...Yet every family had its separate household or tutelary god."  </p>
Graving	<p></p><li> Heb. hatsabh.  Job 19:24 , rendered "graven," but generally means hewn stone or wood, in quarry or forest.  </li><li> Heb. harush.  Jeremiah 17:1 , rendered "graven," and indicates generally artistic work in metal, wood, and stone, effected by fine instruments.  </li><li> Heb. haqaq.  Ezekiel 4:1 , engraving a plan or map, rendered "pourtray;"  Job 19:23 , "written."  </li><li> Heb. pasal points rather to the sculptor's or the carver's art ( Isaiah 30:22 ;  40:19 ;  41:7 ;  44:12-15 ).  </li><li> Pathah refers to intaglio work, the cutting and engraving of precious stones ( Exodus 28:9-11 Exodus 28:21 ;  Zechariah 3:9 ; Cant  Zechariah 1:10 Zechariah 1:11 ).  </li><li> Heret. In  Exodus 32:4  rendered "graving tool;" and in  Isaiah 8:1 , "a pen."   </li>
Greaves	<p>only in  1 Samuel 17:6 , a piece of defensive armour (q.v.) reaching from the foot to the knee; from French greve, "the shin." They were the Roman cothurni.  </p>
Grecians	<p>Hellenists, Greek-Jews; Jews born in a foreign country, and thus did not speak Hebrew ( Acts 6:1 ;  9:29 ), nor join in the Hebrew services of the Jews in Palestine, but had synagogues of their own in Jerusalem.  Joel 3:6  =Greeks.  </p>
Greece	<p>orginally consisted of the four provinces of Macedonia, Epirus, Achaia, and Peleponnesus. In  Acts 20:2  it designates only the Roman province of Macedonia. Greece was conquered by the Romans B.C. 146. After passing through various changes it was erected into an independent monarchy in 1831.  </p><p> Moses makes mention of Greece under the name of Javan ( Genesis 10:2-5 ); and this name does not again occur in the Old Testament till the time of ( Joel 3:6 ). Then the Greeks and Hebrews first came into contact in the Tyrian slave-market. Prophetic notice is taken of Greece in  Daniel 8:21 .  </p><p> The cities of Greece were the special scenes of the labours of the apostle Paul. </p>
Greek	<p>Found only in the New Testament, where a distinction is observed between "Greek" and "Grecian" (q.v.). The former is (1) a Greek by race ( Acts 16:1-3 ;  18:17 ;  Romans 1:14 ), or (2) a Gentile as opposed to a Jew ( Romans 2:9 Romans 2:10 ). The latter, meaning properly "one who speaks Greek," is a foreign Jew opposed to a home Jew who dwelt in Palestine.  </p><p> The word "Grecians" in  Acts 11:20  should be "Greeks," denoting the heathen Greeks of that city, as rendered in the Revised Version according to the reading of the best manuscripts ("Hellenes").  </p>
Greyhound	<p>( Proverbs 30:31 ), the rendering of the Hebrew <i> zarzir mothnayim</i> , meaning literally "girded as to the lions." Some (Gesen.; RSV marg.) render it "war-horse." The LXX. and Vulgate versions render it "cock." It has been by some interpreters rendered also "stag" and "warrior," as being girded about or panoplied, and "wrestler." The greyhound, however, was evidently known in ancient times, as appears from Egyptian monuments. </p>
Grind	<p>( Exodus 32:20 ;  Deuteronomy 9:21 ;  Judges 16:21 ), to crush small (Heb. tahan); to oppress the poor ( Isaiah 3:5 ). The hand-mill was early used by the Hebrews ( Numbers 11:8 ). It consisted of two stones, the upper ( Deuteronomy 24:6 ;  2 Sam  11:21 ) being movable and slightly concave, the lower being stationary. The grinders mentioned Eccl  12:3  are the teeth. (See MILL .) </p>
Grizzled	<p>party-coloured, as goats ( Genesis 31:10 Genesis 31:12 ), horses ( Zechariah 6:3 Zechariah 6:6 ).  </p>
Grove	<p></p><li> Heb. 'asherah, properly a wooden image, or a pillar representing Ashtoreth, a sensual Canaanitish goddess, probably usually set up in a grove ( 2 Kings 21:7 ;  23:4 ). In the Revised Version the word "Asherah" (q.v.) is introduced as a proper noun, the name of the wooden symbol of a goddess, with the plurals Asherim ( Exodus 34:13 ) and Asheroth ( Judges 3:13 ).  <p> The LXX. have rendered <i> asherah</i> in  2 Chronicles 15:16  by "Astarte." The Vulgate has done this also in  Judges 3:7 .  </p></li><li> Heb. 'eshel ( Genesis 21:33 ). In  1 Samuel 22:6  and  31:13  the Authorized Version renders this word by "tree." In all these passages the Revised Version renders by "tamarisk tree." It has been identified with the Tamariscus orientalis, five species of which are found in Palestine.  </li><li> The Heb. word 'elon, uniformly rendered in the Authorized Version by "plain," properly signifies a grove or plantation. In the Revised Version it is rendered, pl., "oaks" ( Genesis 13:18 ;  14:13 ;  18:1 ;  12:6 ;  Deuteronomy 11:30 ;  Joshua 19:33 ). In the earliest times groves are mentioned in connection with religious worship. The heathen consecrated groves to particular gods, and for this reason they were forbidden to the Jews ( Jeremiah 17:3 ;  Ezekiel 20:28 ).   </li>
Guard	<p></p><li> Heb. tabbah (properly a "cook," and in a secondary sense "executioner," because this office fell to the lot of the cook in Eastern countries), the bodyguard of the kings of Egypt ( Genesis 37:36 ) and Babylon ( 2 Kings 25:8 ;  Jeremiah 40:1 ;  Daniel 2:14 ).  </li><li> Heb. rats, properly a "courier," one whose office was to run before the king's chariot ( 2 Samuel 15:1 ;  1 Kings 1:5 ). The couriers were also military guards ( 1 Samuel 22:17 ;  2 Kings  10:25 ). They were probably the same who under David were called Pelethites ( 1 Kings 14:27 ;  2 Sam  15:1 ).  </li><li> Heb. mishmereth, one who watches ( Nehemiah 4:22 ), or a watch-station ( 7:3 ;  12:9 ;  Job 7:12 ).  <p> In the New Testament ( Mark 6:27 ) the Authorized Version renders the Greek <i> spekulator</i> by "executioner," earlier English versions by "hangman," the Revised Version by "soldier of his guard." The word properly means a "pikeman" or "halberdier," of whom the bodyguard of kings and princes was composed. In  Matthew 27:65 Matthew 27:66 ;  28:11 , the Authorized Version renders the Greek <i> kustodia</i> by "watch," and the Revised Version by "guard," the Roman guard, which consisted of four soldiers, who were relieved every three hours ( Acts 12:4 ). The "captain of the guard" mentioned  Acts 28:16  was the commander of the Praetorian troops, whose duty it was to receive and take charge of all prisoners from the provinces.  </p> </li>
Guest-chamber	<p>the spare room on the upper floor of an Eastern dwelling ( Mark 14:14 ;  Luke 22:11 ). In  Luke 2:7  the word is translated "inn" (q.v.).  </p>
Gur	<p>a whelp, a place near Ibleam where Jehu's servants overtook and mortally wounded king Ahaziah ( 2 Kings 9:27 ); an ascent from the plain of Jezreel.  </p>
Gur-baal	<p>sojourn of Baal, a place in Arabia ( 2 Chronicles 26:7 ) where there was probably a temple of Baal.  </p>
Gutter	<p>Heb. tsinnor, ( 2 Samuel 5:8 ). This Hebrew word occurs only elsewhere in  Psalms 42:7  in the plural, where it is rendered "waterspouts." It denotes some passage through which water passed; a water-course.  </p><p> In Gen 30:38,41the Hebrew word rendered "gutters" is <i> rahat</i> , and denotes vessels overflowing with water for cattle ( Exodus 2:16 ); drinking-troughs.  </p>
Hebrew of the Hebrews	<p>one whose parents are both Hebrews (Phil  3:5 ;  2 co  11:22 ); a genuine Hebrew.  </p>
Hebrews	<p>( Acts 6:1 ) were the Hebrew-speaking Jews, as distinguished from those who spoke Greek. (See GREEKS .) </p>
Hebrews, Epistle to	<p></p><li> Its canonicity. All the results of critical and historical research to which this epistle has been specially subjected abundantly vindicate its right to a place in the New Testament canon among the other inspired books.  </li><li> Its authorship. A considerable variety of opinions on this subject has at different times been advanced. Some have maintained that its author was Silas, Paul's companion. Others have attributed it to Clement of Rome, or Luke, or Barnabas, or some unknown Alexandrian Christian, or Apollos; but the conclusion which we think is best supported, both from internal and external evidence, is that Paul was its author. There are, no doubt, many difficulties in the way of accepting it as Paul's; but we may at least argue with Calvin that there can be no difficulty in the way of "embracing it without controversy as one of the apostolical epistles."  </li><li> Date and place of writing. It was in all probability written at Rome, near the close of Paul's two years' imprisonment ( Hebrews 13:19 Hebrews 13:24 ). It was certainly written before the destruction of Jerusalem ( 13:10 ).  </li><li> To whom addressed. Plainly it was intended for Jewish converts to the faith of the gospel, probably for the church at Jerusalem. The subscription of this epistle is, of course, without authority. In this case it is incorrect, for obviously Timothy could not be the bearer of it ( 13:23 ).  </li><li> Its design was to show the true end and meaning of the Mosaic system, and its symbolical and transient character. It proves that the Levitical priesthood was a "shadow" of that of Christ, and that the legal sacrifices prefigured the great and all-perfect sacrifice he offered for us. It explains that the gospel was designed, not to modify the law of Moses, but to supersede and abolish it. Its teaching was fitted, as it was designed, to check that tendency to apostatize from Christianity and to return to Judaism which now showed itself among certain Jewish Christians. The supreme authority and the transcendent glory of the gospel are clearly set forth, and in such a way as to strengthen and confirm their allegiance to Christ.  </li><li> It consists of two parts: (a) doctrinal ( (1-10:18), ), (b) and practical (10:19-ch. 13). There are found in it many references to portions of the Old Testament. It may be regarded as a treatise supplementary to the Epistles to the Romans and Galatians, and as an inspired commentary on the book of Leviticus.   </li>
Hebron	<p>a community; alliance. </p><li> A city in the south end of the valley of Eshcol, about midway between Jerusalem and Beersheba, from which it is distant about 20 miles in a straight line. It was built "seven years before Zoan in Egypt" ( Genesis 13:18 ;  Numbers 13:22 ). It still exists under the same name, and is one of the most ancient cities in the world. Its earlier name was Kirjath-arba ( Genesis 23:2 ;  Joshua 14:15 ;  15:3 ). But "Hebron would appear to have been the original name of the city, and it was not till after Abraham's stay there that it received the name Kirjath-arba, who [i.e., Arba] was not the founder but the conqueror of the city, having led thither the tribe of the Anakim, to which he belonged. It retained this name till it came into the possession of Caleb, when the Israelites restored the original name Hebron" (Keil, Com.). The name of this city does not occur in any of the prophets or in the New Testament. It is found about forty times in the Old. It was the favorite home of Abraham. Here he pitched his tent under the oaks of Mamre, by which name it came afterwards to be known; and here Sarah died, and was buried in the cave of Machpelah ( Genesis 23:17-20 ), which he bought from Ephron the Hittite. From this place the patriarch departed for Egypt by way of Beersheba ( 37:14 ;  46:1 ). It was taken by Joshua and given to Caleb ( Joshua 10:36 Joshua 10:37 ;  12:10 ;  14:13 ). It became a Levitical city and a city of refuge ( 20:7 ;  21:11 ). When David became king of Judah this was his royal residence, and he resided here for seven and a half years ( 2 Samuel 5:5 ); and here he was anointed as king over all Israel ( 2 Samuel 2:1-4 2 Samuel 2:11 ;  1 Kings 2:11 ). It became the residence also of the rebellious Absalom ( 2 Samuel 15:10 ), who probably expected to find his chief support in the tribe of Judah, now called el-Khulil.  <p> In one part of the modern city is a great mosque, which is built over the grave of Machpelah. The first European who was permitted to enter this mosque was the Prince of Wales in 1862. It was also visited by the Marquis of Bute in 1866, and by the late Emperor Frederick of Germany (then Crown-Prince of Prussia) in 1869.  </p><p> One of the largest oaks in Palestine is found in the valley of Eshcol, about 3 miles north of the town. It is supposed by some to be the tree under which Abraham pitched his tent, and is called "Abraham's oak." (See OAK .) </p></li><li> The third son of Kohath the Levite ( Exodus 6:18 ;  1 Chronicles 6:2 1 Chronicles 6:18 ).  </li><li> 1 Chronicles 2:42 1 Chronicles 2:43 .  </li><li> A town in the north border of Asher ( Joshua 19:28 ).   </li>
Hegai	<p>eunuch, had charge of the harem of Ahasuerus ( Esther 2:8 ).  </p>
Heifer	<p>Heb. 'eglah, ( Deuteronomy 21:4 Deuteronomy 21:6 ;  Jeremiah 46:20 ). Untrained to the yoke ( Hosea 10:11 ); giving milk ( Isaiah 7:21 ); ploughing ( Judges 14:18 ); treading out grain ( Jeremiah 50:11 ); unsubdued to the yoke an emblem of Judah ( Isaiah 15:5 ;  Jeremiah 48:34 ).  </p><p> Heb. parah ( Genesis 41:2 ;  Numbers 19:2 ). Bearing the yoke ( Hosea 4:16 ); "heifers of Bashan" ( Amos 4:1 ), metaphorical for the voluptuous females of Samaria. The ordinance of sacrifice of the "red heifer" described in  Numbers 19:1-10 ; Compare  Hebrews 9:13 .  </p>
Heir	<p>Under the patriarchs the property of a father was divided among the sons of his legitimate wives ( Genesis 21:10 ;  24:36 ;  25:5 ), the eldest son getting a larger portion than the rest. The Mosaic law made specific regulations regarding the transmission of real property, which are given in detail in  Deuteronomy 21:17 ;  Numbers 27:8 ;  36:6 ;  27:9-11 . Succession to property was a matter of right and not of favour. Christ is the "heir of all things" ( Hebrews 1:2 ;  Colossians 1:15 ). Believers are heirs of the "promise," "of righteousness," "of the kingdom," "of the world," "of God," "joint heirs" with Christ ( Galatians 3:29 ;  Hebrews 6:17 ;  11:7 ;  James 2:5 ;  Romans 4:13 ;  8:17 ).  </p>
Helah	<p>rust, ( 1 Chronicles 4:5 1 Chronicles 4:7 ), one of the wives of Ashur.  </p>
Helam	<p>place of abundance, a place on the east of Jordan and west of the Euphrates where David gained a great victory over the Syrian army ( 2 Samuel 10:16 ), which was under the command of Shobach. Some would identify it with Alamatta, near Nicephorium.  </p>
Helbah	<p>fatness, a town of the tribe of Asher ( Judges 1:31 ), in the plain of Phoenicia.  </p>
Helbon	<p>fat; i.e., "fertile", ( Ezekiel 27: :  18  only), a place whence wine was brought to the great market of Tyre. It has been usually identified with the modern Aleppo, called Haleb by the native Arabs, but is more probably to be found in one of the villages in the Wady Helbon, which is celebrated for its grapes, on the east slope of Anti-Lebanon, north of the river Barada (Abana).  </p>
Heldai	<p>wordly. </p><li> 1 Chronicles 27:15 ; called also Heleb ( 2 Samuel 23:29 ); one of David's captains.  </li><li> Zechariah 6:10 , one who returned from Babylon.   </li>
Heleb	<p>fatness, one of David's warriors ( 2 Samuel 23:29 ).  </p>

Helem	<p>a stroke, great-grandson of Asher ( 1 Chronicles 7:35 ).  </p>

Helez	<p>strong, or loin (?) </p><li> One of Judah's posterity ( 1 Chronicles 2:39 ).  </li><li> One of David's warriors ( 2 Samuel 23:26 ).   </li>
Heli	<p>elevation, father of Joseph in the line of our Lord's ancestry ( Luke 3:23 ).  </p>
Helkai	<p>smooth-tongued, one of the chief priests in the time of Joiakim ( Nehemiah 12:15 ).  </p>
Helkath	<p>smoothness, a town of Asher, on the east border ( Joshua 19:25 ;  21:31 ); called also Hukok ( 1 Chronicles 6:75 ).  </p>
Helkath-hazzurim	<p>plot of the sharp blades, or the field of heroes, ( 2 Samuel 2:16 ). After the battle of Gilboa, so fatal to Saul and his house, David, as divinely directed, took up his residence in Hebron, and was there anointed king over Judah. Among the fugitives from Gilboa was Ish-bosheth, the only surviving son of Saul, whom Abner, Saul's uncle, took across the Jordan to Mahanaim, and there had him proclaimed king. Abner gathered all the forces at his command and marched to Gibeon, with the object of wresting Judah from David. Joab had the command of David's army of trained men, who encamped on the south of the pool, which was on the east of the hill on which the town of Gibeon was built, while Abner's army lay on the north of the pool. Abner proposed that the conflict should be decided by twelve young men engaging in personal combat on either side. So fiercely did they encounter each other that "they caught every man his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim." The combat of the champions was thus indecisive, and there followed a severe general engagement between the two armies, ending in the total rout of the Israelites under Abner. The general result of this battle was that "David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker" ( 2 Samuel 3:1 ). (See GIBEON .) </p>
Hell	<p>derived from the Saxon helan, to cover; hence the covered or the invisible place. In Scripture there are three words so rendered: </p><li> Sheol, occurring in the Old Testament sixty-five times. This word sheol is derived from a root-word meaning "to ask," "demand;" hence insatiableness ( Proverbs 30:15 Proverbs 30:16 ). It is rendered "grave" thirty-one times ( Genesis 37:35 ;  42:38 ;  Genesis 44:29 Genesis 44:31 ;  1 Samuel 2:6 , etc.). The Revisers have retained this rendering in the historical books with the original word in the margin, while in the poetical books they have reversed this rule.  <p> In thirty-one cases in the Authorized Version this word is rendered "hell," the place of disembodied spirits. The inhabitants of sheol are "the congregation of the dead" ( Proverbs 21:16 ). It is (a) the abode of the wicked ( Numbers 16:33 ;  Job 24:19 ;  Psalms 9:17 ;  31:17 , etc.); (b) of the good ( Psalms 16:10 ;  30:3 ;  49:15 ;  86:13 , etc.).  </p><p> Sheol is described as deep ( Job 11:8 ), dark ( Job 10:21 Job 10:22 ), with bars ( 17:16 ). The dead "go down" to it ( Numbers 16:30 Numbers 16:33 ; Ezek.  Numbers 31:15 Numbers 31:16 Numbers 31:17 ).  </p></li><li> The Greek word hades of the New Testament has the same scope of signification as sheol of the Old Testament. It is a prison ( 1 Peter 3:19 ), with gates and bars and locks ( Matthew 16:18 ;  Revelation 1:18 ), and it is downward ( Matthew 11:23 ;  Luke 10:15 ).  <p> The righteous and the wicked are separated. The blessed dead are in that part of hades called paradise ( Luke 23:43 ). They are also said to be in Abraham's bosom ( Luke 16:22 ).  </p></li><li> Gehenna, in most of its occurrences in the Greek New Testament, designates the place of the lost ( Matthew 23:33 ). The fearful nature of their condition there is described in various figurative expressions ( Matthew 8:12 ;  13:42 ;  22:13 ;  25:30 ;  Luke 16:24 , etc.). (See HINNOM .)  </li>
Helmet	<p>(Heb. kob'a), a cap for the defence of the head ( 1 Samuel 17:5 1 Samuel 17:38 ). In the New Testament the Greek equivalent is used ( Ephesians 6:17 ;  1 Thessalonians 5:8 ). (See ARMS .) </p>
Helon	<p>strong, father of Eliab, who was "captain of the children of Zebulun" ( Numbers 1:9 ;  2:7 ).  </p>
Help-meet	<p>(Heb. 'ezer ke-negdo; i.e., "a help as his counterpart" = a help suitable to him), a wife ( Genesis 2:18-20 ).  </p>
Helps	<p>( 1 Corinthians 12:28 ) may refer to help (i.e., by interpretation) given to him who speaks with tongues, or more probably simply help which Christians can render to one another, such as caring for the poor and needy, etc.  </p>
Hem	<p>of a garment, the fringe of a garment. The Jews attached much importance to these, because of the regulations in  Numbers 15:38 Numbers 15:39 . These borders or fringes were in process of time enlarged so as to attract special notice ( Matthew 23:5 ). The hem of Christ's garment touched ( 9:20 ;  14:36 ;  Luke 8:44 ).  </p>
Heman	<p>faithful. </p><li> 1 Kings 4:31 ;  1 Chronicles 2:6 , a son of Zerah, noted for his wisdom. </li><li> Grandson of Samuel ( 1 Chronicles 6:33 ;  15:17 ), to whom the 88th Psalm probably was inscribed. He was one of the "seers" named in  2 Chronicles 29:14 2 Chronicles 29:30 , and took a leading part in the administration of the sacred services.   </li>
Hemath	<p>a Kenite ( 1 Chronicles 2:55 ), the father of the house of Rechab.  </p>
Hemlock	<p></p><li> Heb. rosh ( Hosea 10:4 ; rendered "gall" in  Deuteronomy 29:18 ;  32:32 ;  Psalms 69:21 ;  Jeremiah 9:15 ;  23:15 ; "poison,"  Job 20:16 ; "venom,"  Deuteronomy 32:33 ). "Rosh is the name of some poisonous plant which grows quickly and luxuriantly; of a bitter taste, and therefore coupled with wormwood ( Deuteronomy 29:18 ;  Lamentations 3:19 ). Hence it would seem to be not the hemlock cicuta, nor the colocynth or wild gourd, nor lolium darnel, but the poppy so called from its heads" (Gesenius, Lex.).  </li><li> Heb. la'anah, generally rendered "wormwood" (q.v.),  Deuteronomy 29:18 , Text 17;  Proverbs 5:4 ;  Jeremiah 9:15 ;  23:15 . Once it is rendered "hemlock" ( Amos 6:12 ; RSV, "wormwood"). This Hebrew word is from a root meaning "to curse," hence the accursed.   </li>
Hen	<p>common in later times among the Jews in Palestine ( Matthew 23:37 ;  Luke 13:34 ). It is noticeable that this familiar bird is only mentioned in these passages in connection with our Lord's lamentation over the impenitence of Jerusalem.  </p>
Hena	<p>one of the cities of Mesopotamia destroyed by sennacherib ( 2 Kings 18:34 ;  19:13 ). It is identified with the modern Anah, lying on the right bank of the Euphrates, not far from Sepharvaim.  </p>
Henadad	<p>favour of Hadad, the name of a Levite after the Captivity ( Ezra 3:9 ).  </p>
Henoch	<p>See ENOCH . </p>
Hepher	<p>a well or stream. </p><li> A royal city of the Canaanites taken by ( Joshua 12:17 ).  </li><li> The youngest son of Gilead ( Numbers 26:32 ;  27:1 ).  </li><li> The second son of Asher ( 1 Chronicles 4:6 ).  </li><li> One of David's heroes ( 1 Chronicles 11:36 ).   </li>
Hephzibah	<p>my delight is in her. </p><li> The wife of Hezekiah and mother of king Manasseh ( 2 Kings 21:1 ).  </li><li> A symbolical name of Zion, as representing the Lord's favour toward her ( Isaiah 62:4 ).   </li>
Herb	<p></p><li> Heb. 'eseb, any green plant; herbage ( Genesis 1:11 Genesis 1:12 Genesis 1:29 Genesis 1:30 ;  2:5 ;  3:18 , etc.); comprehending vegetables and all green herbage ( Amos 7:1 Amos 7:2 ).  </li><li> <i> Yarak</i> , green; any green thing; foliage of trees ( 2 Kings 19:26 ;  Psalms 37:2 ); a plant; herb ( Deuteronomy 11:10 ).  </li><li> <i> Or</i> , meaning "light" In  Isaiah 26:19  it means "green herbs;" in  2 Kings 4:39  probably the fruit of some plant.  </li><li> <i> Merorim</i> , plural, "bitter herbs," eaten by the Israelites at the Passover ( Exodus 12:8 ;  Numbers 9:11 ). They were bitter plants of various sorts, and referred symbolically to the oppression in Egypt.   </li>
Herd	<p> Genesis 13:5 ;  Deuteronomy 7:14 . (See CATTLE .) </p>
Herdsman	<p>In Egypt herdsmen were probably of the lowest caste. Some of Joseph's brethren were made rulers over Pharaoh's cattle ( Genesis 47:6 Genesis 47:17 ). The Israelites were known in Egypt as "keepers of cattle;" and when they left it they took their flocks and herds with them ( Exodus 12:38 ). Both David and Saul came from "following the herd" to occupy the throne ( 1 Samuel 9 ;  11:5 ;  Psalms 78:70 ). David's herd-masters were among his chief officers of state. The daughters also of wealthy chiefs were wont to tend the flocks of the family ( Genesis 29:9 ;  Exodus 2:16 ). The "chief of the herdsmen" was in the time of the monarchy an officer of high rank ( 1 Samuel 21:7 ; Compare  1 Chronicles 27:29 ). The herdsmen lived in tents ( Isaiah 38:12 ;  Jeremiah 6:3 ); and there were folds for the cattle ( Numbers 32:16 ), and watch-towers for the herdsmen, that he might therefrom observe any coming danger ( Micah 4:8 ;  Nahum 3:8 ).  </p>
Heres	<p>sun. </p><li> "Mount Heres" ( Judges 1:35 ), Heb. Har-heres, i.e., "sun-mountain;" probably identical with Irshemesh in  Joshua 19:41 .  </li><li> Isaiah 19:18 , marg. (See ON .)  </li>
Heresy	<p>from a Greek word signifying (1) a choice, (2) the opinion chosen, and (3) the sect holding the opinion. In the Acts of the Apostles ( 5:17 ;  15:5 ;  Isaiah 24:5 Isaiah 24:14 ;  26:5 ) it denotes a sect, without reference to its character. Elsewhere, however, in the New Testament it has a different meaning attached to it. Paul ranks "heresies" with crimes and seditions ( Galatians 5:20 ). This word also denotes divisions or schisms in the church ( 1 Corinthians 11:19 ). In  Titus 3:10  a "heretical person" is one who follows his own self-willed "questions," and who is to be avoided. Heresies thus came to signify self-chosen doctrines not emanating from God ( 2 Peter 2:1 ).  </p>
Hermas	<p>Mercury, a Roman Christian to whom Paul sends greetings ( Romans 16: :  14 ). Some suppose him to have been the author of the celebrated religious romance called The Shepherd, but it is very probable that that work is the production of a later generation.  </p>
Hermes	<p>Mercury, a Roman Christian ( Romans 16:14 ).  </p>
Hermogenes	<p>Mercury-born, at one time Paul's fellow-labourer in Asia Minor, who, however, afterwards abandoned him, along with one Phygellus, probably on account of the perils by which they were beset ( 2 Timothy 1:15 ).  </p>
Hermon	<p>a peak, the eastern prolongation of the Anti-Lebanon range, reaching to the height of about 9,200 feet above the Mediterranean. It marks the north boundary of Palestine ( Deuteronomy 3:8 Deuteronomy 4:48 ;  Joshua 11:3 Joshua 11:17 ;  13:11 ;  12:1 ), and is seen from a great distance. It is about 40 miles north of the Sea of Galilee. It is called "the Hermonites" ( Psalms 42:6 ) because it has more than one summit. The Sidonians called it Sirion, and the Amorites Shenir ( Deuteronomy 3:9 ; Cant  4:8 ). It is also called Baal-hermon ( Judges 3:3 ;  1 Chronicles 5:23 ) and Sion ( Deuteronomy 4:48 ). There is every probability that one of its three summits was the scene of the transfiguration (q.v.). The "dew of Hermon" is referred to ( Psalms 89: :  12 ). Its modern name is Jebel-esh-Sheikh, "the chief mountain." It is one of the most conspicuous mountains in Palestine or Syria. "In whatever part of Palestine the Israelite turned his eye northward, Hermon was there, terminating the view. From the plain along the coast, from the Jordan valley, from the heights of Moab and Gilead, from the plateau of Bashan, the pale, blue, snow-capped cone forms the one feature in the northern horizon."  </p><p> Our Lord and his disciples climbed this "high mountain apart" one day, and remained on its summit all night, "weary after their long and toilsome ascent." During the night "he was transfigured before them; and his face did shine as the sun." The next day they descended to Caesarea Philippi. </p>
Hermonites, the	<p>( Psalms 42:6 Psalms 42:7 ) = "the Hermons", i.e., the three peaks or summits of Hermon, which are about a quarter of a mile apart.  </p>
Herod Agrippa I.	<p>son of Aristobulus and Bernice, and grandson of Herod the Great. He was made tetrarch of the provinces formerly held by Lysanias II., and ultimately possessed the entire kingdom of his grandfather, Herod the Great, with the title of king. He put the apostle James the elder to death, and cast Peter into prison ( Luke 3:1 ;  Acts 12:1-19 ). On the second day of a festival held in honour of the emperor Claudius, he appeared in the great theatre of Caesarea. "The king came in clothed in magnificent robes, of which silver was the costly brilliant material. It was early in the day, and the sun's rays fell on the king, so that the eyes of the beholders were dazzled with the brightness which surrounded him. Voices here and there from the crowd exclaimed that it was the apparition of something divine. And when he spoke and made an oration to them, they gave a shout, saying, 'It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.' But in the midst of this idolatrous ostentation an angel of God suddenly smote him. He was carried out of the theatre a dying man." He died (A.D. 44) of the same loathsome malady which slew his grandfather ( Acts 12:21-23 ), in the fifty-fourth year of his age, having reigned four years as tetrarch and three as king over the whole of Palestine. After his death his kingdom came under the control of the prefect of Syria, and Palestine was now fully incorporated with the empire.  </p>
Herod Antipas	<p>Herod's son by Malthace ( Matthew 14:1 ;  Luke 3:1 Luke 3:19 ;  9:7 ;  Acts 13:1 ). (See ANTIPAS .) </p>
Herod Archelaus	<p>( Matthew 2:22 ), the brother of Antipas (q.v.).  </p>
Herod Arippa II.	<p>the son of Herod Agrippa I. and Cypros. The emperor Claudius made him tetrarch of the provinces of Philip and Lysanias, with the title of king ( Acts 25:13 ;  Acts 26:2 Acts 26:7 ). He enlarged the city of Caesarea Philippi, and called it Neronias, in honour of Nero. It was before him and his sister that Paul made his defence at Caesarea ( Acts 25:12-27 ). He died at Rome A.D. 100, in the third year of the emperor Trajan.  </p>
Herod Philip I.	<p>( Mark 6:17 ), the son of Herod the Great by Mariamne, the daughter of Simon, the high priest. He is distinguished from another Philip called "the tetrarch." He lived at Rome as a private person with his wife Herodias and his daughter Salome.  </p>
Herod Philip II.	<p>the son of Herod the Great and Cleopatra of Jerusalem. He was "tetrarch" of Batanea, Iturea, Trachonitis, and Auranitis. He rebuilt the city of Caesarea Philippi, calling it by his own name to distinguish it from the Caesarea on the sea-coast which was the seat of the Roman government. He married Salome, the daughter of Herodias ( Matthew 16:13 ;  Mark 8:27 ;  Luke 3:1 ).  </p>
Herod the Great	<p>( Matthew 2:1-22 ;  Luke 1:5 ;  Acts 23:35 ), the son of Antipater, an Idumaean, and Cypros, an Arabian of noble descent. In the year B.C. 47 Julius Caesar made Antipater, a "wily Idumaean," procurator of Judea, who divided his territories between his four sons, Galilee falling to the lot of Herod, who was afterwards appointed tetrarch of Judea by Mark Antony (B.C. 40), and also king of Judea by the Roman senate.  </p><p> He was of a stern and cruel disposition. "He was brutish and a stranger to all humanity." Alarmed by the tidings of one "born King of the Jews," he sent forth and "slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under" ( Matthew 2:16 ). He was fond of splendour, and lavished great sums in rebuilding and adorning the cities of his empire. He rebuilt the city of Caesarea (q.v.) on the coast, and also the city of Samaria (q.v.), which he called Sebaste, in honour of Augustus. He restored the ruined temple of Jerusalem, a work which was begun B.C. 20, but was not finished till after Herod's death, probably not till about A.D. 50 ( John 2:20 ). After a troubled reign of thirty-seven years, he died at Jericho amid great agonies both of body and mind, B.C. 4, i.e., according to the common chronology, in the year in which Jesus was born.  </p><p> After his death his kingdom was divided among three of his sons. Of these, Philip had the land east of Jordan, between Caesarea Philippi and Bethabara, Antipas had Galilee and Peraea, while Archelaus had Judea and Samaria. </p>
Herodians	<p>a Jewish political party who sympathized with ( Mark 3:6 ;  12:13 ; Matt,  22:16 ;  Luke 20:20 ) the Herodian rulers in their general policy of government, and in the social customs which they introduced from Rome. They were at one with the Sadducees in holding the duty of submission to Rome, and of supporting the Herods on the throne. (Compare  Mark 8:15 ;  Matthew 16:6 .)  </p>
Herodias	<p>( Matthew 14:3-11 ;  Mark 6:17-28 ;  Luke 3:19 ), the daughter of Aristobulus and Bernice. While residing at Rome with her husband Herod Philip I. and her daughter, Herod Antipas fell in with her during one of his journeys to that city. She consented to leave her husband and become his wife. Some time after, Herod met John the Baptist, who boldly declared the marriage to be unlawful. For this he was "cast into prison," in the castle probably of Machaerus (q.v.), and was there subsequently beheaded.  </p>
Herodion	<p>a Christian at Rome whom Paul salutes and calls his "kinsman" ( Romans 16:11 ).  </p>
Heron	<p>( Leviticus 11:19 ;  Deuteronomy 14:18 ), ranked among the unclean birds. The Hebrew name is <i> 'anaphah</i> , and indicates that the bird so named is remarkable for its angry disposition. "The herons are wading-birds, peculiarly irritable, remarkable for their voracity, frequenting marshes and oozy rivers, and spread over the regions of the East." The Ardea russeta, or little golden egret, is the commonest species in Asia. </p>
Heshbon	<p>intelligence, a city ruled over by Sihon, king of the Amorites ( Joshua 3:10 ;  13:17 ). It was taken by Moses ( Numbers 21:23-26 ), and became afterwards a Levitical city ( Joshua 21:39 ) in the tribe of Reuben ( Numbers 32:37 ). After the Exile it was taken possession of by the Moabites ( Isaiah 15:4 ;  Jeremiah 48:2 Jeremiah 48:34 Jeremiah 48:45 ). The ruins of this town are still seen about 20 miles east of Jordan from the north end of the Dead Sea. There are reservoirs in this district, which are probably the "fishpools" referred to in Cant  7:4 .  </p>
Heshmon	<p>fatness, a town in the south of Judah ( Joshua 15:27 ).  </p>
Heth	<p>dread, a descendant of Canaan, and the ancestor of the Hittites ( Genesis 10:18 ;  Deuteronomy 7:1 ), who dwelt in the vicinity of Hebron ( Genesis 23:3 Genesis 23:7 ). The Hittites were a Hamitic race. They are called "the sons of Heth" ( Genesis 23:3 Genesis 23:5 Genesis 23:7 Genesis 23:10 Genesis 23:16 Genesis 23:18 Genesis 23:20 ).  </p>
Hethlon	<p>wrapped up, a place on the north border of Palestine. The "way of Hethlon" ( Ezekiel 47:15 ;  48:1 ) is probably the pass at the end of Lebanon from the Mediterranean to the great plain of Hamath (q.v.), or the "entrance of Hamath."  </p>
Hezekiah	<p>whom Jehovah has strengthened. </p><li> Son of Ahaz ( 2 Kings 18:1 ;  2 Chr  29:1 ), whom he succeeded on the throne of the kingdom of Judah. He reigned twenty-nine years (B.C. 726-697). The history of this king is contained in  2 Kings 18:20 ,  Isaiah 3639 -39, and  2 Chronicles 2932 -32. He is spoken of as a great and good king. In public life he followed the example of his great-granfather Uzziah. He set himself to abolish idolatry from his kingdom, and among other things which he did for this end, he destroyed the "brazen serpent," which had been removed to Jerusalem, and had become an object of idolatrous worship ( Numbers 21:9 ). A great reformation was wrought in the kingdom of Judah in his day ( 2 Kings 18:4 ;  2 Chr  29:3-36 ).  <p> On the death of Sargon and the accession of his son Sennacherib to the throne of Assyria, Hezekiah refused to pay the tribute which his father had paid, and "rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not," but entered into a league with Egypt ( Isaiah 30 ;  31 ;  36:6-9 ). This led to the invasion of Judah by Sennacherib ( 2 Kings 18:13-16 ), who took forty cities, and besieged Jerusalem with mounds. Hezekiah yielded to the demands of the Assyrian king, and agreed to pay him three hundred talents of silver and thirty of gold ( 18:14 ).  </p><p> But Sennacherib dealt treacherously with Hezekiah ( Isaiah 33:1 ), and a second time within two years invaded his kingdom ( 2 Kings 18:17 ;  2 Chr  32:9 ;  Isaiah 36 ). This invasion issued in the destruction of Sennacherib's army. Hezekiah prayed to God, and "that night the angel of the Lord went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians 185,000 men." Sennacherib fled with the shattered remnant of his forces to Nineveh, where, seventeen years after, he was assassinated by his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer ( 2 Kings 19:37 ). (See SENNACHERIB .) </p><p> The narrative of Hezekiah's sickness and miraculous recovery is found in 2Kings 20:1,  2 Chronicles 32:24 ,  Isaiah 38:1 . Various ambassadors came to congratulate him on his recovery, and among them Merodach-baladan, the viceroy of Babylon ( 2 Chronicles 32:23 ;  2 Kings  20:12 ). He closed his days in peace and prosperity, and was succeeded by his son Manasseh. He was buried in the "chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David" ( 2 Chronicles 32:27-33 ). He had "after him none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him" ( 2 Kings 18:5 ). (See ISAIAH .) </p> </li>
Hezion	<p>vision, the father of Tabrimon, and grandfather of Ben-hadad, king of Syria ( 1 Kings 15:18 ).  </p>
Hezir	<p>swine or strong. </p><li> The head of the seventeenth course of the priests ( 1 Chronicles 24:15 ). </li><li> Nehemiah 10:20 , one who sealed Nehemiah's covenant.   </li>
Hezro	<p>a Carmelite, one of David's warriors ( 1 Chronicles 11:37 ).  </p>
Hezron	<p>enclosed. </p><li> One of the sons of Reuben ( Genesis 46:9 ;  Exodus 6:14 ). </li><li> The older of the two sons of Pharez ( Genesis 46:12 ). </li><li> A plain in the south of Judah, west of Kadesh-barnea ( Joshua 15:3 ).   </li>
Hiddai	<p>rejoicing of Jehovah, one of David's thirty-seven guards ( 2 Samuel 23:30 ).  </p>
Hiddekel	<p>called by the Accadians id Idikla; i.e., "the river of Idikla", the third of the four rivers of Paradise ( Genesis 2:14 ). Gesenius interprets the word as meaning "the rapid Tigris." The Tigris rises in the mountains of Armenia, 15 miles south of the source of the Euphrates, which, after pursuing a south-east course, it joins at Kurnah, about 50 miles above Bassorah. Its whole length is about 1,150 miles.  </p>
Hiel	<p>life of (i.e., from) God, a native of Bethel, who built (i.e., fortified) Jericho some seven hundred years after its destruction by the Israelites. There fell on him for such an act the imprecation of ( Joshua 6:26 ). He laid the foundation in his first-born, and set up the gates in his youngest son ( 1 Kings 16:34 ), i.e., during the progress of the work all his children died.  </p>
Hierapolis	<p>sacred city, a city of Phrygia, where was a Christian church under the care of Epaphras ( Colossians 4:12 Colossians 4:13 ). This church was founded at the same time as that of Colosse. It now bears the name of Pambuk-Kalek, i.e., "Cotton Castle", from the white appearance of the cliffs at the base of which the ruins are found.  </p>
Higgaion	<p>in  Psalms 92:3  means the murmuring tone of the harp. In  Psalms 9:16  it is a musical sign, denoting probably a pause in the instrumental interlude. In  Psalms 19:14  the word is rendered "meditation;" and in  Lamentations 3:62 , "device" (RSV, "imagination").  </p>
High place	<p>an eminence, natural or artificial, where worship by sacrifice or offerings was made ( 1 Kings 13:32 ;  2 Kings  17:29 ). The first altar after the Flood was built on a mountain ( Genesis 8:20 ). Abraham also built an altar on a mountain ( Genesis 12:7 Genesis 12:8 ). It was on a mountain in Gilead that Laban and Jacob offered sacrifices ( 31:54 ). After the Israelites entered the Promised Land they were strictly enjoined to overthrow the high places of the Canaanites ( Exodus 34:13 ;  Deuteronomy 7:5 ;  Deuteronomy 12:2 Deuteronomy 12:3 ), and they were forbidden to worship the Lord on high places ( Deuteronomy 12:11-14 ), and were enjoined to use but one altar for sacrifices ( Leviticus 17:3 Leviticus 17:4 ;  Deuteronomy 12 ;  16:21 ). The injunction against high places was, however, very imperfectly obeyed, and we find again and again mention made of them ( 2 Kings 14:4 ; ( 2 Kings 15:17 , etc.).  </p>
High priest	<p>Aaron was the first who was solemnly set apart to this office ( Exodus 29:7 ;  30:23 ;  Leviticus 8:12 ). He wore a peculiar dress, which on his death passed to his successor in office ( Exodus 29:29 Exodus 29:30 ). Besides those garments which he wore in common with all priests, there were four that were peculiar to himself as high priest:  </p><li> The "robe" of the ephod, all of blue, of "woven work," worn immediately under the ephod. It was without seam or sleeves. The hem or skirt was ornamented with pomegranates and golden bells, seventy-two of each in alternate order. The sounding of the bells intimated to the people in the outer court the time when the high priest entered into the holy place to burn incense before the Lord ( Exodus 28 ).  </li><li> The "ephod" consisted of two parts, one of which covered the back and the other the breast, which were united by the "curious girdle." It was made of fine twined linen, and ornamented with gold and purple. Each of the shoulder-straps was adorned with a precious stone, on which the names of the twelve tribes were engraved. This was the high priest's distinctive vestment ( 1 Samuel 2:28 ;  14:3 ;  21:9 ;  1 Samuel 23:6 1 Samuel 23:9 ;  30:7 ).  </li><li> The "breastplate of judgment" ( Exodus 28:6-12 Exodus 28:25-28 ;  39:2-7 ) of "cunning work." It was a piece of cloth doubled, of one span square. It bore twelve precious stones, set in four rows of three in a row, which constituted the Urim and Thummim (q.v.). These stones had the names of the twelve tribes engraved on them. When the high priest, clothed with the ephod and the breastplate, inquired of the Lord, answers were given in some mysterious way by the Urim and Thummim ( 1 Samuel 14:3 1 Samuel 14:18 1 Samuel 14:19 ;  1 Samuel 23:2 1 Samuel 23:4 1 Samuel 23:9 1 Samuel 23:11 1 Samuel 23:12 ;  28:6 ;  2 Sam  <span class="badLink">5:23</span> ).  </li><li> The "mitre," or upper turban, a twisted band of eight yards of fine linen coiled into a cap, with a gold plate in front, engraved with "Holiness to the Lord," fastened to it by a ribbon of blue.  <p> To the high priest alone it was permitted to enter the holy of holies, which he did only once a year, on the great Day of Atonement, for "the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest" ( Hebrews 9 ;  10 ). Wearing his gorgeous priestly vestments, he entered the temple before all the people, and then, laying them aside and assuming only his linen garments in secret, he entered the holy of holies alone, and made expiation, sprinkling the blood of the sin offering on the mercy seat, and offering up incense. Then resuming his splendid robes, he reappeared before the people ( Leviticus 16 ). Thus the wearing of these robes came to be identified with the Day of Atonement.  </p><p> The office, dress, and ministration of the high priest were typical of the priesthood of our Lord ( Hebrews 4:14 ;  7:25 ;  9:12 , etc.).  </p><p> It is supposed that there were in all eighty-three high priests, beginning with Aaron (B.C. 1657) and ending with Phannias (A.D. 70). At its first institution the office of high priest was held for life (but Compare  1 Kings 2:27 ), and was hereditary in the family of Aaron ( Numbers 3:10 ). The office continued in the line of Eleazar, Aaron's eldest son, for two hundred and ninety-six years, when it passed to Eli, the first of the line of Ithamar, who was the fourth son of Aaron. In this line it continued to Abiathar, whom Solomon deposed, and appointed Zadok, of the family of Eleazar, in his stead ( 1 Kings 2:35 ), in which it remained till the time of the Captivity. After the Return, Joshua, the son of Josedek, of the family of Eleazar, was appointed to this office. After him the succession was changed from time to time under priestly or political influences.  </p> </li>
Highway	<p>a raised road for public use. Such roads were not found in Palestine; hence the force of the language used to describe the return of the captives and the advent of the Messiah ( Isaiah 11:16 ;  35:8 ;  40:3 ;  62:10 ) under the figure of the preparation of a grand thoroughfare for their march.  </p><p> During their possession of Palestine the Romans constructed several important highways, as they did in all countries which they ruled. </p>
Hilkiah	<p>portion of Jehovah. </p><li> 1 Chronicles 6:54 . </li><li> 1 Chronicles 26:11 . </li><li> The father of Eliakim ( 2 Kings 18:18 2 Kings 18:26 2 Kings 18:37 ). </li><li> The father of Gemariah ( Jeremiah 29:3 ). </li><li> The father of the prophet ( Jeremiah 1:1 ).  </li><li> The high priest in the reign of Josiah ( 1 Chronicles 6:13 ;  Ezra 7:1 ). To him and his deputy ( 2 Kings 23:5 ), along with the ordinary priests and the Levites who had charge of the gates, was entrusted the purification of the temple in Jerusalem. While this was in progress, he discovered in some hidden corner of the building a book called the "book of the law" ( 2 Kings 22:8 ) and the "book of the covenant" ( 23:2 ). Some have supposed that this "book" was nothing else than the original autograph copy of the Pentateuch written by Moses ( Deuteronomy 31:9-26 ). This remarkable discovery occurred in the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign (B.C. 624), a discovery which permanently affected the whole subsequent history of Israel. (See JOSIAH;  SHAPHAN .) </li><li> Nehemiah 12:7 . </li><li> Nehemiah 8:4 .   </li>
Hill	<p></p><li> Heb. gib'eah, a curved or rounded hill, such as are common to Palestine ( Psalms 65:12 ;  72:3 ;  Psalms 114:4 Psalms 114:6 ).  </li><li> Heb. har, properly a mountain range rather than an individual eminence ( Exodus 24:4 Exodus 24:12 Exodus 24:13 Exodus 24:18 ;  Numbers 14:40 Numbers 14:44 Numbers 14:45 ). In  Deuteronomy 1:7 ,  Joshua 9:1 ;  10:40 ;  11:16 , it denotes the elevated district of Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim, which forms the watershed between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea.  </li><li> Heb. ma'aleh in  1 Samuel 9:11 . Authorized Version "hill" is correctly rendered in the Revised Version "ascent."  </li><li> In  Luke 9:37  the "hill" is the Mount of Transfiguration.   </li>
Hill of Evil Counsel	<p>on the south of the Valley of Hinnom. It is so called from a tradition that the house of the high priest Caiaphas, when the rulers of the Jews resolved to put Christ to death, stood here. </p>
Hillel	<p>praising, a Pirathonite, father of the judge Abdon ( Judges 12:13 Judges 12:15 ).  </p>
Hind	<p>Heb. 'ayalah ( 2 Samuel 22:34 ;  Psalms 18:33 , etc.) and 'ayeleth ( Psalms 22 , title), the female of the hart or stag. It is referred to as an emblem of activity ( Genesis 49:21 ), gentleness ( Proverbs 5:19 ), feminine modesty (Cant  2:7 ;  3:5 ), earnest longing ( Psalms 42:1 ), timidity ( Psalms 29:9 ). In the title of  Psalms 22 , the word probably refers to some tune bearing that name.  </p>
Hinge	<p>(Heb. tsir), that on which a door revolves. "Doors in the East turn rather on pivots than on what we term hinges. In Syria, and especially in the Hauran, there are many ancient doors, consisting of stone slabs with pivots carved out of the same piece inserted in sockets above and below, and fixed during the building of the house" ( Proverbs 26:14 ).  </p>
Hinnom	<p>a deep, narrow ravine separating Mount Zion from the so-called "Hill of Evil Counsel." It took its name from "some ancient hero, the son of Hinnom." It is first mentioned in  Joshua 15:8 . It had been the place where the idolatrous Jews burned their children alive to Moloch and Baal. A particular part of the valley was called Tophet, or the "fire-stove," where the children were burned. After the Exile, in order to show their abhorrence of the locality, the Jews made this valley the receptacle of the offal of the city, for the destruction of which a fire was, as is supposed, kept constantly burning there.  </p><p> The Jews associated with this valley these two ideas, (1) that of the sufferings of the victims that had there been sacrificed; and (2) that of filth and corruption. It became thus to the popular mind a symbol of the abode of the wicked hereafter. It came to signify hell as the place of the wicked. "It might be shown by infinite examples that the Jews expressed hell, or the place of the damned, by this word. The word Gehenna [the Greek contraction of Hinnom] was never used in the time of Christ in any other sense than to denote the place of future punishment." About this fact there can be no question. In this sense the word is used eleven times in our Lord's discourses ( Matthew 23:33 ;  Luke 12:5 ;  Matthew 5:22 , etc.).  </p>
Hiram	<p>high-born. </p><li> Generally "Huram," one of the sons of Bela ( 1 Chronicles 8:5 ).  </li><li> Also "Huram" and "Horam," king of Tyre. He entered into an alliance with David, and assisted him in building his palace by sending him able workmen, and also cedar-trees and fir-trees from Lebanon ( 2 Samuel 5:11 ;  1 Chronicles 14:1 ). After the death of David he entered into a similar alliance with Solomon, and assisted him greatly in building the temple ( 1 Kings 5:1 ;  9:11 ;  2 Chr  2:3 ). He also took part in Solomon's traffic to the Eastern Seas ( 1 Kings 9:27 ;  10:11 ;  2 Chr  8:18 ;  9:10 ).  </li><li> The "master workman" whom Hiram sent to Solomon. He was the son of a widow of Dan, and of a Tyrian father. In  2 Chronicles 2:13  "Huram my father" should be Huram Abi, the word "Abi" (rendered here "my father") being regarded as a proper name, or it may perhaps be a title of distinction given to Huram, and equivalent to "master." (Compare  1 Kings 7:14 ;  2 Chr  4:16 .) He cast the magnificent brazen works for Solomon's temple in clay-beds in the valley of Jordan, between Succoth and Zarthan.   </li>
Hireling	<p>a labourer employed on hire for a limited time ( Job 7:1 ;  14:6 ;  Mark 1:20 ). His wages were paid as soon as his work was over ( Leviticus 19:13 ). In the time of our Lord a day's wage was a "penny" (q.v.) i.e., a Roman denarius ( Matthew 20:1-14 ).  </p>
Hiss	<p>to express contempt ( Job 27:23 ). The destruction of the temple is thus spoken of ( 1 Kings 9:8 ). ( Zechariah 10:8 ) speaks of the Lord gathering the house of Judah as it were with a hiss: "I will hiss for them." This expression may be "derived from the noise made to attract bees in hiving, or from the sound naturally made to attract a person's attention."  </p>
Hittites	<p>Palestine and Syria appear to have been originally inhabited by three different tribes. </p><li> The Semites, living on the east of the isthmus of Suez. They were nomadic and pastoral tribes. </li><li> The Phoenicians, who were merchants and traders; and </li><li> the Hittites, who were the warlike element of this confederation of tribes. They inhabited the whole region between the Euphrates and Damascus, their chief cities being Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Kadesh, now Tell Neby Mendeh, in the Orontes valley, about six miles south of the Lake of Homs. These Hittites seem to have risen to great power as a nation, as for a long time they were formidable rivals of the Egyptian and Assyrian empires. In the book of Joshua they always appear as the dominant race to the north of Galilee.  <p> Somewhere about the twenty-third century B.C. the Syrian confederation, led probably by the Hittites, arched against Lower Egypt, which they took possession of, making Zoan their capital. Their rulers were the Hyksos, or shepherd kings. They were at length finally driven out of Egypt. Rameses II. sought vengeance against the "vile Kheta," as he called them, and encountered and defeated them in the great battle of Kadesh, four centuries after Abraham. (See JOSHUA .) </p><p> They are first referred to in Scripture in the history of Abraham, who bought from Ephron the Hittite the field and the cave of Machpelah ( Genesis 15:20 :  23:3-18 ). They were then settled at Kirjath-arba. From this tribe Esau took his first two wives ( 26:34 ;  36:2 ).  </p><p> They are afterwards mentioned in the usual way among the inhabitants of the Promised Land ( Exodus 23:28 ). They were closely allied to the Amorites, and are frequently mentioned along with them as inhabiting the mountains of Palestine. When the spies entered the land they seem to have occupied with the Amorites the mountain region of Judah ( Numbers 13:29 ). They took part with the other Canaanites against the Israelites ( Joshua 9:1 ;  11:3 ).  </p><p> After this there are few references to them in Scripture. Mention is made of "Ahimelech the Hittite" ( 1 Samuel 26:6 ), and of "Uriah the Hittite," one of David's chief officers ( 2 Samuel 23:39 ;  1 Chronicles 11:41 ). In the days of Solomon they were a powerful confederation in the north of Syria, and were ruled by "kings." They are met with after the Exile still a distinct people ( Ezra 9:1 ; Compare  Nehemiah 13:23-28 ).  </p><p> The Hebrew merchants exported horses from Egypt not only for the kings of Israel, but also for the Hittites ( 1 Kings 10:28 1 Kings 10:29 ). From the Egyptian monuments we learn that "the Hittites were a people with yellow skins and 'Mongoloid' features, whose receding foreheads, oblique eyes, and protruding upper jaws are represented as faithfully on their own monuments as they are on those of Egypt, so that we cannot accuse the Egyptian artists of caricaturing their enemies. The Amorites, on the contrary, were a tall and handsome people. They are depicted with white skins, blue eyes, and reddish hair, all the characteristics, in fact, of the white race" (Sayce's The Hittites). The original seat of the Hittite tribes was the mountain ranges of Taurus. They belonged to Asia Minor, and not to Syria.  </p> </li>
Hivites	<p>one of the original tribes scattered over Palestine, from Hermon to Gibeon in the south. The name is interpreted as "midlanders" or "villagers" ( Genesis 10:17 ;  1 Chronicles 1:15 ). They were probably a branch of the Hittites. At the time of Jacob's return to Canaan, Hamor the Hivite was the "prince of the land" ( Genesis 24:2-28 ).  </p><p> They are next mentioned during the Conquest ( Joshua 9:7 ;  11:19 ). They principally inhabited the northern confines of Western Palestine ( Joshua 11:3 ;  Judges 3:3 ). A remnant of them still existed in the time of Solomon ( 1 Kings 9:20 ).  </p>
Hizkiah	<p>an ancestor of the prophet ( Zephaniah 1:1 ).  </p>
Hizkijah	<p>( Nehemiah 10:17 ), one who sealed the covenant.  </p>
Hobab	<p>beloved, the Kenite, has been usually identified with Jethro (q.v.),  Exodus 18:5 Exodus 18:27 ; Compare  Numbers 10:29 Numbers 10:30 . In  Judges 4:11 , the word rendered "father-in-law" means properly any male relative by marriage (Compare  Genesis 19:14 , "son-in-law," A.V.), and should be rendered "brother-in-law," as in the RSV His descendants followed Israel to Canaan ( Numbers 10:29 ), and at first pitched their tents near Jericho, but afterwards settled in the south in the borders of Arad ( Judges 1:8-11 Judges 1:16 ).  </p>
Hobah	<p>hiding-place, a place to the north of Damascus, to which Abraham pursued Chedorlaomer and his confederates ( Genesis 14:15 ).  </p>
Hodijah	<p>majesty of Jehovah. </p><li> One of the Levites who assisted Ezra in expounding the law ( Nehemiah 8:7 ;  9:5 ). </li><li> Nehemiah 10:18 , a Levite who sealed the covenant.   </li>
Hoglah	<p>partridge, one of the daughters of Zelophehad the Gileadite, to whom portions were assigned by Moses ( Numbers 26:33 ;  27:1 ;  36:11 ).  </p>
Hoham	<p>Jehovah impels, the king of Hebron who joined the league against Gibeon. He and his allies were defeated ( Joshua 10:3 Joshua 10:5 Joshua 10:16-27 ).  </p>
Hold	<p>a fortress, the name given to David's lurking-places ( 1 Samuel 22:4 1 Samuel 22:5 ;  24:22 ).  </p>
Holiness	<p>in the highest sense belongs to God ( Isaiah 6:3 ;  Revelation 15:4 ), and to Christians as consecrated to God's service, and in so far as they are conformed in all things to the will of God ( Romans 6:19 Romans 6:22 ;  Ephesians 1:4 ;  Titus 1:8 ;  1 Peter 1:15 ). Personal holiness is a work of gradual development. It is carried on under many hindrances, hence the frequent admonitions to watchfulness, prayer, and perseverance ( 1 Corinthians 1:30 ;  2 co  7:1 ;  Ephesians 4:23 Ephesians 4:24 ). (See SANCTIFICATION .) </p>
Holy Ghost	<p>the third Person of the adorable Trinity. </p><p> His personality is proved (1) from the fact that the attributes of personality, as intelligence and volition, are ascribed to him ( John 14:17 John 14:26 ;  15:26 ;  1 Corinthians 2:10 1 Corinthians 2:11 ;  12:11 ). He reproves, helps, glorifies, intercedes ( John 16:7-13 ;  Romans 8:26 ). (2) He executes the offices peculiar only to a person. The very nature of these offices involves personal distinction ( Luke 12:12 ;  Acts 5:32 ;  15:28 ;  16:6 ;  28:25 ;  1 Corinthians 2:13 ;  Hebrews 2:4 ;  3:7 ;  2 Pet  1:21 ).  </p><p> His divinity is established (1) from the fact that the names of God are ascribed to him ( Exodus 17:7 ;  Psalms 95:7 ; Compare  Hebrews 3:7-11 ); and (2) that divine attributes are also ascribed to him, omnipresence ( Psalms 139:7 ;  Ephesians 2:17 Ephesians 2:18 ;  1 Corinthians 12:13 ); omniscience ( 1 Corinthians 2:10 1 Corinthians 2:11 ); omnipotence ( Luke 1:35 ;  Romans 8:11 ); eternity ( Hebrews 9:4 ). (3) Creation is ascribed to him ( Genesis 1:2 ;  Job 26:13 ;  Psalms 104:30 ), and the working of miracles ( Matthew 12:28 ;  1 Corinthians 12:9-11 ). (4) Worship is required and ascribed to him ( Isaiah 6:3 ;  Acts 28:25 ;  Romans 9:1 ;  Revelation 1:4 ;  Matthew 28:19 ).  </p>
Holy of holies	<p>the second or interior portion of the tabernacle. It was left in total darkness. No one was permitted to enter it except the high priest, and that only once a year. It contained the ark of the covenant only ( Exodus 25:10-16 ). It was in the form of a perfect cube of 20 cubits. (See TABERNACLE .) </p>
Holy place	<p>one of the two portions into which the tabernacle was divided ( Exodus 26:31 ;  37:17-25 ;  Hebrews 9:2 ). It was 20 cubits long and 10 in height and breadth. It was illuminated by the golden candlestick, as it had no opening to admit the light. It contained the table of showbread ( Exodus 25:23-29 ) and the golden altar of incense ( 30:1-11 ). It was divided from the holy of holies by a veil of the most costly materials and the brightest colours.  </p><p> The arrangement of the temple (q.v.) was the same in this respect. In it the walls of hewn stone were wainscotted with cedar and overlaid with gold, and adorned with beautiful carvings. It was entered from the porch by folding doors overlaid with gold and richly embossed. Outside the holy place stood the great tank or "sea" of molten brass, supported by twelve oxen, three turned each way, capable of containing two thousand baths of water. Besides this there were ten lavers and the brazen altar of burnt sacrifice. </p>
Homer	<p>heap, the largest of dry measures, containing about 8 bushels or 1 quarter English = 10 ephahs ( Leviticus 27:16 ;  Numbers 11:32 ) = a COR. (See OMER .) </p><p> "Half a homer," a grain measure mentioned only in  Hosea 3:2 .  </p>
Honey	<p></p><li> Heb. ya'ar, occurs only  1 Samuel 14:25 1 Samuel 14:27 1 Samuel 14:29 ; Cant  5:1 , where it denotes the honey of bees. Properly the word signifies a forest or copse, and refers to honey found in woods.  </li><li> Nopheth, honey that drops ( Psalms 19:10 ;  Proverbs 5:3 ; Cant.  4:11 ).  </li><li> Debash denotes bee-honey ( Judges 14:8 ); but also frequently a vegetable honey distilled from trees ( Genesis 43:11 ;  Ezekiel 27:17 ). In these passages it may probably mean "dibs," or syrup of grapes, i.e., the juice of ripe grapes boiled down to one-third of its bulk.  </li><li> Tsuph, the cells of the honey-comb full of honey ( Proverbs 16:24 ;  Psalms 19:10 ).  </li><li> "Wild honey" ( Matthew 3:4 ) may have been the vegetable honey distilled from trees, but rather was honey stored by bees in rocks or in trees ( Deuteronomy 32:13 ;  Psalms 81:16 ;  1 Samuel 14:25-29 ).  <p> Canaan was a "land flowing with milk and honey" ( Exodus 3:8 ). Milk and honey were among the chief dainties in the earlier ages, as they are now among the Bedawin; and butter and honey are also mentioned among articles of food ( Isaiah 7:15 ). The ancients used honey instead of sugar ( Psalms 119:103 ;  Proverbs 24:13 ); but when taken in great quantities it caused nausea, a fact referred to in Prov 25:16,17to inculcate moderation in pleasures. Honey and milk also are put for sweet discourse (Cant  4:11 ).  </p> </li>
Hood	<p>(Heb. tsaniph) a tiara round the head ( Isaiah 3:23 ; RSV, pl., "turbans"). Rendered "diadem,"  Job 29:14 ; high priest's "mitre,"  Zechariah 3:5 ; "royal diadem,"  Isaiah 62:3 .  </p>
Hoof	<p>a cleft hoof as of neat cattle ( Exodus 10:26 ;  Ezekiel 32:13 ); hence also of the horse, though not cloven ( Isaiah 5:28 ). The "parting of the hoof" is one of the distinctions between clean and unclean animals ( Leviticus 11:3 ;  Deuteronomy 14:7 ).  </p>
Hook	<p></p><li> Heb. hah, a "ring" inserted in the nostrils of animals to which a cord was fastened for the purpose of restraining them ( 2 Kings 19:28 ;  Isaiah 37:28 Isaiah 37:29 ;  Ezekiel 29:4 ;  38:4 ). "The Orientals make use of this contrivance for curbing their work-beasts...When a beast becomes unruly they have only to draw the cord on one side, which, by stopping his breath, punishes him so effectually that after a few repetitions he fails not to become quite tractable whenever he begins to feel it" (Michaelis). So God's agents are never beyond his control.  </li><li> Hakkah, a fish "hook" ( Job 41:2 , Heb. Text,  40:25 ;  Isaiah 19:8 ;  Habakkuk 1:15 ).  </li><li> Vav, a "peg" on which the curtains of the tabernacle were hung ( Exodus 26:32 ).  </li><li> Tsinnah, a fish-hooks ( Amos 4:2 ).  </li><li> Mazleg, flesh-hooks ( 1 Samuel 2:13 1 Samuel 2:14 ), a kind of fork with three teeth for turning the sacrifices on the fire, etc.  </li><li> Mazmeroth, pruning-hooks ( Isaiah 2:4 ;  Joel 3:10 ).  </li><li> 'Agmon ( Job 41:2 , Heb. Text  40:26 ), incorrectly rendered in the Authorized Version. Properly a rush-rope for binding animals, as in Revised Version margin.   </li>
Hope	<p>one of the three main elements of Christian character ( 1 Corinthians 13:13 ). It is joined to faith and love, and is opposed to seeing or possessing ( Romans 8:24 ;  1 John 3:2 ). "Hope is an essential and fundamental element of Christian life, so essential indeed, that, like faith and love, it can itself designate the essence of Christianity ( 1 Peter 3:15 ;  Hebrews 10:23 ). In it the whole glory of the Christian vocation is centred ( Ephesians 1:18 ;  4:4 )." Unbelievers are without this hope ( Ephesians 2:12 ;  1 Thessalonians 4:13 ). Christ is the actual object of the believer's hope, because it is in his second coming that the hope of glory will be fulfilled ( 1 Timothy 1:1 ;  Colossians 1:27 ;  Titus 2:13 ). It is spoken of as "lively", i.e., a living, hope, a hope not frail and perishable, but having a perennial life ( 1 Peter 1:3 ). In  Romans 5:2  the "hope" spoken of is probably objective, i.e., "the hope set before us," namely, eternal life (comp  12:12 ). In  1 John 3:3  the expression "hope in him" ought rather to be, as in the Revised Version, "hope on him," i.e., a hope based on God.  </p>
Hophni	<p>pugilist or client, one of the two sons of Eli, the high priest ( 1 Samuel 1:3 ;  2:34 ), who, because he was "very old," resigned to them the active duties of his office. By their scandalous conduct they brought down a curse on their father's house ( 1 Samuel 2:22 1 Samuel 2:12-27 1 Samuel 2:27-36 ;  3:11-14 ). For their wickedness they were called "sons of Belial," i.e., worthless men ( 2:12 ). They both perished in the disastrous battle with the Philistines at Aphek ( 4:11 ). (See PHINEHAS .) </p>
Hophra	<p>i.e., PHARAOH-HOPHRA (called Apries by the Greek historian Herodotus) king of Egypt (B.C. 591-572) in the time of Zedekiah, king of Judah ( Jeremiah 37:5 44:30 ;  Ezekiel 29:6 Ezekiel 29:7 ).  </p>
Hor	<p>mountain. </p><li> One of the mountains of the chain of Seir or Edom, on the confines of Idumea ( Numbers 20:22-29 ;  33:37 ). It was one of the stations of the Israelites in the wilderness ( 33:37 ), which they reached in the circuitous route they were obliged to take because the Edomites refused them a passage through their territory. It was during the encampment here that Aaron died ( Numbers 33:37-41 ). (See AARON .) The Israelites passed this mountain several times in their wanderings. It bears the modern name of Jebel Harun, and is the highest and most conspicious of the whole range. It stands about midway between the Dead Sea and the Elanitic gulf. It has two summits, in the hallow between which it is supposed that Aaron died. Others, however, suppose that this mountain is the modern Jebel Madurah, on the opposite, i.e., the western, side of the Arabah. </li><li> One of the marks of the northern boundary of Palestine ( Numbers 34:7 Numbers 34:8 ). Nowhere else mentioned. Perhaps it is one of the peaks of Lebanon.   </li>
Horeb	<p>desert or mountain of the dried-up ground, a general name for the whole mountain range of which Sinai was one of the summits ( Exodus 3:1 ;  17:6 ;  33:6 ;  Psalms 106:19 , etc.). The modern name of the whole range is Jebel Musa. It is a huge mountain block, about 2 miles long by about 1 in breadth, with a very spacious plain at its north-east end, called the Er Rahah, in which the Israelites encamped for nearly a whole year. (See SINAI .) </p>
Horem	<p>consecrated, one of the fenced cities of Naphtali ( Joshua 19:38 ).  </p>
Horites	<p>cave-men, a race of Troglodytes who dwelt in the limestone caves which abounded in Edom. Their ancestor was "Seir," who probably gave his name to the district where he lived. They were a branch of the Hivites ( Genesis 14:6 ;  36:20-30 ;  1 Chronicles 1:38 1 Chronicles 1:39 ). They were dispossessed by the descendants of Esau, and as a people gradually became extinct ( Deuteronomy 2:12-22 ).  </p>
Hormah	<p>banning; i.e., placing under a "ban," or devoting to utter destruction. After the manifestation of God's anger against the Israelites, on account of their rebellion and their murmurings when the spies returned to the camp at Kadesh, in the wilderness of Paran, with an evil report of the land, they quickly repented of their conduct, and presumed to go up "to the head of the mountain," seeking to enter the Promised Land, but without the presence of the Lord, without the ark of the convenant, and without Moses. The Amalekites and the Canaanites came down and "smote and discomfited them even unto Hormah" ( Numbers 14:45 ). This place, or perhaps the watch-tower commanding it, was originally called Zephath ( Judges 1:17 ), the modern Sebaiteh. Afterwards ( Numbers 21:1-3 ) Arad, the king of the Canaanites, at the close of the wanderings, when the Israelites were a second time encamped at Kadesh, "fought against them, and took some of them prisoners." But Israel vowed a vow unto the Lord utterly to destroy the cities of the Canaanites; they "banned" them, and hence the place was now called Hormah. But this "ban" was not fully executed till the time of Joshua, who finally conquered the king of this district, so that the ancient name Zephath became "Hormah" ( Joshua 12:14 ;  Judges 1:17 ).  </p>
Horn	<p>Trumpets were at first horns perforated at the tip, used for various purposes ( Joshua 6:4 Joshua 6:5 ).  </p><p> Flasks or vessels were made of horn ( 1 Samuel 16:1 1 Samuel 16:13 ;  1 Kings 1:39 ).  </p><p> But the word is used also metaphorically to denote the projecting corners of the altar of burnt offerings ( Exodus 27:2 ) and of incense ( 30:2 ). The horns of the altar of burnt offerings were to be smeared with the blood of the slain bullock ( 29:12 ;  Leviticus 4:7-18 ). The criminal, when his crime was accidental, found an asylum by laying hold of the horns of the altar ( 1 Kings 1:50 ;  2:28 ).  </p><p> The word also denotes the peak or summit of a hill ( Isaiah 5:1 , where the word "hill" is the rendering of the same Hebrew word).  </p><p> This word is used metaphorically also for strength ( Deuteronomy 33:17 ) and honour ( Job 16:15 ;  Lamentations 2:3 ). Horns are emblems of power, dominion, glory, and fierceness, as they are the chief means of attack and defence with the animals endowed with them ( Daniel 8:5 Daniel 8:9 ;  1 Samuel 2:1 ;  1 Samuel 16:1 1 Samuel 16:13 ;  1 Kings 1:39 ;  22:11 ;  Joshua 6:4 Joshua 6:5 ;  Psalms 75:5 Psalms 75:10 ;  132:17 ;  Luke 1:69 , etc.). The expression "horn of salvation," applied to Christ, means a salvation of strength, or a strong Saviour ( Luke 1:69 ). To have the horn "exalted" denotes prosperity and triumph ( Psalms 89:17 Psalms 89:24 ). To "lift up" the horn is to act proudly ( Zechariah 1:21 ).  </p><p> Horns are also the symbol of royal dignity and power ( Jeremiah 48:25 ;  Zechariah 1:18 ;  Daniel 8:24 ).  </p>
Hornet	<p>Heb. tsir'ah, "stinging", ( Exodus 23:28 ;  Deuteronomy 7:20 ;  Joshua 24:12 ). The word is used in these passages as referring to some means by which the Canaanites were to be driven out from before the Israelites. Some have supposed that the word is used in a metaphorical sense as the symbol of some panic which would seize the people as a "terror of God" ( Genesis 35:5 ), the consternation with which God would inspire the Canaanites. In Palestine there are four species of hornets, differing from our hornets, being larger in size, and they are very abundant. They "attack human beings in a very furious manner." "The furious attack of a swarm of hornets drives cattle and horses to madness, and has even caused the death of the animals."  </p>
Horonaim	<p>two caverns, a city of Moab to the south of the Arnon, built, apparently, upon an eminence, and a place of some importance ( Isaiah 15:5 ;  Jeremiah 48:3 Jeremiah 48:5 Jeremiah 48:34 ).  </p>
Horonite	<p>the designation of Sanballat ( Nehemiah 2:10 Nehemiah 2:19 ), a native of Horonaim, or of one of the two Beth-horons, the "upper" or the "nether," mentioned in  Joshua 16:3 Joshua 16:5 .  </p>
Horse	<p>always referred to in the Bible in connection with warlike operations, except  Isaiah 28:28 . The war-horse is described  Job 39:19-25 . For a long period after their settlement in Canaan the Israelites made no use of horses, according to the prohibition,  Deuteronomy 17:16 . David was the first to form a force of cavalry ( 2 Samuel 8:4 ). But Solomon, from his connection with Egypt, greatly multiplied their number ( 1 Kings 4:26 ;  1 Kings 10:26 1 Kings 10:29 ). After this, horses were freely used in Israel ( 1 Kings 22:4 ;  2 Kings  3:7 ;  1 Kings 9:21  1 Kings 9:33 ;  11:16 ). The furniture of the horse consisted simply of a bridle ( Isaiah 30:28 ) and a curb ( Psalms 32:9 ).  </p>
Horse-gate	<p>a gate in the wall of Jerusalem, at the west end of the bridge, leading from Zion to the temple ( Nehemiah 3:28 ;  Jeremiah 31:40 ).  </p>
Horse-leech	<p>occurs only in  Proverbs 30:15  (Heb. 'alukah); the generic name for any blood-sucking annelid. There are various species in the marshes and pools of Palestine. That here referred to, the Hoemopis, is remarkable for the coarseness of its bite, and is therefore not used for medical purposes. They are spoken of in the East with feelings of aversion and horror, because of their propensity to fasten on the tongue and nostrils of horses when they come to drink out of the pools. The medicinal leech (Hirudo medicinalis), besides other species of leeches, are common in the waters of Syria.  </p>
Horseman	<p>Heb. ba'al parash, "master of a horse." The "horsemen" mentioned  Exodus 14:9  were "mounted men", i.e., men who rode in chariots. The army of Pharaoh consisted of a chariot and infantry force. We find that at a later period, however, the Egyptians had cavalry ( 2 Chronicles 12:3 ). (See HORSE .) </p>
Hosah	<p>refuge. </p><li> A place on the border of the tribe of Asher ( Joshua 19:29 ), a little to the south of Zidon.  </li><li> A Levite of the family of Merari ( 1 Chronicles 16:38 ).   </li>
Hosanna	<p>Save now! or Save, we beseech, ( Matthew 21:9 ). This was a customary form of acclamation at the feast of Tabernacles. (Compare  Psalms 118:25 .)  </p>
Hose	<p>( Daniel 3:21 ), a tunic or undergarment.  </p>
Hosea	<p>salvation, the son of Beeri, and author of the book of prophecies bearing his name. He belonged to the kingdom of Israel. "His Israelitish origin is attested by the peculiar, rough, Aramaizing diction, pointing to the northern part of Palestine; by the intimate acquaintance he evinces with the localities of Ephraim ( 5:1 ;  Daniel 6:8 Daniel 6:9 ;  12:12 ;  <span class="badLink">14:6</span> , etc.); by passages like  1:2 , where the kingdom is styled 'the land', and  7:5 , where the Israelitish king is designated as 'our' king." The period of his ministry (extending to some sixty years) is indicated in the superscription ( Hosea 1:1 Hosea 1:2 ). He is the only prophet of Israel who has left any written prophecy.  </p>
Hosea, Prophecies of	<p>This book stands first in order among the "Minor Prophets." "The probable cause of the location of Hosea may be the thoroughly national character of his oracles, their length, their earnest tone, and vivid representations." This was the longest of the prophetic books written before the Captivity. Hosea prophesied in a dark and melancholy period of Israel's history, the period of Israel's decline and fall. Their sins had brought upon them great national disasters. "Their homicides and fornication, their perjury and theft, their idolatry and impiety, are censured and satirized with a faithful severity." He was a contemporary of Isaiah. The book may be divided into two parts, the first containing chapters 1-3, and symbolically representing the idolatry of Israel under imagery borrowed from the matrimonial relation. The figures of marriage and adultery are common in the Old Testament writings to represent the spiritual relations between Jehovah and the people of Israel. Here we see the apostasy of Israel and their punishment, with their future repentance, forgiveness, and restoration.  </p><p> The second part, containing 4-14, is a summary of Hosea's discourses, filled with denunciations, threatenings, exhortations, promises, and revelations of mercy.  </p><p> Quotations from Hosea are found in  Matthew 2:15 ;  9:15 ;  12:7 ;  Romans 9:25 Romans 9:26 . There are, in addition, various allusions to it in other places ( Luke 23:30 ;  Revelation 6:16 , Compare  Hosea 10:8 ;  Romans 9:25 Romans 9:26 ;  1 Peter 2:10 , Compare  Hosea 1:10 , etc.).  </p><p> As regards the style of this writer, it has been said that "each verse forms a whole for itself, like one heavy toll in a funeral knell." "Inversions ( 7:8 ;  Hosea 9:11 Hosea 9:13 ;  12: :  8 ), anacolutha ( 9:6 ;  12:8 , etc.), ellipses ( 9:4 ;  13:9 , etc.), paranomasias, and plays upon words, are very characteristic of ( Hosea 8:7 ;  9:15 ;  10:5 ;  11:5 ;  12:11 )."  </p>
Hoshea	<p>salvation. </p><li> The original name of the son of Nun, afterwards called Joshua ( Numbers 13:8 Numbers 13:16 ;  Deuteronomy 32:44 ).  </li><li> 1 Chronicles 27:20 . The ruler of Ephraim in David's time.  </li><li> The last king of Israel. He conspired against and slew his predecessor, Pekah ( Isaiah 7:16 ), but did not ascend the throne till after an interregnum of warfare of eight years ( 2 Kings 17:1 2 Kings 17:2 ). Soon after this he submitted to Shalmaneser, the Assyrian king, who a second time invaded the land to punish Hoshea, because of his withholding tribute which he had promised to pay. A second revolt brought back the Assyrian king Sargon, who besieged Samaria, and carried the ten tribes away beyond the Euphrates, B.C. 720 ( 2 Kings 17:5 2 Kings 17:6 ;  18:9-12 ). No more is heard of Hoshea. He disappeared like "foam upon the water" ( Hosea 10:7 ;  13:11 ).   </li>
Host	<p>an entertainer ( Romans 16:23 ); a tavern-keeper, the keeper of a caravansary ( Luke 10:35 ).  </p><p> In warfare, a troop or military force. This consisted at first only of infantry. Solomon afterwards added cavalry ( 1 Kings 4:26 ;  10:26 ). Every male Israelite from twenty to fifty years of age was bound by the law to bear arms when necessary ( Numbers 1:3 ;  26:2 ;  2 Chr  25:5 ).  </p><p> Saul was the first to form a standing army ( 1 Samuel 13:2 ;  24:2 ). This example was followed by David ( 1 Chronicles 27:1 ), and Solomon ( 1 Kings 4:26 ), and by the kings of Israel and Judah ( 2 Chronicles 17:14 ;  26:11 ;  2 Kings  11:4 , etc.).  </p>
Host of heaven	<p>The sun, moon, and stars are so designated ( Genesis 2:1 ). When the Jews fell into idolatry they worshipped these ( Deuteronomy 4:19 ;  2 Kings  17:16 ;  Deuteronomy 21:3 Deuteronomy 21:5 ;  23:5 ;  Jeremiah 19:13 ;  Zephaniah 1:5 ;  Acts 7:42 ).  </p>
Hostage	<p>a person delivered into the hands of another as a security for the performance of some promise, etc. ( 2 Kings 14:14 ;  2 Chr.  25:24 ).  </p>
Hough	<p>to hamstring, i.e., sever the "tendon of Achilles" of the hinder legs of captured horses ( Joshua 11:6 ;  2 Sam  8:4 ;  1 Chronicles 18:4 ), so as to render them useless.  </p>
Hour	<p>First found in  Daniel 3:6 ;  Daniel 4:19 Daniel 4:33 Daniel 5:5 . It is the rendering of the Chaldee shaah, meaning a "moment," a "look." It is used in the New Testament frequently to denote some determinate season ( Matthew 8:13 ;  Luke 12:39 ).  </p><p> With the ancient Hebrews the divisions of the day were "morning, evening, and noon-day" ( Psalms 55:17 , etc.). The Greeks, following the Babylonians, divided the day into twelve hours. The Jews, during the Captivity, learned also from the Babylonians this method of dividing time. When Judea became subject to the Romans, the Jews adopted the Roman mode of reckoning time. The night was divided into four watches ( Luke 12:38 ;  Matthew 14:25 ;  13:25 ). Frequent allusion is also made to hours ( Matthew 25:13 ;  26:40 , etc.). (See DAY .) </p><p> An hour was the twelfth part of the day, reckoning from sunrise to sunset, and consequently it perpetually varied in length. </p>
House	<p>Till their sojourn in Egypt the Hebrews dwelt in tents. They then for the first time inhabited cities ( Genesis 47:3 ;  Exodus 12:7 ;  Hebrews 11:9 ). From the earliest times the Assyrians and the Canaanites were builders of cities. The Hebrews after the Conquest took possession of the captured cities, and seem to have followed the methods of building that had been pursued by the Canaanites. Reference is made to the stone ( 1 Kings 7:9 ;  Isaiah 9:10 ) and marble ( 1 Chronicles 29:2 ) used in building, and to the internal wood-work of the houses ( 1 Kings 6:15 ;  7:2 ;  1 Kings 10:11 1 Kings 10:12 ;  2 Chr  3:5 ;  Jeremiah 22:14 ). "Ceiled houses" were such as had beams inlaid in the walls to which wainscotting was fastened ( Ezra 6:4 ;  Jeremiah 22:14 ;  Haggai 1:4 ). "Ivory houses" had the upper parts of the walls adorned with figures in stucco with gold and ivory ( 1 Kings 22:39 ;  2 Chr  3:6 ;  Psalms 45:8 ).  </p><p> The roofs of the dwelling-houses were flat, and are often alluded to in Scripture ( 2 Samuel 11:2 ;  Isaiah 22:1 ;  Matthew 24:17 ). Sometimes tents or booths were erected on them ( 2 Samuel 16:22 ). They were protected by parapets or low walls ( Deuteronomy 22:8 ). On the house-tops grass sometimes grew ( Proverbs 19:13 ;  27:15 ;  Psalms 129:6 Psalms 129:7 ). They were used, not only as places of recreation in the evening, but also sometimes as sleeping-places at night ( 1 Samuel 9:25 1 Samuel 9:26 ;  2 Sam  11:2 ;  16:22 ;  Daniel 4:29 ;  Job 27:18 ;  Proverbs 21:9 ), and as places of devotion ( Jeremiah 32:29 ;  19:13 ).  </p>
Hukkok	<p>decreed, a town near Zebulun, not far from Jordan, on the border of Naphtali ( Joshua 19:34 ). (See HELKATH .) </p>
Hul	<p>circle, the second son of Aram ( Genesis 10:23 ), and grandson of Shem.  </p>
Huldah	<p>weasel, a prophetess; the wife of Shallum. She was consulted regarding the "book of the law" discovered by the high priest Hilkiah ( 2 Kings 22:14-20 ;  2 Chr  34:22-28 ). She resided in that part of Jerusalem called the Mishneh (A.V., "the college;" RSV, "the second quarter"), supposed by some to be the suburb between the inner and the outer wall, the second or lower city, Akra. Miriam ( Exodus 15:20 ) and Deborah ( Judges 4:4 ) are the only others who bear the title of "prophetess," for the word in  Isaiah 8:3  means only the prophet's wife.  </p>
Humiliation of Christ	<p>(Phil  2:8 ), seen in (1) his birth ( Galatians 4:4 ;  Luke 2:7 ;  John 1:46 ;  Hebrews 2:9 ), (2) his circumstances, (3) his reputation ( Isaiah 53 ;  Matthew 26:59 Matthew 26:67 ;  Psalms 22:6 ;  Matthew 26:68 ), (4) his soul ( Psalms 22:1 ;  Matthew 4:1-11 ;  Luke 22:44 ;  Hebrews 2:17 Hebrews 2:18 ;  4:15 ), (5) his death ( Luke 23 ;  John 19 ;  Mark 15:24 Mark 15:25 ), (6) and his burial ( Isaiah 53:9 ;  Matthew 27:57 Matthew 27:58 Matthew 27:60 ).  </p><p> His humiliation was necessary (1) to execute the purpose of God ( Acts 2:23 Acts 2:24 ;  Psalms 40:6-8 ), (2) fulfil the Old Testament types and prophecies, (3) satisfy the law in the room of the guilty ( Isaiah 53 ;  Hebrews 9:12 Hebrews 9:15 ), procure for them eternal redemption, (4) and to show us an example.  </p>
Humility	<p>a prominent Christian grace ( Romans 12:3 ;  Romans 15:17 Romans 15:18 ;  1 Corinthians 3:5-7 ;  2 co  3:5 ; Phil  4:11-13 ). It is a state of mind well pleasing to God ( 1 Peter 3:4 ); it preserves the soul in tranquillity ( Psalms 69:32 Psalms 69:33 ), and makes us patient under trials ( Job 1:22 ).  </p><p> Christ has set us an example of humility (Phil  2:6-8 ). We should be led thereto by a remembrance of our sins ( Lamentations 3:39 ), and by the thought that it is the way to honour ( Proverbs 16:18 ), and that the greatest promises are made to the humble ( Psalms 147:6 ;  Isaiah 57:15 ;  66:2 ;  1 Peter 5:5 ). It is a "great paradox in Christianity that it makes humility the avenue to glory."  </p>
Hunting	<p>mentioned first in  Genesis 10:9  in connection with Nimrod. Esau was "a cunning hunter" ( Genesis 25:27 ). Hunting was practised by the Hebrews after their settlement in the "Land of Promise" ( Leviticus 17:15 ;  Proverbs 12:27 ). The lion and other ravenous beasts were found in Palestine ( 1 Samuel 17:34 ;  2 Sam  23:20 ;  1 Kings 13:24 ;  Ezekiel 19:3-8 ), and it must have been necessary to hunt and destroy them. Various snares and gins were used in hunting ( Psalms 91:3 ;  Amos 3:5 ;  2 Sam  23:20 ).  </p><p> War is referred to under the idea of hunting ( Jeremiah 16:16 ;  Ezekiel 32:30 ).  </p>
Hur	<p>a hole, as of a viper, etc. </p><li> A son of Caleb ( 1 Chronicles 2:19 1 Chronicles 2:50 ;  1 Chronicles 4:1 1 Chronicles 4:4 ; Compare  2 Chronicles 1:5 ).  </li><li> The husband of Miriam, Moses' sister ( Exodus 17:10-12 ). He was associated with Aaron in charge of the people when Moses was absent on Sinai ( Exodus 24:14 ). He was probably of the tribe of Judah, and grandfather of Bezaleel ( Exodus 31:2 ;  35:30 ;  1 Chronicles 2:19 ).  </li><li> One of the five princes of Midian who were defeated and slain by the Israelites under the command of Phinehas ( Numbers 31:8 ).   </li>
Hurai	<p>linen-worker, one of David's heroes, a native of the valley of Mount Gaash ( 1 Chronicles 11:32 ).  </p>
Husband	<p>i.e., the "house-band," connecting and keeping together the whole family. A man when betrothed was esteemed from that time a husband ( Matthew 1:16 Matthew 1:20 ;  Luke 2:5 ). A recently married man was exempt from going to war for "one year" ( Deuteronomy 20:7 ;  24:5 ).  </p>
Husbandman	<p>one whose business it is to cultivate the ground. It was one of the first occupations, and was esteemed most honourable ( Genesis 9:20 ;  Genesis 26:12 Genesis 26:14 ;  37:7 , etc.). All the Hebrews, except those engaged in religious services, were husbandmen. (See AGRICULTURE .) </p>
Hushai	<p>quick, "the Archite," "the king's friend" ( 1 Chronicles 27:33 ). When David fled from Jerusalem, on account of the rebellion of Absalom, and had reached the summit of Olivet, he there met Hushai, whom he sent back to Jerusalem for the purpose of counteracting the influence of Ahithophel, who had joined the ranks of Absalom ( 2 Samuel 15:32 2 Samuel 15:37 ;  16:16-18 ). It was by his advice that Absalom refrained from immediately pursuing after David. By this delay the cause of Absalom was ruined, for it gave David time to muster his forces.  </p>
Husk	<p>In  Numbers 6:4  (Heb. zag) it means the "skin" of a grape. In  2 Kings 4:42  (Heb. tsiqlon) it means a "sack" for grain, as rendered in the Revised Version. In  Luke 15:16 , in the parable of the Prodigal Son, it designates the beans of the carob tree, or Ceratonia siliqua. From the supposition, mistaken, however, that it was on the husks of this tree that John the Baptist fed, it is called "St. John's bread" and "locust tree." This tree is in "February covered with innumerable purple-red pendent blossoms, which ripen in April and May into large crops of pods from 6 to 10 inches long, flat, brown, narrow, and bent like a horn (whence the Greek name keratia, meaning 'little horns'), with a sweetish taste when still unripe. Enormous quantities of these are gathered for sale in various towns and for exportation." "They were eaten as food, though only by the poorest of the poor, in the time of our Lord." The bean is called a "gerah," which is used as the name of the smallest Hebrew weight, twenty of these making a shekel.  </p>
Hymn	<p>occurs only  Ephesians 5:19  and  Colossians 3:16 . The verb to "sing an hymn" occurs  Matthew 26:30  and  Mark 14:26 . The same Greek word is rendered to "sing praises"  Acts 16:25  (RSV, "sing hymns") and  Hebrews 2:12 . The "hymn" which our Lord sang with his disciples at the last Supper is generally supposed to have been the latter part of the Hallel, comprehending  <span class="badLink">Psalms 113118</span> -118. It was thus a name given to a number of psalms taken together and forming a devotional exercise.  </p><p> The noun hymn is used only with reference to the services of the Greeks, and was distinguished from the psalm. The Greek tunes required Greek hymns. Our information regarding the hymnology of the early Christians is very limited. </p>
Hypocrite	<p>one who puts on a mask and feigns himself to be what he is not; a dissembler in religion. Our Lord severely rebuked the scribes and Pharisees for their hypocrisy ( Matthew 6:2 Matthew 6:5 Matthew 6:16 ). "The hypocrite's hope shall perish" ( Job 8:13 ). The Hebrew word here rendered "hypocrite" rather means the "godless" or "profane," as it is rendered in  Jeremiah 23:11 , i.e., polluted with crimes.  </p>
Hyssop	<p>(Heb. 'ezob; LXX. hyssopos), first mentioned in  Exodus 12:22  in connection with the institution of the Passover. We find it afterwards mentioned in  Leviticus 14:4 Leviticus 14:6 Leviticus 14:52 ;  Numbers 19:6 Numbers 19:18 ;  Hebrews 9:19 . It is spoken of as a plant "springing out of the wall" ( 1 Kings 4:33 ). Many conjectures have been formed as to what this plant really was. Some contend that it was a species of marjoram (origanum), six species of which are found in Palestine. Others with more probability think that it was the caper plant, the Capparis spinosa of Linnaeus. This plant grew in Egypt, in the desert of Sinai, and in Palestine. It was capable of producing a stem three or four feet in length ( Matthew 27:48 ;  Mark 15:36 . Compare  John 19:29 ).  </p>
Irad	<p>runner; wild ass, one of the antediluvian patriarchs, the father of Mehujael ( Genesis 4:18 ), and grandson of Cain.  </p>
Iram	<p>citizen, chief of an Edomite tribe in Mount Seir ( Genesis 36:43 ).  </p>
Irha-heres	<p>according to some MSS., meaning "city of destruction." Other MSS. read <i> 'Irhahares</i> ; rendered "city of the sun",  Isaiah 19:18 , where alone the word occurs. This name may probably refer to Heliopolis. The prophecy here points to a time when the Jews would so increase in number there as that the city would fall under their influence. This might be in the time of the Ptolemies. (See ON .) </p>
Iron	<p>Tubal-Cain is the first-mentioned worker in iron ( Genesis 4:22 ). The Egyptians wrought it at Sinai before the Exodus. David prepared it in great abundance for the temple ( 1 Chronicles 22:3 :  29:7 ). The merchants of Dan and Javan brought it to the market of Tyre ( Ezekiel 27:19 ). Various instruments are mentioned as made of iron ( Deuteronomy 27:5 ;  19:5 ;  Joshua 17:16 Joshua 17:18 ;  1 Samuel 17:7 ;  2 Sam.  12:31 ;  2 Kings  1 Samuel 6:5 1 Samuel 6:6 ;  1 Chronicles 22:3 ;  Isaiah 10:34 ).  </p><p> Figuratively, a yoke of iron ( Deuteronomy 28:48 ) denotes hard service; a rod of iron ( Psalms 2:9 ), a stern government; a pillar of iron ( Jeremiah 1:18 ), a strong support; a furnace of iron ( Deuteronomy 4:20 ), severe labour; a bar of iron ( Job 40:18 ), strength; fetters of iron ( Psalms 107:10 ), affliction; giving silver for iron ( Isaiah 60:17 ), prosperity.  </p>
Irrigation	<p>As streams were few in Palestine, water was generally stored up in winter in reservoirs, and distributed through gardens in numerous rills, which could easily be turned or diverted by the foot ( Deuteronomy 11:10 ).  </p><p> For purposes of irrigation, water was raised from streams or pools by water-wheels, or by a shaduf, commonly used on the banks of the Nile to the present day. </p>
Isaac	<p>laughter. (1) Israel, or the kingdom of the ten tribes ( Amos 7:9 Amos 7:16 ).  </p><li> The only son of Abraham by Sarah. He was the longest lived of the three patriarchs ( Genesis 21:1-3 ). He was circumcised when eight days old (4-7); and when he was probably two years old a great feast was held in connection with his being weaned.  <p> The next memorable event in his life is that connected with the command of God given to Abraham to offer him up as a sacrifice on a mountain in the land of Moriah ( Genesis 22 ). (See ABRAHAM .) When he was forty years of age Rebekah was chosen for his wife ( Genesis 24 ). After the death and burial of his father he took up his residence at Beer-lahai-roi ( 25:7-11 ), where his two sons, Esau and Jacob, were born (21-26), the former of whom seems to have been his favourite son (27,28).  </p><p> In consequence of a famine ( Genesis 26:1 ) Isaac went to Gerar, where he practised deception as to his relation to Rebekah, imitating the conduct of his father in Egypt ( 12:12-20 ) and in Gerar ( 20:2 ). The Philistine king rebuked him for his prevarication.  </p><p> After sojourning for some time in the land of the Philistines, he returned to Beersheba, where God gave him fresh assurance of covenant blessing, and where Abimelech entered into a covenant of peace with him. </p><p> The next chief event in his life was the blessing of his sons ( Genesis 27:1 ). He died at Mamre, "being old and full of days" ( 35:27-29 ), one hundred and eighty years old, and was buried in the cave of Machpelah.  </p><p> In the New Testament reference is made to his having been "offered up" by his father ( Hebrews 11:17 ;  James 2:21 ), and to his blessing his sons ( Hebrews 11:20 ). As the child of promise, he is contrasted with Ishmael ( Romans 9:7 Romans 9:10 ;  Galatians 4:28 ;  Hebrews 11:18 ).  </p><p> Isaac is "at once a counterpart of his father in simple devoutness and purity of life, and a contrast in his passive weakness of character, which in part, at least, may have sprung from his relations to his mother and wife. After the expulsion of Ishmael and Hagar, Isaac had no competitor, and grew up in the shade of Sarah's tent, moulded into feminine softness by habitual submission to her strong, loving will." His life was so quiet and uneventful that it was spent "within the circle of a few miles; so guileless that he let Jacob overreach him rather than disbelieve his assurance; so tender that his mother's death was the poignant sorrow of years; so patient and gentle that peace with his neighbours was dearer than even such a coveted possession as a well of living water dug by his own men; so grandly obedient that he put his life at his father's disposal; so firm in his reliance on God that his greatest concern through life was to honour the divine promise given to his race.", Geikie's Hours, etc. </p> </li>
Isaiah	<p>(Heb. Yesh'yahu, i.e., "the salvation of Jehovah"). </p><li> The son of Amoz ( Isaiah 1:1 ;  2:1 ), who was apparently a man of humble rank. His wife was called "the prophetess" ( 8:3 ), either because she was endowed with the prophetic gift, like Deborah (Judg.  4:4 ) and Huldah ( 2 Kings 22:14-20 ), or simply because she was the wife of "the prophet" ( Isaiah 38:1 ). He had two sons, who bore symbolical names.  <p> He exercised the functions of his office during the reigns of Uzziah (or Azariah), Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah ( 1:1 ). Uzziah reigned fifty-two years (B.C. 810-759), and Isaiah must have begun his career a few years before Uzziah's death, probably B.C. 762. He lived till the fourteenth year of Hezekiah, and in all likelihood outlived that monarch (who died B.C. 698), and may have been contemporary for some years with Manasseh. Thus Isaiah may have prophesied for the long period of at least sixty-four years.  </p><p> His first call to the prophetical office is not recorded. A second call came to him "in the year that King Uzziah died" ( Isaiah 6:1 ). He exercised his ministry in a spirit of uncompromising firmness and boldness in regard to all that bore on the interests of religion. He conceals nothing and keeps nothing back from fear of man. He was also noted for his spirituality and for his deep-toned reverence toward "the holy One of Israel."  </p><p> In early youth Isaiah must have been moved by the invasion of Israel by the Assyrian monarch Pul (q.v.),  2 Kings 15:19 ; and again, twenty years later, when he had already entered on his office, by the invasion of Tiglath-pileser and his career of conquest. Ahaz, king of Judah, at this crisis refused to co-operate with the kings of Israel and Syria in opposition to the Assyrians, and was on that account attacked and defeated by Rezin of Damascus and Pekah of Samaria ( 2 Kings 16:5 ;  2 Chr.  2 Kings 28:5  2 Kings 28:6 ). Ahaz, thus humbled, sided with Assyria, and sought the aid of Tiglath-pileser against Israel and Syria. The consequence was that Rezin and Pekah were conquered and many of the people carried captive to Assyria ( 2 Kings 15:29 ;  16:9 ;  1 Chronicles 5:26 ). Soon after this Shalmaneser determined wholly to subdue the kingdom of Israel. Samaria was taken and destroyed (B.C. 722). So long as Ahaz reigned, the kingdom of Judah was unmolested by the Assyrian power; but on his accession to the throne, Hezekiah (B.C. 726), who "rebelled against the king of Assyria" ( 2 Kings 18:7 ), in which he was encouraged by Isaiah, who exhorted the people to place all their dependence on Jehovah ( Isaiah 10:24 ;  37:6 ), entered into an alliance with the king of Egypt ( Isaiah 30:2-4 ). This led the king of Assyria to threaten the king of Judah, and at length to invade the land. Sennacherib (B.C. 701) led a powerful army into Palestine. Hezekiah was reduced to despair, and submitted to the Assyrians ( 2 Kings 18:14-16 ). But after a brief interval war broke out again, and again Sennacherib (q.v.) led an army into Palestine, one detachment of which threatened Jerusalem ( Isaiah 36:2-22 ;  37:8 ). Isaiah on that occasion encouraged Hezekiah to resist the Assyrians ( 37:1-7 ), whereupon Sennacherib sent a threatening letter to Hezekiah, which he "spread before the Lord" ( 37:14 ). The judgement of God now fell on the Assyrian host. "Like Xerxes in Greece, Sennacherib never recovered from the shock of the disaster in Judah. He made no more expeditions against either Southern Palestine or Egypt." The remaining years of Hezekiah's reign were peaceful ( 2 Chronicles 32:23 2 Chronicles 32:27-29 ). Isaiah probably lived to its close, and possibly into the reign of Manasseh, but the time and manner of his death are unknown. There is a tradition that he suffered martyrdom in the heathen reaction in the time of Manasseh (q.v.).  </p></li><li> One of the heads of the singers in the time of David ( 1 Chronicles 25:3 1 Chronicles 25:15 , "Jeshaiah").  </li><li> A Levite ( 1 Chronicles 26:25 ).  </li><li> Ezra 8:7 .  </li><li> Nehemiah 11:7 .   </li>
Isaiah, The Book of	<p>consists of prophecies delivered (Isa. 1) in the reign of Uzziah (1-5), (2) of Jotham (6), (3) Ahaz ( (7-14:28), ), (4) the first half of Hezekiah's reign ( 14:28-35 ), (5) the second half of Hezekiah's reign (36-66). Thus, counting from the fourth year before Uzziah's death (B.C. 762) to the last year of Hezekiah (B.C. 698), Isaiah's ministry extended over a period of sixty-four years. He may, however, have survived Hezekiah, and may have perished in the way indicated above.  </p><p> The book, as a whole, has been divided into three main parts: </p><li> The first thirty-five chapters, almost wholly prophetic, Israel's enemy Assyria, present the Messiah as a mighty Ruler and King. </li><li> Four chapters are historical (36-39), relating to the times of Hezekiah. </li><li> Prophetical (40-66), Israel's enemy Babylon, describing the Messiah as a suffering victim, meek and lowly.  <p> The genuineness of the section  Isaiah 4066 -66 has been keenly opposed by able critics. They assert that it must be the production of a deutero-Isaiah, who lived toward the close of the Babylonian captivity. This theory was originated by Koppe, a German writer at the close of the last century. There are other portions of the book also (e.g., ch. 13; 24-27; and certain verses in ch. 14 and 21) which they attribute to some other prophet than Isaiah. Thus they say that some five or seven, or even more, unknown prophets had a hand in the production of this book. The considerations which have led to such a result are various: </p></li><li> They cannot, as some say, conceive it possible that Isaiah, living in B.C. 700, could foretell the appearance and the exploits of a prince called Cyrus, who would set the Jews free from captivity one hundred and seventy years after. </li><li> It is alleged that the prophet takes the time of the Captivity as his standpoint, and speaks of it as then present; and (3) that there is such a difference between the style and language of the closing section (40-66) and those of the preceding chapters as to necessitate a different authorship, and lead to the conclusion that there were at least two Isaiahs. But even granting the fact of a great diversity of style and language, this will not necessitate the conclusion attempted to be drawn from it. The diversity of subjects treated of and the peculiarities of the prophet's position at the time the prophecies were uttered will sufficiently account for this.  <p> The arguments in favour of the unity of the book are quite conclusive. When the LXX. version was made (about B.C. 250) the entire contents of the book were ascribed to Isaiah, the son of Amoz. It is not called in question, moreover, that in the time of our Lord the book existed in the form in which we now have it. Many prophecies in the disputed portions are quoted in the New Testament as the words of Isaiah ( Matthew 3:3 ;  Luke 3:4-6 ;  4:16-41 ;  John 12:38 ;  Acts 8:28 ;  Romans 10:16-21 ). Universal and persistent tradition has ascribed the whole book to one author.  </p><p> Besides this, the internal evidence, the similarity in the language and style, in the thoughts and images and rhetorical ornaments, all points to the same conclusion; and its local colouring and allusions show that it is obviously of Palestinian origin. The theory therefore of a double authorship of the book, much less of a manifold authorship, cannot be maintained. The book, with all the diversity of its contents, is one, and is, we believe, the production of the great prophet whose name it bears. </p> </li>
Iscah	<p>spy, the daughter of Haran and sister of Milcah and Lot ( Genesis 11:29 Genesis 11:31 ).  </p>
Iscariot	<p>(See JUDAS .) </p>
Ishbak	<p>leaving, one of Abraham's sons by Keturah ( Genesis 25:2 ).  </p>
Ishbi-benob	<p>my seat at Nob, one of the Rephaim, whose spear was three hundred shekels in weight. He was slain by Abishai ( 2 Samuel 21:16 2 Samuel 21:17 ).  </p>
Ish-bosheth	<p>man of shame or humiliation, the youngest of Saul's four sons, and the only one who survived him ( 2 Samuel 24 -4). His name was originally Eshbaal ( 1 Chronicles 8:33 ;  9:39 ). He was about forty years of age when his father and three brothers fell at the battle of Gilboa. Through the influence of Abner, Saul's cousin, he was acknowledged as successor to the throne of Saul, and ruled over all Israel, except the tribe of Judah (over whom David was king), for two years, having Mahanaim, on the east of Jordan, as his capital ( 2 Samuel 2:9 ). After a troubled and uncertain reign he was murdered by his guard, who stabbed him while he was asleep on his couch at mid-day ( 2 Samuel 4:5-7 ); and having cut off his head, presented it to David, who sternly rebuked them for this cold-blooded murder, and ordered them to be immediately executed (9-12).  </p>
Ishi	<p>my husband, a symbolical name used in  Hosea 2:16  (See BAALI .) </p>
Ishmael	<p>God hears. </p><li> Abraham's eldest son, by Hagar the concubine ( Genesis 16:15 ;  17:23 ). He was born at Mamre, when Abraham was eighty-six years of age, eleven years after his arrival in Canaan ( 16:3 ;  21:5 ). At the age of thirteen he was circumcised ( 17:25 ). He grew up a true child of the desert, wild and wayward. On the occasion of the weaning of Isaac his rude and wayward spirit broke out in expressions of insult and mockery ( Genesis 21:9 Genesis 21:10 ); and Sarah, discovering this, said to Abraham, "Expel this slave and her son." Influenced by a divine admonition, Abraham dismissed Hagar and her son with no more than a skin of water and some bread. The narrative describing this act is one of the most beautiful and touching incidents of patriarchal life ( Genesis 21:14-16 ). (See HAGAR .) <p> Ishmael settled in the land of Paran, a region lying between Canaan and the mountains of Sinai; and "God was with him, and he became a great archer" ( Genesis 21:9-21 ). He became a great desert chief, but of his history little is recorded. He was about ninety years of age when his father Abraham died, in connection with whose burial he once more for a moment reappears. On this occasion the two brothers met after being long separated. "Isaac with his hundreds of household slaves, Ishmael with his troops of wild retainers and half-savage allies, in all the state of a Bedouin prince, gathered before the cave of Machpelah, in the midst of the men of Heth, to pay the last duties to the 'father of the faithful,' would make a notable subject for an artist" ( Genesis 25:9 ). Of the after events of his life but little is known. He died at the age of one hundred and thirty-seven years, but where and when are unknown ( 25:17 ). He had twelve sons, who became the founders of so many Arab tribes or colonies, the Ishmaelites, who spread over the wide desert spaces of Northern Arabia from the Red Sea to the Euphrates ( Genesis 37:25 Genesis 37:27 Genesis 37:28 ;  39:1 ), "their hand against every man, and every man's hand against them."  </p></li><li> The son of Nethaniah, "of the seed royal" ( Jeremiah 40:8 Jeremiah 40:15 ). He plotted against Gedaliah, and treacherously put him and others to death. He carried off many captives, "and departed to go over to the Ammonites."   </li>
Ishmaiah	<p>heard by Jehovah. </p><li> A Gibeonite who joined David at Ziklag, "a hero among the thirty and over the thirty" ( 1 Chronicles 12:4 ).  </li><li> Son of Obadiah, and viceroy of Zebulun under David and Solomon ( 1 Chronicles 27:19 ).   </li>
Ishmeelites	<p>( Genesis 37:28 ;  39:1 , A.V.) should be "Ishmaelites," as in the Revised Version.  </p>
Ishtob	<p>man of Tob, one of the small Syrian kingdoms which together constituted Aram ( 2 Samuel 10:6 2 Samuel 10:8 ).  </p>
Island	<p>(Heb. 'i, "dry land," as opposed to water) occurs in its usual signification ( Isaiah 42:4 Isaiah 42:10 Isaiah 42:12 Isaiah 42:15 , Compare  Jeremiah 47:4 ), but more frequently simply denotes a maritime region or sea-coast ( Isaiah 20:6 , RSV," coastland;"  Isaiah 23:2 Isaiah 23:6 ;  Jeremiah 2:10 ;  Ezekiel 27:6 Ezekiel 27:7 ). (See CHITTIM .) The shores of the Mediterranean are called the "islands of the sea" ( Isaiah 11:11 ), or the "isles of the Gentiles" ( Genesis 10:5 ), and sometimes simply "isles" ( Psalms 72:10 );  Ezekiel 26:15 Ezekiel 26:18 ;  Ezekiel 27:3 Ezekiel 27:35 ;  Daniel 11:18 ).  </p>
Israel	<p>the name conferred on Jacob after the great prayer-struggle at Peniel ( Genesis 32:28 ), because "as a prince he had power with God and prevailed." (See JACOB .) This is the common name given to Jacob's descendants. The whole people of the twelve tribes are called "Israelites," the "children of Israel" ( Joshua 3:17 ;  7:25 ;  Judges 8:27 ;  Jeremiah 3:21 ), and the "house of Israel" ( Exodus 16:31 ;  40:38 ).  </p><p> This name Israel is sometimes used emphatically for the true Israel ( Psalms 73:1 :  Isaiah 45:17 ;  49:3 ;  John 1:47 ;  Romans 9:6 ;  11:26 ).  </p><p> After the death of Saul the ten tribes arrogated to themselves this name, as if they were the whole nation ( 2 Samuel 2:9 2 Samuel 2:10 2 Samuel 2:17 2 Samuel 2:28 ;  2 Samuel 3:10 2 Samuel 3:17 ;  19:40-43 ), and the kings of the ten tribes were called "kings of Israel," while the kings of the two tribes were called "kings of Judah."  </p><p> After the Exile the name Israel was assumed as designating the entire nation. </p>
Israel, Kingdom of	<p>(B.C. 975-B.C. 722). Soon after the death of Solomon, Ahijah's prophecy ( 1 Kings 11:31-35 ) was fulfilled, and the kingdom was rent in twain. Rehoboam, the son and successor of Solomon, was scarcely seated on his throne when the old jealousies between Judah and the other tribes broke out anew, and Jeroboam was sent for from Egypt by the malcontents ( 1 Kings 12:2 1 Kings 12:3 ). Rehoboam insolently refused to lighten the burdensome taxation and services which his father had imposed on his subjects ( 12:4 ), and the rebellion became complete. Ephraim and all Israel raised the old cry, "Every man to his tents, O Israel" ( 2 Samuel 20:1 ). Rehoboam fled to Jerusalem ( 1 Kings 12:1-18 ;  2 Chr.  10 ), and Jeroboam was proclaimed king over all Israel at Shechem, Judah and Benjamin remaining faithful to Solomon's son. War, with varying success, was carried on between the two kingdoms for about sixty years, till Jehoshaphat entered into an alliance with the house of Ahab.  </p><p> Extent of the kingdom. In the time of Solomon the area of Palestine, excluding the Phoenician territories on the shore of the Mediterranean, did not much exceed 13,000 square miles. The kingdom of Israel comprehended about 9,375 square miles. Shechem was the first capital of this kingdom ( 1 Kings 12:25 ), afterwards Tirza ( 14:17 ). Samaria was subsequently chosen as the capital ( 16:24 ), and continued to be so till the destruction of the kingdom by the Assyrians ( 2 Kings 17:5 ). During the siege of Samaria (which lasted for three years) by the Assyrians, Shalmaneser died and was succeeded by Sargon, who himself thus records the capture of that city: "Samaria I looked at, I captured; 27,280 men who dwelt in it I carried away" ( 2 Kings 17:6 ) into Assyria. Thus after a duration of two hundred and fifty-three years the kingdom of the ten tribes came to an end. They were scattered throughout the East. (See CAPTIVITY .) </p><p> "Judah held its ground against Assyria for yet one hundred and twenty-three years, and became the rallying-point of the dispersed of every tribe, and eventually gave its name to the whole race. Those of the people who in the last struggle escaped into the territories of Judah or other neighbouring countries naturally looked to Judah as the head and home of their race. And when Judah itself was carried off to Babylon, many of the exiled Israelites joined them from Assyria, and swelled that immense population which made Babylonia a second Palestine." </p><p> After the deportation of the ten tribes, the deserted land was colonized by various eastern tribes, whom the king of Assyria sent thither ( Ezra 4:2 Ezra 4:10 ;  2 Kings  <span class="badLink">17:24-29</span> ). (See KINGS .) </p><p> In contrast with the kingdom of Judah is that of Israel. </p><li> "There was no fixed capital and no religious centre. </li><li> The army was often insubordinate. </li><li> The succession was constantly interrupted, so that out of nineteen kings there were no less than nine dynasties, each ushered in by a revolution. </li><li> The authorized priests left the kingdom in a body, and the priesthood established by Jeroboam had no divine sanction and no promise; it was corrupt at its very source." (Maclean's O. T. Hist.)   </li>
Issachar	<p>hired ( Genesis 30:18 ). "God hath given me," said Leah, "my hire (Heb. sekhari)...and she called his name Issachar." He was Jacob's ninth son, and was born in Padan-aram (comp  28:2 ). He had four sons at the going down into Egypt ( 46:13 ;  Numbers 26:23 Numbers 26:25 ).  </p><p> Issachar, Tribe of, during the journey through the wilderness, along with Judah and Zebulun ( Numbers 2:5 ), marched on the east of the tabernacle. This tribe contained 54,400 fighting men when the census was taken at Sinai. After the entrance into the Promised Land, this tribe was one of the six which stood on Gerizim during the ceremony of the blessing and cursing ( Deuteronomy 27:12 ). The allotment of Issachar is described in  Joshua 19:17-23 . It included the plain of Esdraelon (=Jezreel), which was and still is the richest portion of Palestine ( Deuteronomy 33:18 Deuteronomy 33:19 ;  1 Chronicles 12:40 ).  </p><p> The prophetic blessing pronounced by Jacob on Issachar corresponds with that of Moses ( Genesis 49:14 Genesis 49:15 ; Compare  Deuteronomy 33:18 Deuteronomy 33:19 ).  </p>
Italian band	<p>the name of the Roman cohort to which Cornelius belonged ( Acts 10:1 ), so called probably because it consisted of men recruited in Italy.  </p>
Italy	<p> Acts 18:2 ;  Acts 27:1 Acts 27:6 ;  Hebrews 13:24 ), like most geographical names, was differently used at different periods of history. As the power of Rome advanced, nations were successively conquered and added to it till it came to designate the whole country to the south of the Alps. There was constant intercourse between Palestine and Italy in the time of the Romans.  </p>
Ithamar	<p>palm isle, the fourth and youngest son of Aaron ( 1 Chronicles 6:3 ). He was consecrated to the priesthood along with his brothers ( Exodus 6:23 ); and after the death of Nadab and Abihu, he and Eleazar alone discharged the functions of that office ( Leviticus 10:6 Leviticus 10:12 ;  Numbers 3:4 ). He and his family occupied the position of common priest till the high priesthood passed into his family in the person of Eli ( 1 Kings 2:27 ), the reasons for which are not recorded. (See ZADOK .) </p>
Ithrite	<p>two of David's warriors so designated ( 2 Samuel 23:38 ;  1 Chronicles 11:40 ).  </p>
Ittai	<p>near; timely; or, with the Lord. </p><li> A Benjamite, one of David's thirty heroes ( 2 Samuel 23:29 ).  </li><li> A native of Gath, a Philistine, who had apparently the command of the six hundred heroes who formed David's band during his wanderings ( 2 Samuel 15:19-22 ; Compare  1 Samuel 23:13 ;  27:2 ;  1 Samuel 30:9 1 Samuel 30:10 ). He is afterwards with David at Mahanaim, holding in the army equal rank with Joab and Abishai ( 2 Samuel 18:2 2 Samuel 18:5 2 Samuel 18:12 ). He then passes from view.   </li>
Ituraea	<p>a district in the north-east of Palestine, forming, along with the adjacent territory of Trachonitis, the tetrarchy of Philip ( Luke 3:1 ). The present Jedur comprehends the chief part of Ituraea. It is bounded on the east by Trachonitis, on the south by Gaulanitis, on the west by Hermon, and on the north by the plain of Damascus.  </p>
Ivah	<p>overturning, a city of the Assyrians, whence colonists were brought to Samaria ( 2 Kings 18:34 ;  19:13 ). It lay on the Euphrates, between Sepharvaim and Henah, and is supposed by some to have been the Ahava of ( Ezra 8:15 ).  </p>
Ivory	<p>(Heb. pl. shenhabbim, the "tusks of elephants") was early used in decorations by the Egyptians, and a great trade in it was carried on by the Assyrians ( Ezekiel 27:6 ;  Revelation 18:12 ). It was used by the Phoenicians to ornament the box-wood rowing-benches of their galleys, and Hiram's skilled workmen made Solomon's throne of ivory ( 1 Kings 10:18 ). It was brought by the caravans of Dedan ( Isaiah 21:13 ), and from the East Indies by the navy of Tarshish ( 1 Kings 10:22 ). Many specimens of ancient Egyptian and Assyrian ivory-work have been preserved. The word <i> habbim</i> is derived from the Sanscrit <i> ibhas</i> , meaning "elephant," preceded by the Hebrew article (ha); and hence it is argued that Ophir, from which it and the other articles mentioned in  1 Kings 10:22  were brought, was in India.  </p>
Izhar	<p>oil, one of the sons of Kohath, and grandson of Levi ( Exodus 6:18 Exodus 6:21 ;  Numbers 16:1 ).  </p>
Izrahite	<p>the designation of one of David's officers ( 1 Chronicles 27:8 ).  </p>
Jericho	<p>place of fragrance, a fenced city in the midst of a vast grove of palm trees, in the plain of Jordan, over against the place where that river was crossed by the Israelites ( Joshua 3:16 ). Its site was near the 'Ain es-Sultan, Elisha's Fountain ( 2 Kings 2:19-22 ), about 5 miles west of Jordan. It was the most important city in the Jordan valley ( Numbers 22:1 ;  34:15 ), and the strongest fortress in all the land of Canaan. It was the key to Western Palestine.  </p><p> This city was taken in a very remarkable manner by the Israelites ( Joshua 6 ). God gave it into their hands. The city was "accursed" (Heb. herem, "devoted" to Jehovah), and accordingly ( Joshua 6:17 ; Compare  Leviticus 27:28 Leviticus 27:29 ;  Deuteronomy 13:16 ) all the inhabitants and all the spoil of the city were to be destroyed, "only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron" were reserved and "put into the treasury of the house of Jehovah" ( Joshua 6:24 ; Compare  Numbers 31:22 Numbers 31:23 Numbers 31:50-54 ). Only Rahab "and her father's household, and all that she had," were preserved from destruction, according to the promise of the spies ( Joshua 2:14 ). In one of the Amarna tablets Adoni-zedec (q.v.) writes to the king of Egypt informing him that the 'Abiri (Hebrews) had prevailed, and had taken the fortress of Jericho, and were plundering "all the king's lands." It would seem that the Egyptian troops had before this been withdrawn from Palestine.  </p><p> This city was given to the tribe of Benjamin ( Joshua 18:21 ), and it was inhabited in the time of the Judges ( Judges 3:13 ;  2 Sam  10:5 ). It is not again mentioned till the time of David ( 2 Samuel 10:5 ). "Children of Jericho" were among the captives who returned under Zerubbabel  Ezra 2:34 ;  Nehemiah 7:36 ). Hiel (q.v.) the Bethelite attempted to make it once more a fortified city ( 1 Kings 16:34 ). Between the beginning and the end of his undertaking all his children were cut off.  </p><p> In New Testament times Jericho stood some distance to the south-east of the ancient one, and near the opening of the valley of Achor. It was a rich and flourishing town, having a considerable trade, and celebrated for the palm trees which adorned the plain around. It was visited by our Lord on his last journey to Jerusalem. Here he gave sight to two blind men ( Matthew 20:29-34 ;  Mark 10:46-52 ), and brought salvation to the house of Zacchaeus the publican ( Luke 19:2-10 ).  </p><p> The poor hamlet of er-Riha, the representative of modern Jericho, is situated some two miles farther to the east. It is in a ruinous condition, having been destroyed by the Turks in 1840. "The soil of the plain," about the middle of which the ancient city stood, "is unsurpassed in fertility; there is abundance of water for irrigation, and many of the old aqueducts are almost perfect; yet nearly the whole plain is waste and desolate...The climate of Jericho is exceedingly hot and unhealthy. This is accounted for by the depression of the plain, which is about 1,200 feet below the level of the sea."  </p><p> There were three different Jerichos, on three different sites, the Jericho of Joshua, the Jericho of Herod, and the Jericho of the Crusades. Er-Riha, the modern Jericho, dates from the time of the Crusades. Dr. Bliss has found in a hollow scooped out for some purpose or other near the foot of the biggest mound above the Sultan's Spring specimens of Amorite or pre-Israelitish pottery precisely identical with what he had discovered on the site of ancient Lachish. He also traced in this place for a short distance a mud brick wall in situ, which he supposes to be the very wall that fell before the trumpets of Joshua. The wall is not far from the foot of the great precipice of Quarantania and its numerous caverns, and the spies of Joshua could easily have fled from the city and been speedily hidden in these fastnesses. </p>
Jerimoth	<p>heights. </p><li> One of the sons of Bela ( 1 Chronicles 7:7 ).  </li><li> 1 Chronicles 24:30 , a Merarite Levite.  </li><li> A Benjamite slinger who joined David at Ziklag ( 1 Chronicles 12:5 ).  </li><li> A Levitical musician under Heman his father ( 1 Chronicles 25:4 ).  </li><li> 1 Chronicles 27:19 , ruler of Naphtali.  </li><li> One of David's sons ( 2 Chronicles 11:18 ).  </li><li> A Levite, one of the overseers of the temple offerings ( 2 Chronicles 31:13 ) in the reign of Hezekiah.   </li>
Jeroboam	<p>increase of the people. </p><li> The son of Nebat ( 1 Kings 11:26-39 ), "an Ephrathite," the first king of the ten tribes, over whom he reigned twenty-two years (B.C. 976-945). He was the son of a widow of Zereda, and while still young was promoted by Solomon to be chief superintendent of the "burnden", i.e., of the bands of forced labourers. Influenced by the words of the prophet Ahijah, he began to form conspiracies with the view of becoming king of the ten tribes; but these having been discovered, he fled to Egypt ( 1 Kings 11:29-40 ), where he remained for a length of time under the protection of Shishak I. On the death of Solomon, the ten tribes, having revolted, sent to invite him to become their king. The conduct of Rehoboam favoured the designs of Jeroboam, and he was accordingly proclaimed "king of Israel" ( 1 Kings 12: : 1-20). He rebuilt and fortified Shechem as the capital of his kingdom. He at once adopted means to perpetuate the division thus made between the two parts of the kingdom, and erected at Dan and Bethel, the two extremities of his kingdom, "golden calves," which he set up as symbols of Jehovah, enjoining the people not any more to go up to worship at Jerusalem, but to bring their offerings to the shrines he had erected. Thus he became distinguished as the man "who made Israel to sin." This policy was followed by all the succeeding kings of Israel.  <p> While he was engaged in offering incense at Bethel, a prophet from Judah appeared before him with a warning message from the Lord. Attempting to arrest the prophet for his bold words of defiance, his hand was "dried up," and the altar before which he stood was rent asunder. At his urgent entreaty his "hand was restored him again" ( 1 Kings 13:1-6 1 Kings 13:9 ; Compare  2 Kings 23:15 ); but the miracle made no abiding impression on him. His reign was one of constant war with the house of Judah. He died soon after his son Abijah ( 1 Kings 14:1-18 ).  </p></li><li> Jeroboam II., the son and successor of Jehoash, and the fourteenth king of Israel, over which he ruled for forty-one years, B.C. 825-784 ( 2 Kings 14:23 ). He followed the example of the first Jeroboam in keeping up the worship of the golden calves ( 2 Kings 14:24 ). His reign was contemporary with those of Amaziah ( 2 Kings 14:23 ) and Uzziah ( 15:1 ), kings of Judah. He was victorious over the Syrians ( 13:4 ;  2 Kings 14:26 2 Kings 14:27 ), and extended Israel to its former limits, from "the entering of Hamath to the sea of the plain" ( 14:25 ;  Amos 6:14 ). His reign of forty-one years was the most prosperous that Israel had ever known as yet. With all this outward prosperity, however, iniquity widely prevailed in the land ( Amos 2:6-8 ;  4:1 ;  6:6 ;  Hosea 4:12-14 ). The prophets ( Hosea 1:1 ), ( Joel 3:16 ;  Amos 1:1 Amos 1:2 ), ( Amos 1:1 ), and Jonah ( 2 Kings 14:25 ) lived during his reign. He died, and was buried with his ancestors ( 14:29 ). He was succeeded by his son Zachariah (q.v.).  <p> His name occurs in Scripture only in  2 Kings 13:13 ;  2 Kings 14:16 2 Kings 14:23 2 Kings 14:27 2 Kings 14:28 2 Kings 14:29 ;  2 Kings 15:1 2 Kings 15:8 ;  1 Chronicles 5:17 ;  Hosea 1:1 ;  Amos 1:1 ;  Amos 7:9 Amos 7:10 Amos 7:11 . In all other passages it is Jeroboam the son of Nebat that is meant.  </p> </li>
Jeroham	<p>cherished; who finds mercy. </p><li> Father of Elkanah, and grandfather of the prophet Samuel ( 1 Samuel 1:1 ).  </li><li> The father of Azareel, the "captain" of the tribe of Dan ( 1 Chronicles 27:22 ).  </li><li> 1 Chronicles 12:7 ; a Benjamite.  </li><li> 2 Chronicles 23:1 ; one whose son assisted in placing Joash on the throne.  </li><li> 1 Chronicles 9:8 ; a Benjamite.  </li><li> 1 Chronicles 9:12 ; a priest, perhaps the same as in  Nehemiah 11:12 .   </li>
Jerubbaal	<p>contender with Baal; or, let Baal plead, a surname of Gideon; a name given to him because he destroyed the altar of Baal (Judg.  <span class="badLink">6:32</span> ;  7:1 ;  <span class="badLink">8:29</span> ;  1 Samuel 12:11 ).  </p>
Jerubbesheth	<p>contender with the shame; i.e., idol, a surname also of Gideon ( 2 Samuel 11:21 ).  </p>
Jeruel	<p>founded by God, a "desert" on the ascent from the valley of the Dead Sea towards Jerusalem. It lay beyond the wilderness of Tekoa, in the direction of Engedi ( 2 Chronicles 20:16 2 Chronicles 20:20 ). It corresponds with the tract of country now called el-Hasasah.  </p>
Jerusalem	<p>called also Salem, Ariel, Jebus, the "city of God," the "holy city;" by the modern Arabs el-Khuds, meaning "the holy;" once "the city of Judah" ( 2 Chronicles 25:28 ). This name is in the original in the dual form, and means "possession of peace," or "foundation of peace." The dual form probably refers to the two mountains on which it was built, viz., Zion and Moriah; or, as some suppose, to the two parts of the city, the "upper" and the "lower city." Jerusalem is a "mountain city enthroned on a mountain fastness" (Compare  Psalms 68:15 Psalms 68:16 ;  87:1 ;  125:2 ;  Psalms 76:1 Psalms 76:2 ;  122:3 ). It stands on the edge of one of the highest table-lands in Palestine, and is surrounded on the south-eastern, the southern, and the western sides by deep and precipitous ravines.  </p><p> It is first mentioned in Scripture under the name Salem ( Genesis 14:18 ; Compare  Psalms 76:2 ). When first mentioned under the name Jerusalem, Adonizedek was its king ( Joshua 10:1 ). It is afterwards named among the cities of Benjamin ( Judges 19:10 ;  1 Chronicles 11:4 ); but in the time of David it was divided between Benjamin and Judah. After the death of Joshua the city was taken and set on fire by the men of Judah ( Judges 1:1-8 ); but the Jebusites were not wholly driven out of it. The city is not again mentioned till we are told that David brought the head of Goliath thither ( 1 Samuel 17:54 ). David afterwards led his forces against the Jebusites still residing within its walls, and drove them out, fixing his own dwelling on Zion, which he called "the city of David" ( 2 Samuel 5:5-9 ;  1 Chronicles 11:4-8 ). Here he built an altar to the Lord on the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite ( 2 Samuel 24:15-25 ), and thither he brought up the ark of the covenant and placed it in the new tabernacle which he had prepared for it. Jerusalem now became the capital of the kingdom.  </p><p> After the death of David, Solomon built the temple, a house for the name of the Lord, on Mount Moriah (B.C. 1010). He also greatly strengthened and adorned the city, and it became the great centre of all the civil and religious affairs of the nation ( Deuteronomy 12:5 ; comp  12:14 ;  14:23 ;  16:11-16 ;  Psalms 122 ).  </p><p> After the disruption of the kingdom on the accession to the throne of Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, Jerusalem became the capital of the kingdom of the two tribes. It was subsequently often taken and retaken by the Egyptians, the Assyrians, and by the kings of Israel ( 2 Kings 14:13 2 Kings 14:14 ;  2 Kings 18:15 2 Kings 18:16 ;  23:33-35 ;  24:14 ;  2 Chr  12:9 ;  <span class="badLink">26:9</span> ;  <span class="badLink">2 Kings 27:3</span> <span class="badLink">2 Kings 27:4</span> ;  <span class="badLink">29:3</span> ;  <span class="badLink">32:30</span> ;  <span class="badLink">33:11</span> ), till finally, for the abounding iniquities of the nation, after a siege of three years, it was taken and utterly destroyed, its walls razed to the ground, and its temple and palaces consumed by fire, by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon ( 2 Kings 25 ;  2 Chr.  <span class="badLink">36</span> ;  Jeremiah 39 ), B.C. 588. The desolation of the city and the land was completed by the retreat of the principal Jews into Egypt ( <span class="badLink">Jeremiah 4044</span> -44), and by the final carrying captive into Babylon of all that still remained in the land ( 52:3 ), so that it was left without an inhabitant (B.C. 582). Compare the predictions,  Deuteronomy 28 ;  Leviticus 26:14-39 .  </p><p> But the streets and walls of Jerusalem were again to be built, in troublous times ( Daniel 9:16 Daniel 9:19 Daniel 9:25 ), after a captivity of seventy years. This restoration was begun B.C. 536, "in the first year of Cyrus" ( Ezra 1:2 Ezra 1:3 Ezra 1:5-11 ). The Books of Ezra and Nehemiah contain the history of the re-building of the city and temple, and the restoration of the kingdom of the Jews, consisting of a portion of all the tribes. The kingdom thus constituted was for two centuries under the dominion of Persia, till B.C. 331; and thereafter, for about a century and a half, under the rulers of the Greek empire in Asia, till B.C. 167. For a century the Jews maintained their independence under native rulers, the Asmonean princes. At the close of this period they fell under the rule of Herod and of members of his family, but practically under Rome, till the time of the destruction of Jerusalem, A.D. 70. The city was then laid in ruins.  </p><p> The modern Jerusalem by-and-by began to be built over the immense beds of rubbish resulting from the overthrow of the ancient city; and whilst it occupies certainly the same site, there are no evidences that even the lines of its streets are now what they were in the ancient city. Till A.D. 131 the Jews who still lingered about Jerusalem quietly submitted to the Roman sway. But in that year the emperor (Hadrian), in order to hold them in subjection, rebuilt and fortified the city. The Jews, however, took possession of it, having risen under the leadership of one Bar-Chohaba (i.e., "the son of the star") in revolt against the Romans. Some four years afterwards (A.D. 135), however, they were driven out of it with great slaughter, and the city was again destroyed; and over its ruins was built a Roman city called Aelia Capitolina, a name which it retained till it fell under the dominion of the Mohammedans, when it was called el-Khuds, i.e., "the holy."  </p><p> In A.D. 326 Helena, mother of the emperor Constantine, made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem with the view of discovering the places mentioned in the life of our Lord. She caused a church to be built on what was then supposed to be the place of the nativity at Bethlehem. Constantine, animated by her example, searched for the holy sepulchre, and built over the supposed site a magnificent church, which was completed and dedicated A.D. 335. He relaxed the laws against the Jews till this time in force, and permitted them once a year to visit the city and wail over the desolation of "the holy and beautiful house."  </p><p> In A.D. 614 the Persians, after defeating the Roman forces of the emperor Heraclius, took Jerusalem by storm, and retained it till A.D. 637, when it was taken by the Arabians under the Khalif Omar. It remained in their possession till it passed, in A.D. 960, under the dominion of the Fatimite khalifs of Egypt, and in A.D. 1073 under the Turcomans. In A.D. 1099 the crusader Godfrey of Bouillon took the city from the Moslems with great slaughter, and was elected king of Jerusalem. He converted the Mosque of Omar into a Christian cathedral. During the eighty-eight years which followed, many churches and convents were erected in the holy city. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was rebuilt during this period, and it alone remains to this day. In A.D. 1187 the sultan Saladin wrested the city from the Christians. From that time to the present day, with few intervals, Jerusalem has remained in the hands of the Moslems. It has, however, during that period been again and again taken and retaken, demolished in great part and rebuilt, no city in the world having passed through so many vicissitudes.  </p><p> In the year 1850 the Greek and Latin monks residing in Jerusalem had a fierce dispute about the guardianship of what are called the "holy places." In this dispute the emperor Nicholas of Russia sided with the Greeks, and Louis Napoleon, the emperor of the French, with the Latins. This led the Turkish authorities to settle the question in a way unsatisfactory to Russia. Out of this there sprang the Crimean War, which was protracted and sanguinary, but which had important consequences in the way of breaking down the barriers of Turkish exclusiveness.  </p><p> Modern Jerusalem "lies near the summit of a broad mountain-ridge, which extends without interruption from the plain of Esdraelon to a line drawn between the southern end of the Dead Sea and the southeastern corner of the Mediterranean." This high, uneven table-land is everywhere from 20 to 25 geographical miles in breadth. It was anciently known as the mountains of Ephraim and Judah.  </p><p> "Jerusalem is a city of contrasts, and differs widely from Damascus, not merely because it is a stone town in mountains, whilst the latter is a mud city in a plain, but because while in Damascus Moslem religion and Oriental custom are unmixed with any foreign element, in Jerusalem every form of religion, every nationality of East and West, is represented at one time." </p><p> Jerusalem is first mentioned under that name in the Book of Joshua, and the Tell-el-Amarna collection of tablets includes six letters from its Amorite king to Egypt, recording the attack of the Abiri about B.C. 1480. The name is there spelt Uru-Salim ("city of peace"). Another monumental record in which the Holy City is named is that of Sennacherib's attack in B.C. 702. The "camp of the Assyrians" was still shown about A.D. 70, on the flat ground to the north-west, included in the new quarter of the city.  </p><p> The city of David included both the upper city and Millo, and was surrounded by a wall built by David and Solomon, who appear to have restored the original Jebusite fortifications. The name Zion (or Sion) appears to have been, like Ariel ("the hearth of God"), a poetical term for Jerusalem, but in the Greek age was more specially used of the Temple hill. The priests' quarter grew up on Ophel, south of the Temple, where also was Solomon's Palace outside the original city of David. The walls of the city were extended by Jotham and Manasseh to include this suburb and the Temple ( 2 Chronicles 27:3 ;  33:14 ).  </p><p> Jerusalem is now a town of some 50,000 inhabitants, with ancient mediaeval walls, partly on the old lines, but extending less far to the south. The traditional sites, as a rule, were first shown in the 4th and later centuries A.D., and have no authority. The results of excavation have, however, settled most of the disputed questions, the limits of the Temple area, and the course of the old walls having been traced.  </p>
Jerusha	<p>possession, or possessed; i.e., "by a husband", the wife of Uzziah, and mother of king Jotham ( 2 Kings 15:33 ).  </p>
Jeshaiah	<p>deliverance of Jehovah. </p><li> A Kohathite Levite, the father of Joram, of the family of Eliezer ( 1 Chronicles 26:25 ); called also Isshiah ( 24:21 ).  </li><li> One of the sons of Jeduthum ( 1 Chronicles 25:3 1 Chronicles 25:15 ).  </li><li> One of the three sons of Hananiah ( 1 Chronicles 3:21 ).  </li><li> Son of Athaliah ( Ezra 8:7 ).  </li><li> A Levite of the family of Merari ( 8:19 ).   </li>

Jesher	<p>uprightness, the first of the three sons of Caleb by Azubah ( 1 Chronicles 2:18 ).  </p>
Jeshimon	<p>the waste, probably some high waste land to the south of the Dead Sea ( Numbers 21:20 ;  23:28 ;  1 Samuel 23:19 1 Samuel 23:24 ); or rather not a proper name at all, but simply "the waste" or "wilderness," the district on which the plateau of Ziph (q.v.) looks down.  </p>
Jeshua	<p></p><li> Head of the ninth priestly order ( Ezra 2:36 ); called also Jeshuah ( 1 Chronicles 24:11 ).  </li><li> A Levite appointed by Hezekiah to distribute offerings in the priestly cities ( 2 Chronicles 31:15 ).  </li><li> Ezra 2:6 ;  Nehemiah 7:11 .  </li><li> Ezra 2:40 ;  Nehemiah 7:43 .  </li><li> The son of Jozadak, and high priest of the Jews under Zerubbabel ( Nehemiah 7:7 ;  Nehemiah 12:1 Nehemiah 12:7 Nehemiah 12:10 Nehemiah 12:26 ); called Joshua ( Haggai 1:1 Haggai 1:12 ;  Haggai 2:2 Haggai 2:4 ;  Zechariah 3:1 Zechariah 3:3 Zechariah 3:6 Zechariah 3:8 Zechariah 3:9 ).  </li><li> A Levite ( Ezra 8:33 ).  </li><li> Nehemiah 3:19 .  </li><li> A Levite who assisted in the reformation under ( Nehemiah 8:7 ;  Nehemiah 9:4 Nehemiah 9:5 ).  </li><li> Son of Kadmiel ( Nehemiah 12:24 ).  </li><li> A city of Judah ( Nehemiah 11:26 ).  </li><li> Nehemiah 8:17 ; Joshua, the son of Nun.   </li>
Jeshurun	<p>a poetical name for the people of Israel, used in token of affection, meaning, "the dear upright people" ( Deuteronomy 32:15 ;  Deuteronomy 33:5 Deuteronomy 33:26 ;  Isaiah 44:2 ).  </p>
Jesse	<p>firm, or a gift, a son of Obed, the son of Boaz and Ruth ( Ruth 4:17 Ruth 4:22 ;  Matthew 1:5 Matthew 1:6 ;  Luke 3:32 ). He was the father of eight sons, the youngest of whom was David ( 1 Samuel 17:12 ). The phrase "stem of Jesse" is used for the family of David ( Isaiah 11:1 ), and "root of Jesse" for the Messiah ( Isaiah 11:10 ;  Revelation 5:5 ). Jesse was a man apparently of wealth and position at Bethlehem ( 1 Samuel 17:17 1 Samuel 17:18 1 Samuel 17:20 ;  Psalms 78:71 ). The last reference to him is of David's procuring for him an asylum with the king of Moab ( 1 Samuel 22:3 ).  </p>
Jesus	<p></p><li> Joshua, the son of Nun ( Acts 7:45 ;  Hebrews 4:8 ; RSV, "Joshua").  </li><li> A Jewish Christian surnamed Justus ( Colossians 4:11 ).  <p> Je'sus, the proper, as Christ is the official, name of our Lord. To distinguish him from others so called, he is spoken of as "Jesus of Nazareth" ( John 18:7 ), and "Jesus the son of Joseph" ( John 6:42 ).  </p><p> This is the Greek form of the Hebrew name Joshua, which was originally Hoshea ( Numbers 13:8 Numbers 13:16 ), but changed by Moses into Jehoshua ( Numbers 13:16 ;  1 Chronicles 7:27 ), or Joshua. After the Exile it assumed the form Jeshua, whence the Greek form Jesus. It was given to our Lord to denote the object of his mission, to save ( Matthew 1:21 ).  </p><p> The life of Jesus on earth may be divided into two great periods, (1) that of his private life, till he was about thirty years of age; and (2) that of his public life, which lasted about three years.  </p><p> In the "fulness of time" he was born at Bethlehem, in the reign of the emperor Augustus, of Mary, who was betrothed to Joseph, a carpenter ( Matthew 1:1 ;  Luke 3:23 ; Compare  John 7:42 ). His birth was announced to the shepherds ( Luke 2:8-20 ). Wise men from the east came to Bethlehem to see him who was born "King of the Jews," bringing gifts with them ( Matthew 2:1-12 ). Herod's cruel jealousy led to Joseph's flight into Egypt with Mary and the infant Jesus, where they tarried till the death of this king ( Matthew 2:13-23 ), when they returned and settled in Nazareth, in Lower Galilee ( 2:23 ; Compare  Luke 4:16 ;  John 1:46 , etc.). At the age of twelve years he went up to Jerusalem to the Passover with his parents. There, in the temple, "in the midst of the doctors," all that heard him were "astonished at his understanding and answers" ( Luke 2:41 , etc.).  </p><p> Eighteen years pass, of which we have no record beyond this, that he returned to Nazareth and "increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man" ( Luke 2:52 ).  </p><p> He entered on his public ministry when he was about thirty years of age. It is generally reckoned to have extended to about three years. "Each of these years had peculiar features of its own. </p></li><li> The first year may be called the year of obscurity, both because the records of it which we possess are very scanty, and because he seems during it to have been only slowly emerging into public notice. It was spent for the most part in Judea. </li><li> The second year was the year of public favour, during which the country had become thoroughly aware of him; his activity was incessant, and his frame rang through the length and breadth of the land. It was almost wholly passed in Galilee. </li><li> The third was the year of opposition, when the public favour ebbed away. His enemies multiplied and assailed him with more and more pertinacity, and at last he fell a victim to their hatred. The first six months of this final year were passed in Galilee, and the last six in other parts of the land.", Stalker's Life of Jesus Christ, p. 45.  <p> The only reliable sources of information regarding the life of Christ on earth are the Gospels, which present in historical detail the words and the work of Christ in so many different aspects.

Jether	<p>surplus; excellence. </p><li> Father-in-law of Moses ( Exodus 4:18  marg.), called elsewhere Jethro (q.v.).  </li><li> The oldest of Gideon's seventy sons ( Judges 8:20 ).  </li><li> The father of Amasa, David's general ( 1 Kings 2:5 1 Kings 2:32 ); called Ithra ( 2 Samuel 17:25 ).  </li><li> 1 Chronicles 7:38 .  </li><li> 1 Chronicles 2:32 ; one of Judah's posterity.  </li><li> 1 Chronicles 4:17 .   </li>
Jetheth	<p>a peg, or a prince, one of the Edomitish kings of Mount Seir ( Genesis 36:40 ).  </p>
Jethlah	<p>suspended; high, a city on the borders of Dan ( Joshua 19:42 ).  </p>
Jethro	<p>his excellence, or gain, a prince or priest of Midian, who succeeded his father Reuel. Moses spent forty years after his exile from the Egyptian court as keeper of Jethro's flocks. While the Israelites were encamped at Sinai, and soon after their victory over Amalek, Jethro came to meet Moses, bringing with him Zipporah and her two sons. They met at the "mount of God," and "Moses told him all that the Lord had done unto Pharaoh" ( Exodus 18:8 ). On the following day Jethro, observing the multiplicity of the duties devolving on Moses, advised him to appoint subordinate judges, rulers of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens, to decide smaller matters, leaving only the weightier matters to be referred to Moses, to be laid before the Lord. This advice Moses adopted ( Exodus 18 ). He was also called Hobab (q.v.), which was probably his personal name, while Jethro was an official name. (See MOSES .) </p>
Jetur	<p>an enclosure, one of the twelve sons of Ishmael ( Genesis 25:15 ).  </p>
Jeuel	<p>snatched away by God, a descendant of Zerah ( 1 Chronicles 9:6 ).  </p>
Jeush	<p>assembler. </p><li> The oldest of Esau's three sons by Aholibamah ( Genesis 36:5 Genesis 36:14 Genesis 36:18 ).  </li><li> A son of Bilhan, grandson of Benjamin ( 1 Chronicles 7:10 ).  </li><li> A Levite, one of the sons of Shimei ( 1 Chronicles 23:10 1 Chronicles 23:11 ).  </li><li> One of the three sons of Rehoboam ( 2 Chronicles 11:19 ).  </li><li> 1 Chronicles 8:39 .   </li>
Jew	<p>the name derived from the patriarch Judah, at first given to one belonging to the tribe of Judah or to the separate kingdom of Judah ( 2 Kings 16:6 ;  25:25 ;  Jeremiah 32:12 ;  38:19 ;  40:11 ;  41:3 ), in contradistinction from those belonging to the kingdom of the ten tribes, who were called Israelites.  </p><p> During the Captivity, and after the Restoration, the name, however, was extended to all the Hebrew nation without distinction ( Esther 3:6 Esther 3:10 ;  Daniel 3:8 Daniel 3:12 ;  Ezra 4:12 ;  Ezra 5:1 Ezra 5:5 ).  </p><p> Originally this people were called Hebrews ( Genesis 39:14 ;  40:15 ;  Exodus 2:7 ;  3:18 ;  5:3 ;  1 Samuel 4:6 1 Samuel 4:9 , etc.), but after the Exile this name fell into disuse. But Paul was styled a Hebrew ( 2 Corinthians 11:22 ; Phil  3:5 ).  </p><p> The history of the Jewish nation is interwoven with the history of Palestine and with the narratives of the lives of their rulers and chief men. They are now [1897] dispersed over all lands, and to this day remain a separate people, "without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image [RSV 'pillar,' marg. 'obelisk'], and without an ephod, and without teraphim" ( Hosea 3:4 ). Till about the beginning of the present century [1800] they were everywhere greatly oppressed, and often cruelly persecuted; but now their condition is greatly improved, and they are admitted in most European countries to all the rights of free citizens. In 1860 the "Jewish disabilities" were removed, and they were admitted to a seat in the British Parliament. Their number in all is estimated at about six millions, about four millions being in Europe.  </p><p> There are three names used in the New Testament to designate this people, </p><li> Jews, as regards their nationality, to distinguish them from Gentiles. </li><li> Hebrews, with regard to their language and education, to distinguish them from Hellenists, i.e., Jews who spoke the Greek language. </li><li> Israelites, as respects their sacred privileges as the chosen people of God. "To other races we owe the splendid inheritance of modern civilization and secular culture; but the religious education of mankind has been the gift of the Jew alone."   </li>
Jewess	<p>a woman of Hebrew birth, as Eunice, the mother of Timothy ( Acts 16:1 ;  2 Tim  1:5 ), and Drusilla ( Acts 24:24 ), wife of Felix, and daughter of Herod Agrippa I.  </p>
Jezebel	<p>chaste, the daughter of Ethbaal, the king of the Zidonians, and the wife of Ahab, the king of Israel ( 1 Kings 16:31 ). This was the "first time that a king of Israel had allied himself by marriage with a heathen princess; and the alliance was in this case of a peculiarly disastrous kind. Jezebel has stamped her name on history as the representative of all that is designing, crafty, malicious, revengeful, and cruel. She is the first great instigator of persecution against the saints of God. Guided by no principle, restrained by no fear of either God or man, passionate in her attachment to her heathen worship, she spared no pains to maintain idolatry around her in all its splendour. Four hundred and fifty prophets ministered under her care to Baal, besides four hundred prophets of the groves [RSV, 'prophets of the Asherah'], which ate at her table ( 1 Kings 18:19 ). The idolatry, too, was of the most debased and sensual kind." Her conduct was in many respects very disastrous to the kingdom both of Israel and Judah ( 21:1-29 ). At length she came to an untimely end. As Jehu rode into the gates of Jezreel, she looked out at the window of the palace, and said, "Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?" He looked up and called to her chamberlains, who instantly threw her from the window, so that she was dashed in pieces on the street, and his horses trod her under their feet. She was immediately consumed by the dogs of the street ( 2 Kings 9:7-37 ), according to the word of Elijah the Tishbite ( 1 Kings 21:19 ).  </p><p> Her name afterwards came to be used as the synonym for a wicked woman ( Revelation 2: :  20 ).  </p><p> It may be noted that she is said to have been the grand-aunt of Dido, the founder of Carthage. </p>
Jeziel	<p>assembled by God, a son of Azmaveth. He was one of the Benjamite archers who joined David at Ziklag ( 1 Chronicles 12:3 ).  </p>
Jezreel	<p>God scatters. </p><li> A town of Issachar ( Joshua 19:18 ), where the kings of Israel often resided ( 1 Kings 18:45 ;  21:1 ;  2 Kings  9:30 ). Here Elijah met Ahab, Jehu, and Bidkar; and here Jehu executed his dreadful commission against the house of Ahab ( 2 Kings 9:14-37 ;  10:1-11 ). It has been identified with the modern Zerin, on the most western point of the range of Gilboa, reaching down into the great and fertile valley of Jezreel, to which it gave its name.  </li><li> A town in Judah ( Joshua 15:56 ), to the south-east of Hebron. Ahinoam, one of David's wives, probably belonged to this place ( 1 Samuel 27:3 ).  </li><li> A symbolical name given by Hosea to his oldest son ( Hosea 1:4 ), in token of a great slaughter predicted by him, like that which had formerly taken place in the plain of Esdraelon (Compare  Hosea 1:4 Hosea 1:5 ).   </li>
Jezreel, Blood of	<p>the murder perpetrated here by Ahab and Jehu ( Hosea 1:4 ; Compare  1 Kings 18:4 ;  2 Kings  9:6-10 ).  </p>
Jezreel, Day of	<p>the time predicted for the execution of vengeance for the deeds of blood committed there ( Hosea 1:5 ).  </p>
Jezreel, Ditch of	<p>( 1 Kings 21:23 ; Compare 13), the fortification surrounding the city, outside of which Naboth was executed.  </p>
Jezreel, Fountain of	<p>where Saul encamped before the battle of Gilboa ( 1 Samuel 29:1 ). In the valley under Zerin there are two considerable springs, one of which, perhaps that here referred to, "flows from under a sort of cavern in the wall of conglomerate rock which here forms the base of Gilboa. The water is excellent; and issuing from crevices in the rocks, it spreads out at once into a fine limpid pool forty or fifty feet in diameter, full of fish" (Robinson). This may be identical with the "well of Harod" ( Judges 7:1 ; Compare  2 Samuel 23:25 ), probably the 'Ain Jalud, i.e., the "spring of Goliath."  </p>
Jezreel, Portion of	<p>the field adjoining the city ( 2 Kings 9:10 2 Kings 9:21 2 Kings 9:36 2 Kings 9:37 ). Here Naboth was stoned to death ( 1 Kings 21:13 ).  </p>
Jezreel, Tower of	<p>one of the turrets which guarded the entrance to the city ( 2 Kings 9:17 ).  </p>
Jezreel, Valley of	<p>lying on the northern side of the city, between the ridges of Gilboa and Moreh, an offshoot of Esdraelon, running east to the Jordan ( Joshua 17:16 ;  Judges 6:33 ;  Hosea 1:5 ). It was the scene of the signal victory gained by the Israelites under Gideon over the Midianites, the Amalekites, and the "children of the east" ( Judges 6:3 ). Two centuries after this the Israelites were here defeated by the Philistines, and Saul and Jonathan, with the flower of the army of Israel, fell ( 1 Samuel 31:1-6 ).  </p><p> This name was in after ages extended to the whole of the plain of Esdraelon (q.v.). It was only this plain of Jezreel and that north of Lake Huleh that were then accessible to the chariots of the Canaanites (Compare  2 Kings 9:21 ;  10:15 ).  </p>
Joab	<p>Jehovah is his father. </p><li> One of the three sons of Zeruiah, David's sister, and "captain of the host" during the whole of David's reign ( 2 Samuel 2:13 ;  10:7 ;  11:1 ;  1 Kings 11:15 ). His father's name is nowhere mentioned, although his sepulchre at Bethlehem is mentioned ( 2 Samuel 2:32 ). His two brothers were Abishai and Asahel, the swift of foot, who was killed by Abner ( 2 Samuel 2:13-32 ), whom Joab afterwards treacherously murdered ( 3:22-27 ). He afterwards led the assault at the storming of the fortress on Mount Zion, and for this service was raised to the rank of "prince of the king's army" ( 2 Samuel 5:6-10 ;  1 Chronicles 27:34 ). His chief military achievements were, (1) against the allied forces of Syria and Ammon; (2) against Edom ( 1 Kings 11:15 1 Kings 11:16 ); and (3) against the Ammonites ( 2 Samuel 10:7-19 ;  2 Samuel 11:1 2 Samuel 11:11 ). His character is deeply stained by the part he willingly took in the murder of Uriah ( 11:14-25 ). He acted apparently from a sense of duty in putting Absalom to death ( 18:1-14 ). David was unmindful of the many services Joab had rendered to him, and afterwards gave the command of the army to Amasa, Joab's cousin ( 2 Samuel 20:1-13 ;  19:13 ). When David was dying Joab espoused the cause of Adonijah in preference to that of Solomon. He was afterwards slain by Benaiah, by the command of Solomon, in accordance with his father's injunction ( 2 Samuel 3:29 ;  20:5-13 ), at the altar to which he had fled for refuge. Thus this hoary conspirator died without one to lift up a voice in his favour. He was buried in his own property in the "wilderness," probably in the north-east of Jerusalem ( 1 Kings 2:5 1 Kings 2:28-34 ). Benaiah succeeded him as commander-in-chief of the army.  </li><li> 1 Chronicles 4:14 .  </li><li> Ezra 2:6 .   </li>
Joah	<p>Jehovah his brother; i.e., helper. </p><li> One of the sons of Obed-edom ( 1 Chronicles 26:4 ), a Korhite porter.  </li><li> A Levite of the family of Gershom ( 1 Chronicles 6:21 ), probably the same as Ethan (42).  </li><li> The son of Asaph, and "recorder" (q.v.) or chronicler to King Hezekiah ( 2 Kings 18:18 2 Kings 18:26 2 Kings 18:37 ).  </li><li> Son of Joahaz, and "recorder" (q.v.) or keeper of the state archives under King Josiah ( 2 Chronicles 34:8 ).   </li>
Joahaz	<p>( 2 Chronicles 34:8 ), a contracted form of Jehoahaz (q.v.).  </p>
Joanna	<p>whom Jehovah has graciously given. </p><li> The grandson of Zerubbabel, in the lineage of Christ ( Luke 3:27 ); the same as Hananiah ( 1 Chronicles 3:19 ).  </li><li> The wife of Chuza, the steward of Herod Antipas, tetrarch of Galilee ( Luke 8:3 ). She was one of the women who ministered to our Lord, and to whom he appeared after his resurrection ( Luke 8:3 ;  24:10 ).   </li>
Joash	<p>whom Jehovah bestowed. </p><li> A contracted form of Jehoash, the father of Gideon ( Judges 6:11 Judges 6:29 ;  Judges 8:13 Judges 8:29 Judges 8:32 ).  </li><li> One of the Benjamite archers who joined David at Ziklag ( 1 Chronicles 12:3 ).  </li><li> One of King Ahab's sons ( 1 Kings 22:26 ).  </li><li> King of Judah ( 2 Kings 11:2 ;  2 Kings 12:19 2 Kings 12:20 ). (See JEHOASH [1].)  </li><li> King of Israel ( 2 Kings 13:9 2 Kings 13:12 2 Kings 13:13 2 Kings 13:25 ). (See JEHOASH [2].)  </li><li> 1 Chronicles 7:8 .  </li><li> One who had charge of the royal stores of oil under David and Solomon ( 1 Chronicles 27:28 ).   </li>
Job	<p>persecuted, an Arabian patriarch who resided in the land of Uz (q.v.). While living in the midst of great prosperity, he was suddenly overwhelmed by a series of sore trials that fell upon him. Amid all his sufferings he maintained his integrity. Once more God visited him with the rich tokens of his goodness and even greater prosperity than he had enjoyed before. He survived the period of trial for one hundred and forty years, and died in a good old age, an example to succeeding generations of integrity ( Ezekiel 14:14 Ezekiel 14:20 ) and of submissive patience under the sorest calamities ( James 5:11 ). His history, so far as it is known, is recorded in his book.  </p>
Job, Book of	<p>A great diversity of opinion exists as to the authorship of this book. From internal evidence, such as the similarity of sentiment and language to those in the Psalms and Proverbs (see  Psalms 88  and 89), the prevalence of the idea of "wisdom," and the style and character of the composition, it is supposed by some to have been written in the time of David and Solomon. Others argue that it was written by Job himself, or by Elihu, or Isaiah, or perhaps more probably by Moses, who was "learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and mighty in words and deeds" ( Acts 7:22 ). He had opportunities in Midian for obtaining the knowledge of the facts related. But the authorship is altogether uncertain.  </p><p> As to the character of the book, it is a historical poem, one of the greatest and sublimest poems in all literature. Job was a historical person, and the localities and names were real and not fictious. It is "one of the grandest portions of the inspired Scriptures, a heavenly-repleished storehouse of comfort and instruction, the patriarchal Bible, and a precious monument of primitive theology. It is to the Old Testament what the Epistle to the Romans is to the New." It is a didactic narrative in a dramatic form. </p><p> This book was apparently well known in the days of Ezekiel, B.C. 600 ( Ezekiel 14:14 ). It formed a part of the sacred Scriptures used by our Lord and his apostles, and is referred to as a part of the inspired Word ( Hebrews 12:5 ;  1 Corinthians 3:19 ).  </p><p> The subject of the book is the trial of Job, its occasion, nature, endurance, and issue. It exhibits the harmony of the truths of revelation and the dealings of Providence, which are seen to be at once inscrutable, just, and merciful. It shows the blessedness of the truly pious, even amid sore afflictions, and thus ministers comfort and hope to tried believers of every age. It is a book of manifold instruction, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness ( 2 Timothy 3:16 ).  </p><p> It consists of, </p><li> An historical introduction in prose (ch. 1,2).  </li><li> The controversy and its solution, in poetry (ch.  3-42:6). ).  <p> Job's desponding lamentation (ch. 3) is the occasion of the controversy which is carried on in three courses of dialogues between Job and his three friends. The first course gives the commencement of the controversy (ch. 4-14); the second the growth of the controversy (15-21); and the third the height of the controversy (22-27). This is followed by the solution of the controversy in the speeches of Elihu and the address of Jehovah, followed by Job's humble confession ( 42:1-6 ) of his own fault and folly.  </p></li><li> The third division is the historical conclusion, in prose ( 42:7-15 ).  <p> Sir J. W. Dawson in "The Expositor" says: "It would now seem that the language and theology of the book of Job can be better explained by supposing it to be a portion of Minean [Southern Arabia] literature obtained by Moses in Midian than in any other way. This view also agrees better than any other with its references to natural objects, the art of mining, and other matters." </p> </li>
Jobab	<p>dweller in the desert. </p><li> One of the sons of Joktan, and founder of an Arabian tribe ( Genesis 10:29 ). </li><li> King of Edom, succeeded Bela ( Genesis 36:33 Genesis 36:34 ). </li><li> A Canaanitish king ( Joshua 11:1 ) who joined the confederacy against Joshua.   </li>
Jochebed	<p>Jehovah is her glory, the wife of Amram, and the mother of Miriam, Aaron, and Moses ( Numbers 26:59 ). She is spoken of as the sister of Kohath, Amram's father ( Exodus 6:20 ; Compare 16,18;  2:1-10 ).  </p>
Joel	<p>Jehovah is his God. </p><li> The oldest of Samuel's two sons appointed by him as judges in Beersheba ( 1 Samuel 8:2 ). (See VASHNI (n/a).) </li><li> A descendant of Reuben ( 1 Chronicles 5:4 1 Chronicles 5:8 ). </li><li> One of David's famous warriors ( 1 Chronicles 11:38 ). </li><li> A Levite of the family of Gershom ( 1 Chronicles 15:7 1 Chronicles 15:11 ). </li><li> 1 Chronicles 7:3 . </li><li> 1 Chronicles 27:20 . </li><li> The second of the twelve minor prophets. He was the son of Pethuel. His personal history is only known from his book.   </li>
Joel, Book of	<p>Joel was probably a resident in Judah, as his commission was to that people. He makes frequent mention of Judah and Jerusalem ( 1:14 ;  1 Chronicles 2:1 1 Chronicles 2:15 1 Chronicles 2:32 ;  1 Chronicles 3:1 1 Chronicles 3:12 1 Chronicles 3:17 1 Chronicles 3:20 1 Chronicles 3:21 ).  </p><p> He probably flourished in the reign of Uzziah (about B.C. 800), and was contemporary with Amos and Isaiah.  </p><p> The contents of this book are, </p><li> A prophecy of a great public calamity then impending over the land, consisting of a want of water and an extraordinary plague of locusts ( (1:1-2:11). ). </li><li> The prophet then calls on his countrymen to repent and to turn to God, assuring them of his readiness to forgive ( 2:12-17 ), and foretelling the restoration of the land to its accustomed fruitfulness (18-26). </li><li> Then follows a Messianic prophecy, quoted by Peter ( Acts 2:39 ). </li><li> Finally, the prophet foretells portents and judgments as destined to fall on the enemies of God (ch. 3, but in the Hebrew text 4).   </li>
Joelah	<p>a Benjamite who joined David at Ziklag ( 1 Chronicles 12:7 ).  </p>
Joezer	<p>Jehovah is his help, one of the Korhites who became part of David's body-guard ( 1 Chronicles 12:6 ).  </p>
Johanan	<p>whom Jehovah graciously bestows. </p><li> One of the Gadite heroes who joined David in the desert of Judah ( 1 Chronicles 12:12 ).  </li><li> The oldest of King Josiah's sons ( 1 Chronicles 3:15 ).  </li><li> Son of Careah, one of the Jewish chiefs who rallied round Gedaliah, whom Nebuchadnezzar had made governor in Jerusalem ( 2 Kings 25:23 ;  Jeremiah 40:8 ). He warned Gedaliah of the plans of Ishmael against him, a warning which was unheeded ( Jeremiah 40:13 Jeremiah 40:16 ). He afterwards pursued the murderer of the governor, and rescued the captives ( Jeremiah 41:8 Jeremiah 41:13 Jeremiah 41:15 Jeremiah 41:16 ). He and his associates subsequently fled to Tahpanhes in Egypt ( Jeremiah 43:2 Jeremiah 43:4 Jeremiah 43:5 ), taking Jeremiah with them. "The flight of Gedaliah's community to Egypt extinguished the last remaining spark of life in the Jewish state. The work of the ten centuries since Joshua crossed the Jordan had been undone."   </li>
John	<p></p><li> One who, with Annas and Caiaphas, sat in judgment on the apostles Peter and John ( Acts 4:6 ). He was of the kindred of the high priest; otherwise unknown.  </li><li> The Hebrew name of Mark (q.v.). He is designated by this name in the acts of the Apostles ( Acts 12:12 Acts 12:25 ;  Acts 13:5 Acts 13:13 ;  15:37 ).  </li><li> THE APOSTLE, brother of James the "Greater" ( Matthew 4:21 ;  10:2 ;  Mark 1:19 ;  3:17 ;  10:35 ). He was one, probably the younger, of the sons of Zebedee ( Matthew 4:21 ) and Salome ( Matthew 27:56 ; Compare  Mark 15:40 ), and was born at Bethsaida. His father was apparently a man of some wealth (Compare  Mark 1:20 ;  Luke 5:3 ;  John 19:27 ). He was doubtless trained in all that constituted the ordinary education of Jewish youth. When he grew up he followed the occupation of a fisherman on the Lake of Galilee. When John the Baptist began his ministry in the wilderness of Judea, John, with many others, gathered round him, and was deeply influenced by his teaching. There he heard the announcement, "Behold the Lamb of God," and forthwith, on the invitation of Jesus, became a disciple and ranked among his followers ( John 1:36 John 1:37 ) for a time. He and his brother then returned to their former avocation, for how long is uncertain. Jesus again called them ( Matthew 4: :  21 ;  Luke 5:1-11 ), and now they left all and permanently attached themselves to the company of his disciples. He became one of the innermost circle ( Mark 5:37 ;  Matthew 17:1 ;  26:37 ;  Mark 13:3 ). He was the disciple whom Jesus loved. In zeal and intensity of character he was a "Boanerges" ( Mark 3:17 ). This spirit once and again broke out ( Matthew 20:20-24 ;  Mark 10:35-41 ;  Luke 9:49 Luke 9:54 ). At the betrayal he and Peter follow Christ afar off, while the others betake themselves to hasty flight ( John 18:15 ). At the trial he follows Christ into the council chamber, and thence to the praetorium ( John 18:16 John 18:19 John 18:28 ) and to the place of crucifixion ( John 19:26 John 19:27 ). To him and Peter, Mary first conveys tidings of the resurrection ( 20:2 ), and they are the first to go and see what her strange words mean. After the resurrection he and Peter again return to the Sea of Galilee, where the Lord reveals himself to them ( John 21:1 John 21:7 ). We find Peter and John frequently after this together ( Acts 3:1 ;  4:13 ). John remained apparently in Jerusalem as the leader of the church there ( Acts 15:6 ;  Galatians 2:9 ). His subsequent history is unrecorded. He was not there, however, at the time of Paul's last visit ( Acts 21:15-40 ). He appears to have retired to Ephesus, but at what time is unknown. The seven churches of Asia were the objects of his special care ( Revelation 1:11 ). He suffered under persecution, and was banished to Patmos ( 1:9 ); whence he again returned to Ephesus, where he died, probably about A.D. 98, having outlived all or nearly all the friends and companions even of his maturer years. There are many interesting traditions regarding John during his residence at Ephesus, but these cannot claim the character of historical truth.   </li>
John the Baptist	<p>the "forerunner of our Lord." We have but fragmentary and imperfect accounts of him in the Gospels. He was of priestly descent. His father, Zacharias, was a priest of the course of Abia ( 1 Chronicles 24:10 ), and his mother, Elisabeth, was of the daughters of Aaron ( Luke 1:5 ). The mission of John was the subject of prophecy ( Matthew 3:3 ;  Isaiah 40:3 ;  Malachi 3:1 ). His birth, which took place six months before that of Jesus, was foretold by an angel. Zacharias, deprived of the power of speech as a token of God's truth and a reproof of his own incredulity with reference to the birth of his son, had the power of speech restored to him on the occasion of his circumcision ( Luke 1:64 ). After this no more is recorded of him for thirty years than what is mentioned in  Luke 1:80 . John was a Nazarite from his birth ( Luke 1:15 ;  Numbers 6:1-12 ). He spent his early years in the mountainous tract of Judah lying between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea ( Matthew 3:1-12 ).  </p><p> At length he came forth into public life, and great multitudes from "every quarter" were attracted to him. The sum of his preaching was the necessity of repentance. He denounced the Sadducees and Pharisees as a "generation of vipers," and warned them of the folly of trusting to external privileges ( Luke 3:8 ). "As a preacher, John was eminently practical and discriminating. Self-love and covetousness were the prevalent sins of the people at large. On them, therefore, he enjoined charity and consideration for others. The publicans he cautioned against extortion, the soldiers against crime and plunder." His doctrine and manner of life roused the entire south of Palestine, and the people from all parts flocked to the place where he was, on the banks of the Jordan. There he baptized thousands unto repentance.  </p><p> The fame of John reached the ears of Jesus in Nazareth ( Matthew 3:5 ), and he came from Galilee to Jordan to be baptized of John, on the special ground that it became him to "fulfil all righteousness" ( 3:15 ). John's special office ceased with the baptism of Jesus, who must now "increase" as the King come to his kingdom. He continued, however, for a while to bear testimony to the Messiahship of Jesus. He pointed him out to his disciples, saying, "Behold the Lamb of God." His public ministry was suddenly (after about six months probably) brought to a close by his being cast into prison by Herod, whom he had reproved for the sin of having taken to himself the wife of his brother Philip ( Luke 3:19 ). He was shut up in the castle of Machaerus (q.v.), a fortress on the southern extremity of Peraea, 9 miles east of the Dead Sea, and here he was beheaded. His disciples, having consigned the headless body to the grave, went and told Jesus all that had occurred ( Matthew 14:3-12 ). John's death occurred apparently just before the third Passover of our Lord's ministry. Our Lord himself testified regarding him that he was a "burning and a shining light" ( John 5:35 ).  </p>
John, First Epistle of	<p>the fourth of the catholic or "general" epistles. It was evidently written by John the evangelist, and probably also at Ephesus, and when the writer was in advanced age. The purpose of the apostle ( 1:1-4 ) is to declare the Word of Life to those to whom he writes, in order that they might be united in fellowship with the Father and his Son Jesus Christ. He shows that the means of union with God are, (1) on the part of Christ, his atoning work ( 1:7 ;  2:2 ;  3:5 ;  Revelation 4:10  Revelation 4:14 ;  Revelation 5:11 Revelation 5:12 ) and his advocacy ( 2:1 ); and (2), on the part of man, holiness ( 1:6 ), obedience ( 2:3 ), purity ( 3:3 ), faith ( 3:23 ;  4:3 ;  5:5 ), and love ( Revelation 2:7 Revelation 2:8 ;  3:14 ;  4:7 ;  5:1 ).  </p>
John, Gospel of	<p>The genuineness of this Gospel, i.e., the fact that the apostle John was its author, is beyond all reasonable doubt. In recent times, from about 1820, many attempts have been made to impugn its genuineness, but without success.  </p><p> The design of John in writing this Gospel is stated by himself ( John 20:31 ). It was at one time supposed that he wrote for the purpose of supplying the omissions of the synoptical, i.e., of the first three, Gospels, but there is no evidence for this. "There is here no history of Jesus and his teaching after the manner of the other evangelists. But there is in historical form a representation of the Christian faith in relation to the person of Christ as its central point; and in this representation there is a picture on the one hand of the antagonism of the world to the truth revealed in him, and on the other of the spiritual blessedness of the few who yield themselves to him as the Light of life" (Reuss).  </p><p> After the prologue ( 1:1-5 ), the historical part of the book begins with verse 6, and consists of two parts. The first part (1:6-ch. 12) contains the history of our Lord's public ministry from the time of his introduction to it by John the Baptist to its close. The second part (ch. 13-21) presents our Lord in the retirement of private life and in his intercourse with his immediate followers (13-17), and gives an account of his sufferings and of his appearances to the disciples after his resurrection (18-21).  </p><p> The peculiarities of this Gospel are the place it gives (1) to the mystical relation of the Son to the Father, and (2) of the Redeemer to believers; (3) the announcement of the Holy Ghost as the Comforter; (4) the prominence given to love as an element in the Christian character. It was obviously addressed primarily to Christians.  </p><p> It was probably written at Ephesus, which, after the destruction of Jerusalem (A.D. 70), became the centre of Christian life and activity in the East, about A.D. 90.  </p>
John, Second Epistle of	<p>is addressed to "the elect lady," and closes with the words, "The children of thy elect sister greet thee;" but some would read instead of "lady" the proper name Kyria. Of the thirteen verses composing this epistle seven are in the First Epistle. The person addressed is commended for her piety, and is warned against false teachers. </p>
John, Third Epistle of	<p>is addressed to Caius, or Gaius, but whether to the Christian of that name in Macedonia ( Acts 19: :  <span class="badLink">29</span> ) or in Corinth ( Romans 16:23 ) or in Derbe ( Acts 20:4 ) is uncertain. It was written for the purpose of commending to Gaius some Christians who were strangers in the place where he lived, and who had gone thither for the purpose of preaching the gospel (ver. 7).  </p><p> The Second and Third Epistles were probably written soon after the First, and from Ephesus. </p>
Joiada	<p>(whom Jehovah favours) = Jehoiada. </p><li> Nehemiah 3:6 . </li><li> One of the high priests ( Nehemiah 12:10 Nehemiah 12:11 Nehemiah 12:22 ).   </li>
Joiakim	<p>(whom Jehovah has set up) = Jehoiakim, a high priest, the son and successor of Jeshua ( Nehemiah 12:10 Nehemiah 12:12 Nehemiah 12:26 ).  </p>
Joiarib	<p>(whom Jehovah defends) = Jehoiarib. </p><li> The founder of one of the courses of the priests ( Nehemiah 11:10 ).  </li><li> Nehemiah 11:5 ; a descendant of Judah.  </li><li> Nehemiah 12:6 .  </li><li> Ezra 8:16 , a "man of understanding" whom Ezra sent to "bring ministers for the house of God."   </li>
Jokdeam	<p>a city in the mountains of Judah ( Joshua 15:56 ).  </p>
Jokim	<p>whom Jehovah has set up, one of the descendants of Shelah ( 1 Chronicles 4:22 ).  </p>
Jokmeam	<p>gathering of the people, a city of Ephraim, which was given with its suburbs to the Levites ( 1 Chronicles 6:68 ). It lay somewhere in the Jordan valley ( 1 Kings 4:12 , RSV; but in A.V. incorrectly "Jokneam").  </p>
Jokneam	<p>gathered by the people, ( Joshua 19:11 ;  21:34 ), a city "of Carmel" ( 12:22 ), i.e., on Carmel, allotted with its suburbs to the Merarite Levites. It is the modern Tell Kaimon, about 12 miles south-west of Nazareth, on the south of the river Kishon.  </p>
Jokshan	<p>snarer, the second son of Abraham and Keturah ( Genesis 25:2 Genesis 25:3 ;  1 Chronicles 1:32 ).  </p>
Joktan	<p>little, the second of the two sons of Eber ( Genesis 10:25 ;  1 Chronicles 1:19 ). There is an Arab tradition that Joktan (Arab. Kahtan) was the progenitor of all the purest tribes of Central and Southern Arabia.  </p>
Joktheel	<p>subdued by God. </p><li> A city of Judah near Lachish ( Joshua 1538 ,38). Perhaps the ruin Kutlaneh, south of Gezer.  </li><li> Amaziah, king of Judah, undertook a great expedition against Edom ( 2 Chronicles 25:5-10 ), which was completely successful. He routed the Edomites and slew vast numbers of them. So wonderful did this victory appear to him that he acknowledged that it could have been achieved only by the special help of God, and therefore he called Selah (q.v.), their great fortress city, by the name of Joktheel ( 2 Kings 14:7 ).   </li>
Jonadab	<p>=Jehon'adab. </p><li> The son of Rechab, and founder of the Rechabites (q.v.),  2 Kings 10:15 ;  Jeremiah 35:6 Jeremiah 35:10 .  </li><li> The son of Shimeah, David's brother ( 2 Samuel 13:3 ). He was "a very subtil man."   </li>
Jonah	<p>a dove, the son of Amittai of Gath-hepher. He was a prophet of Israel, and predicted the restoration of the ancient boundaries ( 2 Kings 14:25-27 ) of the kingdom. He exercised his ministry very early in the reign of Jeroboam II., and thus was contemporary with Hosea and Amos; or possibly he preceded them, and consequently may have been the very oldest of all the prophets whose writings we possess. His personal history is mainly to be gathered from the book which bears his name. It is chiefly interesting from the two-fold character in which he appears, (1) as a missionary to heathen Nineveh, and (2) as a type of the "Son of man."  </p>
Jonah, Book of	<p>This book professes to give an account of what actually took place in the experience of the prophet. Some critics have sought to interpret the book as a parable or allegory, and not as a history. They have done so for various reasons. Thus (1) some reject it on the ground that the miraculous element enters so largely into it, and that it is not prophetical but narrative in its form; (2) others, denying the possibility of miracles altogether, hold that therefore it cannot be true history.  </p><p> Jonah and his story is referred to by our Lord ( Matthew 12:39 Matthew 12:40 ;  Luke 11:29 ), a fact to which the greatest weight must be attached. It is impossible to interpret this reference on any other theory. This one argument is of sufficient importance to settle the whole question. No theories devised for the purpose of getting rid of difficulties can stand against such a proof that the book is a veritable history.  </p><p> There is every reason to believe that this book was written by Jonah himself. It gives an account of (1) his divine commission to go to Nineveh, his disobedience, and the punishment following ( 1:1-17 ); (2) his prayer and miraculous deliverance ( (1:17-2:10); ); (3) the second commission given to him, and his prompt obedience in delivering the message from God, and its results in the repentance of the Ninevites, and God's long-sparing mercy toward them (ch. 3); (4) Jonah's displeasure at God's merciful decision, and the rebuke tendered to the impatient prophet (ch. 4). Nineveh was spared after Jonah's mission for more than a century. The history of Jonah may well be regarded "as a part of that great onward movement which was before the Law and under the Law; which gained strength and volume as the fulness of the times drew near.", Perowne's Jonah.  </p>
Jonas	<p></p><li> Greek form of Jonah ( Matthew 12:39 Matthew 12:40 Matthew 12:41 , etc.).  </li><li> The father of the apostles Peter ( John 21:15-17 ) and Andrew; but the reading should be (also in  1:42 ), as in the Revised Version, "John," instead of Jonas.   </li>
Jonathan	<p>whom Jehovah gave, the name of fifteen or more persons that are mentioned in Scripture. The chief of these are, </p><li> A Levite descended from Gershom ( Judges 18:30 ). His history is recorded in  17:7-13  and  18:30 . The Rabbins changed this name into Manasseh "to screen the memory of the great lawgiver from the stain of having so unworthy an apostate among his near descendants." He became priest of the idol image at Dan, and this office continued in his family till the Captivity.  </li><li> The eldest son of king Saul, and the bosom friend of David. He is first mentioned when he was about thirty years of age, some time after his father's accession to the throne ( 1 Samuel 13:2 ). Like his father, he was a man of great strength and activity ( 2 Samuel 1:23 ), and excelled in archery and slinging (1Chr 12:2;  2 Samuel 1:22 ). The affection that evidently subsisted between him and his father was interrupted by the growth of Saul's insanity. At length, "in fierce anger," he left his father's presence and cast in his lot with the cause of David ( 1 Samuel 20:34 ). After an eventful career, interwoven to a great extent with that of David, he fell, along with his father and his two brothers, on the fatal field of Gilboa ( 1 Samuel 31:2 1 Samuel 31:8 ). He was first buried at Jabesh-gilead, but his remains were afterwards removed with those of his father to Zelah, in Benjamin ( 2 Samuel 21:12-14 ). His death was the occasion of David's famous elegy of "the Song of the Bow" ( 2 Samuel 1:17-27 ). He left one son five years old, Merib-baal, or Mephibosheth ( 2 Samuel 4:4 ; Compare  1 Chronicles 8:34 ).  </li><li> Son of the high priest Abiathar, and one who adhered to David at the time of Absalom's rebellion ( 2 Samuel 15:27 2 Samuel 15:36 ). He is the last descendant of Eli of whom there is any record.  </li><li> Son of Shammah, and David's nephew, and also one of his chief warriors ( 2 Samuel 21:21 ). He slew a giant in Gath.   </li>
Jonath-elem-rechokim	<p>dove of the dumbness of the distance; i.e., "the silent dove in distant places", title of  Psalms 56 . This was probably the name of some well known tune or melody to which the psalm was to be sung.  </p>
Joppa	<p>beauty, a town in the portion of Dan ( Joshua 19:46 ; A.V., "Japho"), on a sandy promontory between Caesarea and Gaza, and at a distance of 30 miles north-west from Jerusalem. It is one of the oldest towns in Asia. It was and still is the chief sea-port of Judea. It was never wrested from the Phoenicians. It became a Jewish town only in the second century B.C. It was from this port that Jonah "took ship to flee from the presence of the Lord" ( Jonah 1:3 ). To this place also the wood cut in Lebanon by Hiram's men for Solomon was brought in floats ( 2 Chronicles 2:16 ); and here the material for the building of the second temple was also landed ( Ezra 3:7 ). At Joppa, in the house of Simon the tanner, "by the sea-side," Peter resided "many days," and here, "on the house-top," he had his "vision of tolerance" ( Acts 9:36-43 ). It bears the modern name of Jaffa, and exibituds all the decrepitude and squalor of cities ruled over by the Turks. "Scarcely any other town has been so often overthrown, sacked, pillaged, burned, and rebuilt." Its present population is said to be about 16,000. It was taken by the French under Napoleon in 1799, who gave orders for the massacre here of 4,000 prisoners. It is connected with Jerusalem by the only carriage road that exists in the country, and also by a railway completed in 1892. It is noticed on monuments B.C. 1600-1300, and was attacked by Sannacharib B.C. 702.  </p>
Joram	<p>=Jeho'ram. </p><li> One of the kings of Israel ( 2 Kings 8:16 2 Kings 8:25 2 Kings 8:28 ). He was the son of Ahab.  </li><li> Jehoram, the son and successor of Jehoshaphat on the throne of Judah ( 2 Kings 8:24 ).   </li>
Jordan	<p>Heb. Yarden, "the descender;" Arab. Nahr-esh-Sheriah, "the watering-place" the chief river of Palestine. It flows from north to south down a deep valley in the centre of the country. The name descender is significant of the fact that there is along its whole course a descent to its banks; or it may simply denote the rapidity with which it "descends" to the Dead Sea. </p><p> It originates in the snows of Hermon, which feed its perennial fountains. Two sources are generally spoken of. </p><li> From the western base of a hill on which once stood the city of Dan, the northern border-city of Palestine, there gushes forth a considerable fountain called the Leddan, which is the largest fountain in Syria and the principal source of the Jordan. </li><li> Beside the ruins of Banias, the ancient Caesarea Philippi and the yet more ancient Panium, is a lofty cliff of limestone, at the base of which is a fountain. This is the other source of the Jordan, and has always been regarded by the Jews as its true source. It rushes down to the plain in a foaming torrent, and joins the Leddan about 5 miles south of Dan (Tell-el-Kady). </li><li> But besides these two historical fountains there is a third, called the Hasbany, which rises in the bottom of a valley at the western base of Hermon, 12 miles north of Tell-el-Kady. It joins the main stream about a mile below the junction of the Leddan and the Banias. The river thus formed is at this point about 45 feet wide, and flows in a channel from 12 to 20 feet below the plain. After this it flows, "with a swift current and a much-twisted course," through a marshy plain for some 6 miles, when it falls into the Lake Huleh, "the waters of Merom" (q.v.).  <p> During this part of its course the Jordan has descended about 1,100 feet. At Banias it is 1,080 feet above sea-level. Flowing from the southern extremity of Lake Huleh, here almost on a level with the sea, it flows for 2 miles "through a waste of islets and papyrus," and then for 9 miles through a narrow gorge in a foaming torrent onward to the Sea of Galilee (q.v.).  </p><p> "In the whole valley of the Jordan from the Lake Huleh to the Sea of Galilee there is not a single settled inhabitant. Along the whole eastern bank of the river and the lakes, from the base of Hermon to the ravine of Hieromax, a region of great fertility, 30 miles long by 7 or 8 wide, there are only some three inhabited villages. The western bank is almost as desolate. Ruins are numerous enough. Every mile or two is an old site of town or village, now well nigh hid beneath a dense jungle of thorns and thistles. The words of Scripture here recur to us with peculiar force: 'I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation...And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it...And your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste. Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate' ( Leviticus 26:31-34 ).", Dr. Porter's Handbook.  </p><p> From the Sea of Galilee, at the level of 682 feet below the Mediterranean, the river flows through a long, low plain called "the region of Jordan" ( Matthew 3:5 ), and by the modern Arabs the Ghor, or "sunken plain." This section is properly the Jordan of Scripture. Down through the midst of the "plain of Jordan" there winds a ravine varying in breadth from 200 yards to half a mile, and in depth from 40 to 150 feet. Through it the Jordan flows in a rapid, rugged, tortuous course down to the Dead Sea. The whole distance from the southern extremity of the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea is in a straight line about 65 miles, but following the windings of the river about 200 miles, during which it falls 618 feet. The total length of the Jordan from Banias is about 104 miles in a straight line, during which it falls 2,380 feet.  </p><p> There are two considerable affluents which enter the river between the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea, both from the east. </p></li><li> The Wady Mandhur, called the Yarmuk by the Rabbins and the Hieromax by the Greeks. It formed the boundary between Bashan and Gilead. It drains the plateau of the Hauran. </li><li> The Jabbok or Wady Zerka, formerly the northern boundary of Ammon. It enters the Jordan about 20 miles north of Jericho.  <p> The first historical notice of the Jordan is in the account of the separation of Abraham and Lot ( Genesis 13:10 ). "Lot beheld the plain of Jordan as the garden of the Lord." Jacob crossed and recrossed "this Jordan" ( 32:10 ). The Israelites passed over it as "on dry ground" ( Joshua 3:17 ;  Psalms 114:3 ). Twice afterwards its waters were miraculously divided at the same spot by Elijah and Elisha ( 2 Kings 2:8 2 Kings 2:14 ).  </p><p> The Jordan is mentioned in the Old Testament about one hundred and eighty times, and in the New Testament fifteen times. The chief events in gospel history connected with it are (1) John the Baptist's ministry, when "there went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and were baptized of him in Jordan" ( Matthew 3:6 ). </p></li><li> Jesus also "was baptized of John in Jordan" ( Mark 1:9 ).   </li>
Joseph	<p>remover or increaser. </p><li> The elder of the two sons of Jacob by Rachel ( Genesis 30:23 Genesis 30:24 ), who, on the occasion of his birth, said, "God hath taken away [Heb. 'asaph] my reproach." "The Lord shall add [Heb. yoseph] to me another son" ( Genesis 30:24 ). He was a child of probably six years of age when his father returned from Haran to Canaan and took up his residence in the old patriarchal town of Hebron. "Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age," and he "made him a long garment with sleeves" ( Genesis 37:3 , RSV marg.), i.e., a garment long and full, such as was worn by the children of nobles. This seems to be the correct rendering of the words. The phrase, however, may also be rendered, "a coat of many pieces", i.e., a patchwork of many small pieces of divers colours.  <p> When he was about seventeen years old Joseph incurred the jealous hatred of his brothers ( Genesis 37:4 ). They "hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him." Their anger was increased when he told them his dreams ( 37:11 ).  </p><p> Jacob desiring to hear tidings of his sons, who had gone to Shechem with their flocks, some 60 miles from Hebron, sent Joseph as his messenger to make inquiry regarding them. Joseph found that they had left Shechem for Dothan, whither he followed them. As soon as they saw him coming they began to plot against him, and would have killed him had not Reuben interposed. They ultimately sold him to a company of Ishmaelite merchants for twenty pieces (shekels) of silver (about $2,10s.), ten pieces less than the current value of a slave, for "they cared little what they had for him, if so be they were rid of him." These merchants were going down with a varied assortment of merchandise to the Egyptian market, and thither they conveyed him, and ultimately sold him as a slave to Potiphar, an "officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard" ( Genesis 37:36 ). "The Lord blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake," and Potiphar made him overseer over his house. At length a false charge having been brought against him by Potiphar's wife, he was at once cast into the state prison (39; 40), where he remained for at least two years. After a while the "chief of the cupbearers" and the "chief of the bakers" of Pharaoh's household were cast into the same prison ( 40:2 ). Each of these new prisoners dreamed a dream in the same night, which Joseph interpreted, the event occurring as he had said.  </p><p> This led to Joseph's being remembered subsequently by the chief butler when Pharaoh also dreamed. At his suggestion Joseph was brought from prison to interpret the king's dreams. Pharaoh was well pleased with Joseph's wisdom in interpreting his dreams, and with his counsel with reference to the events then predicted; and he set him over all the land of Egypt ( Genesis 41:46 ), and gave him the name of Zaphnath-paaneah. He was married to Asenath, the daughter of the priest of On, and thus became a member of the priestly class. Joseph was now about thirty years of age.  </p><p> As Joseph had interpreted, seven years of plenty came, during which he stored up great abundance of corn in granaries built for the purpose. These years were followed by seven years of famine "over all the face of the earth," when "all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy corn" ( Genesis 41:56 Genesis 41:57 ;  Genesis 47:13 Genesis 47:14 ). Thus "Joseph gathered up all the money that was in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought." Afterwards all the cattle and all the land, and at last the Egyptians themselves, became the property of Pharaoh.  </p><p> During this period of famine Joseph's brethren also came down to Egypt to buy corn. The history of his dealings with them, and of the manner in which he at length made himself known to them, is one of the most interesting narratives that can be read ( Genesis 4245 -45). Joseph directed his brethren to return and bring Jacob and his family to the land of Egypt, saying, "I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land. Regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land is yours." Accordingly Jacob and his family, to the number of threescore and ten souls, together with "all that they had," went down to Egypt. They were settled in the land of Goshen, where Joseph met his father, and "fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while" ( Genesis 46:29 ).  </p><p> The excavations of Dr. Naville have shown the land of Goshen to be the Wady Tumilat, between Ismailia and Zagazig. In Goshen (Egyptian Qosem) they had pasture for their flocks, were near the Asiatic frontier of Egypt, and were out of the way of the Egyptian people. An inscription speaks of it as a district given up to the wandering shepherds of Asia. </p><p> Jacob at length died, and in fulfilment of a promise which he had exacted, Joseph went up to Canaan to bury his father in "the field of Ephron the Hittite" ( Genesis 47:29-31 ;  50:1-14 ). This was the last recorded act of Joseph, who again returned to Egypt.  </p><p> "The 'Story of the Two Brothers,' an Egyptian romance written for the son of the Pharaoh of the Oppression, contains an episode very similar to the Biblical account of Joseph's treatment by Potiphar's wife. Potiphar and Potipherah are the Egyptian Pa-tu-pa-Ra, 'the gift of the sun-god.' The name given to Joseph, Zaphnath-paaneah, is probably the Egyptian Zaf-nti-pa-ankh, 'nourisher of the living one,' i.e., of the Pharaoh. There are many instances in the inscriptions of foreigners in Egypt receiving Egyptian names, and rising to the highest offices of state." </p><p> By his wife Asenath, Joseph had two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim ( Genesis 41:50 ). Joseph having obtained a promise from his brethren that when the time should come that God would "bring them unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob," they would carry up his bones out of Egypt, at length died, at the age of one hundred and ten years; and "they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin" ( Genesis 50:26 ). This promise was faithfully observed. Their descendants, long after, when the Exodus came, carried the body about with them during their forty years' wanderings, and at length buried it in Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor ( Joshua 24:32 ; Compare  Genesis 33:19 ). With the death of Joseph the patriarchal age of the history of Israel came to a close.  </p><p> The Pharaoh of Joseph's elevation was probably Apepi, or Apopis, the last of the Hyksos kings. Some, however, think that Joseph came to Egypt in the reign of Thothmes III. (see PHARAOH), long after the expulsion of the Hyksos. </p><p> The name Joseph denotes the two tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh in  Deuteronomy 33:13-17 ; the kingdom of Israel in  Ezekiel 37:16 Ezekiel 37:19 ,  Amos 5:6 ; and the whole covenant people of Israel in  Psalms 81:4 .  </p></li><li> One of the sons of Asaph, head of the first division of sacred musicians ( 1 Chronicles 25:2 1 Chronicles 25:9 ).  </li><li> The son of Judah, and father of Semei ( Luke 3:26 ). Other two of the same name in the ancestry of Christ are also mentioned ( Luke 3:24 Luke 3:30 ).  </li><li> The foster-father of our Lord ( Matthew 1:16 ;  Luke 3:23 ). He lived at Nazareth in Galilee ( Luke 2:4 ). He is called a "just man." He was by trade a carpenter ( Matthew 13:55 ). He is last mentioned in connection with the journey to Jerusalem, when Jesus was twelve years old. It is probable that he died before Jesus entered on his public ministry. This is concluded from the fact that Mary only was present at the marriage feast in Cana of Galilee. His name does not appear in connection with the scenes of the crucifixion along with that of Mary (q.v.),  John 19:25 .  </li><li> A native of Arimathea, probably the Ramah of the Old Testament ( 1 Samuel 1:19 ), a man of wealth, and a member of the Sanhedrim ( Matthew 27:57 ;  Luke 23:50 ), an "honourable counsellor, who waited for the kingdom of God." As soon as he heard the tidings of Christ's death, he "went in boldly" (lit. "having summoned courage, he went") "unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus." Pilate having ascertained from the centurion that the death had really taken place, granted Joseph's request, who immediately, having purchased fine linen ( Mark 15:46 ), proceeded to Golgotha to take the body down from the cross. There, assisted by Nicodemus, he took down the body and wrapped it in the fine linen, sprinkling it with the myrrh and aloes which Nicodemus had brought ( John 19:39 ), and then conveyed the body to the new tomb hewn by Joseph himself out of a rock in his garden hard by. There they laid it, in the presence of Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Joses, and other women, and rolled a great stone to the entrance, and departed ( Luke 23:53 Luke 23:55 ). This was done in haste, "for the Sabbath was drawing on" (Compare  Isaiah 53:9 ).  </li><li> Surnamed Barsabas ( Acts 1:23 ); also called Justus. He was one of those who "companied with the apostles all the time that the Lord Jesus went out and in among them" ( Acts 1:21 ), and was one of the candidates for the place of Judas.   </li>
Joshua	<p>Jehovah is his help, or Jehovah the Saviour. The son of Nun, of the tribe of Ephraim, the successor of Moses as the leader of Israel. He is called Jehoshua in  Numbers 13:16  (A.V.), and Jesus in  Acts 7:45  and  Hebrews 4:8  (RSV, Joshua).  </p><p> He was born in Egypt, and was probably of the age of Caleb, with whom he is generally associated. He shared in all the events of the Exodus, and held the place of commander of the host of the Israelites at their great battle against the Amalekites in Rephidim ( Exodus 17:8-16 ). He became Moses' minister or servant, and accompanied him part of the way when he ascended Mount Sinai to receive the two tables ( Exodus 32:17 ). He was also one of the twelve who were sent on by Moses to explore the land of Canaan ( Numbers 13:16 Numbers 13:17 ), and only he and Caleb gave an encouraging report. Under the direction of God, Moses, before his death, invested Joshua in a public and solemn manner with authority over the people as his successor ( Deuteronomy 31:23 ). The people were encamped at Shittim when he assumed the command ( Joshua 1:1 ); and crossing the Jordan, they encamped at Gilgal, where, having circumcised the people, he kept the Passover, and was visited by the Captain of the Lord's host, who spoke to him encouraging words ( 1:1-9 ).  </p><p> Now began the wars of conquest which Joshua carried on for many years, the record of which is in the book which bears his name. Six nations and thirty-one kings were conquered by him ( Joshua 11:18-23 ;  12:24 ). Having thus subdued the Canaanites, Joshua divided the land among the tribes, Timnath-serah in Mount Ephraim being assigned to himself as his own inheritance. (See SHILOH;  PRIEST .) </p><p> His work being done, he died, at the age of one hundred and ten years, twenty-five years after having crossed the Jordan. He was buried in his own city of Timnath-serah ( Joshua 24 ); and "the light of Israel for the time faded away."  </p><p> Joshua has been regarded as a type of Christ ( Hebrews 4:8 ) in the following particulars: (1) In the name common to both; (2) Joshua brings the people into the possession of the Promised Land, as Jesus brings his people to the heavenly Canaan; and (3) as Joshua succeeded Moses, so the Gospel succeeds the Law.  </p><p> The character of Joshua is thus well sketched by Edersheim:, "Born a slave in Egypt, he must have been about forty years old at the time of the Exodus. Attached to the person of Moses, he led Israel in the first decisive battle against Amalek ( Exodus 17:9 Exodus 17:13 ), while Moses in the prayer of faith held up to heaven the God-given 'rod.' It was no doubt on that occasion that his name was changed from Oshea, 'help,' to Jehoshua, 'Jehovah is help' ( Numbers 13:16 ). And this name is the key to his life and work. Alike in bringing the people into Canaan, in his wars, and in the distribution of the land among the tribes, from the miraculous crossing of Jordan and taking of Jericho to his last address, he was the embodiment of his new name, 'Jehovah is help.' To this outward calling his character also corresponded. It is marked by singleness of purpose, directness, and decision...He sets an object before him, and unswervingly follows it" (Bible Hist., iii. 103)  </p>
Joshua, The Book of	<p>contains a history of the Israelites from the death of Moses to that of Joshua. It consists of three parts: </p><li> The history of the conquest of the land (1-12). </li><li> The allotment of the land to the different tribes, with the appointment of cities of refuge, the provision for the Levites (13-22), and the dismissal of the eastern tribes to their homes. This section has been compared to the Domesday Book of the Norman conquest. </li><li> The farewell addresses of Joshua, with an account of his death (23,24).  <p> This book stands first in the second of the three sections, (1) the Law, (2) the Prophets, (3) the "other writings" = Hagiographa, into which the Jewish Church divided the Old Testament. There is every reason for concluding that the uniform tradition of the Jews is correct when they assign the authorship of the book to Joshua, all except the concluding section; the last verses ( 24:29-33 ) were added by some other hand.  </p><p> There are two difficulties connected with this book which have given rise to much discussion, </p></li><li> The miracle of the standing still of the sun and moon on Gibeon. The record of it occurs in Joshua's impassioned prayer of faith, as quoted ( Joshua 10:12-15 ) from the "Book of Jasher" (q.v.). There are many explanations given of these words. They need, however, present no difficulty if we believe in the possibility of God's miraculous interposition in behalf of his people. Whether it was caused by the refraction of the light, or how, we know not.  </li><li> Another difficulty arises out of the command given by God utterly to exterminate the Canaanites. "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?" It is enough that Joshua clearly knew that this was the will of God, who employs his terrible agencies, famine, pestilence, and war, in the righteous government of this world. The Canaanites had sunk into a state of immorality and corruption so foul and degrading that they had to be rooted out of the land with the edge of the sword. "The Israelites' sword, in its bloodiest executions, wrought a work of mercy for all the countries of the earth to the very end of the world."  <p> This book resembles the Acts of the Apostles in the number and variety of historical incidents it records, and in its many references to persons and places; and as in the latter case the epistles of Paul (see Paley's Horae Paul.) confirm its historical accuracy by their incidental allusions and "undesigned coincidences," so in the former modern discoveries confirm its historicity. The Amarna tablets (see ADONIZEDEC) are among the most remarkable discoveries of the age. Dating from about B.C. 1480 down to the time of Joshua, and consisting of official communications from Amorite, Phoenician, and Philistine chiefs to the king of Egypt, they afford a glimpse into the actual condition of Palestine prior to the Hebrew invasion, and illustrate and confirm the history of the conquest. A letter, also still extant, from a military officer, "master of the captains of Egypt," dating from near the end of the reign of Rameses II., gives a curious account of a journey, probably official, which he undertook through Palestine as far north as to Aleppo, and an insight into the social condition of the country at that time. Among the things brought to light by this letter and the Amarna tablets is the state of confusion and decay that had now fallen on Egypt. The Egyptian garrisons that had held possession of Palestine from the time of Thothmes III., some two hundred years before, had now been withdrawn. The way was thus opened for the Hebrews. In the history of the conquest there is no mention of Joshua having encountered any Egyptian force. The tablets contain many appeals to the king of Egypt for help against the inroads of the Hebrews, but no help seems ever to have been sent. Is not this just such a state of things as might have been anticipated as the result of the disaster of the Exodus? In many points, as shown under various articles, the progress of the conquest is remarkably illustrated by the tablets. The value of modern discoveries in their relation to Old Testament history has been thus well described:  </p><p> "The difficulty of establishing the charge of lack of historical credibility, as against the testimony of the Old Testament, has of late years greatly increased. The outcome of recent excavations and explorations is altogether against it. As long as these books contained, in the main, the only known accounts of the events they mention, there was some plausibility in the theory that perhaps these accounts were written rather to teach moral lessons than to preserve an exact knowledge of events. It was easy to say in those times men had not the historic sense. But the recent discoveries touch the events recorded in the Bible at very many different points in many different generations, mentioning the same persons, countries, peoples, events that are mentioned in the Bible, and showing beyond question that these were strictly historic. The point is not that the discoveries confirm the correctness of the Biblical statements, though that is commonly the case, but that the discoveries show that the peoples of those ages had the historic sense, and, specifically, that the Biblical narratives they touch are narratives of actual occurrences." </p> </li>
Josiah	<p>healed by Jehovah, or Jehovah will support. The son of Amon, and his successor on the throne of Judah ( 2 Kings 22:1 ;  2 Chr.  <span class="badLink">34:1</span> ). His history is contained in  <span class="badLink">2 Kings 2223</span> ,23. He stands foremost among all the kings of the line of David for unswerving loyalty to Jehovah ( 23:25 ). He "did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in all the way of David his father." He ascended the throne at the early age of eight years, and it appears that not till eight years afterwards did he begin "to seek after the God of David his father." At that age he devoted himself to God. He distinguished himself by beginning a war of extermination against the prevailing idolatry, which had practically been the state religion for some seventy years ( 2 Chronicles 34:3 ; Compare  Jeremiah 25:3 Jeremiah 25:11 Jeremiah 25:29 ).  </p><p> In the eighteenth year of his reign he proceeded to repair and beautify the temple, which by time and violence had become sorely dilapidated ( 2 Kings 22:3 2 Kings 22:5 2 Kings 22:6 ;  23:23 ;  2 Chr  <span class="badLink">34:11</span> ). While this work was being carried on, Hilkiah, the high priest, discovered a roll, which was probably the original copy of the law, the entire Pentateuch, written by Moses.  </p><p> When this book was read to him, the king was alarmed by the things it contained, and sent for Huldah, the "prophetess," for her counsel. She spoke to him words of encouragement, telling him that he would be gathered to his fathers in peace before the threatened days of judgment came. Josiah immediately gathered the people together, and engaged them in a renewal of their ancient national covenant with God. The Passover was then celebrated, as in the days of his great predecessor, Hezekiah, with unusual magnificence. Nevertheless, "the Lord turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah" ( 2 Kings 22:3-20 ;  23:21-27 ;  2 Chr.  35:1-19 ). During the progress of this great religious revolution Jeremiah helped it on by his earnest exhortations.  </p><p> Soon after this, Pharaoh-Necho II. (q.v.), king of Egypt, in an expedition against the king of Assyria, with the view of gaining possession of Carchemish, sought a passage through the territory of Judah for his army. This Josiah refused to permit. He had probably entered into some new alliance with the king of Assyria, and faithful to his word he sought to oppose the progress of Necho. </p><p> The army of Judah went out and encountered that of Egypt at Megiddo, on the verge of the plain of Esdraelon. Josiah went into the field in disguise, and was fatally wounded by a random arrow. His attendants conveyed him toward Jerusalem, but had only reached Hadadrimmon, a few miles south of Megiddo, when he died ( 2 Kings 23:28 2 Kings 23:30 ; Compare  2 Chronicles 35:20-27 ), after a reign of thirty-one years. He was buried with the greatest honours in fulfilment of Huldah's prophecy ( 2 Kings 22:20 ; Compare  Jeremiah 34:5 ). Jeremiah composed a funeral elegy on this the best of the kings of Israel ( Lamentations 4:20 ;  2 Chr  <span class="badLink">35:25</span> ). The outburst of national grief on account of his death became proverbial ( Zechariah 12:11 ; Compare  Revelation 16:16 ).  </p>
Jot	<p>or Iota, the smallest letter of the Greek alphabet, used metaphorically or proverbially for the smallest thing ( Matthew 5:18 ); or it may be = yod, which is the smallest of the Hebrew letters.  </p>
Jotham	<p>Jehovah is perfect. </p><li> The youngest of Gideon's seventy sons. He escaped when the rest were put to death by the order of Abimelech ( Judges 9:5 ). When "the citizens of Shechem and the whole house of Millo" were gathered together "by the plain of the pillar" (i.e., the stone set up by Joshua,  24:26 ; Compare  Genesis 35:4 ) "that was in Shechem, to make Abimelech king," from one of the heights of Mount Gerizim he protested against their doing so in the earliest parable, that of the bramble-king. His words then spoken were prophetic. There came a recoil in the feelings of the people toward Abimelech, and then a terrible revenge, in which many were slain and the city of Shechem was destroyed by Abimelech ( Judges 9:45 ). Having delivered his warning, Jotham fled to Beer from the vengeance of Abimelech ( 9:7-21 ).  </li><li> The son and successor of Uzziah on the throne of Judah. As during his last years Uzziah was excluded from public life on account of his leprosy, his son, then twenty-five years of age, administered for seven years the affairs of the kingdom in his father's stead ( 2 Chronicles 26:21 2 Chronicles 26:23 ;  27:1 ). After his father's death he became sole monarch, and reigned for sixteen years (B.C. 759-743). He ruled in the fear of God, and his reign was prosperous. He was contemporary with the prophets Isaiah, Hosea, and Micah, by whose ministrations he profited. He was buried in the sepulchre of the kings, greatly lamented by the people ( 2 Kings 15:38 ;  2 Chr  27:7-9 ).   </li>
Journey	<p></p><li> A day's journey in the East is from 16 to 20 miles ( Numbers 11:31 ).  </li><li> A Sabbath-day's journey is 2,000 paces or yards from the city walls ( Acts 1:12 ). According to Jewish tradition, it was the distance one might travel without violating the law of  Exodus 16:29 . (See SABBATH .)  </li>
Jozabad	<p>whom Jehovah bestows. </p><li> One of the Benjamite archers who joined David at Ziklag ( 1 Chronicles 12:4 ).  </li><li> A chief of the tribe of Manasseh ( 1 Chronicles 12:20 ).   </li>
Jozachar	<p>Jehovah-remembered, one of the two servants who assassinated Jehoash, the king of Judah, in Millo ( 2 Kings 12:21 ). He is called also Zabad ( 2 Chronicles 24:26 ).  </p>
Jubal	<p>jubilee, music, Lamech's second son by Adah, of the line of Cain. He was the inventor of "the harp" (Heb. kinnor, properly "lyre") and "the organ" (Heb. 'ugab, properly "mouth-organ" or Pan's pipe),  Genesis 4:21 .  </p>
Jubilee	<p>a joyful shout or clangour of trumpets, the name of the great semi-centennial festival of the Hebrews. It lasted for a year. During this year the land was to be fallow, and the Israelites were only permitted to gather the spontaneous produce of the fields ( Leviticus 25:11 Leviticus 25:12 ). All landed property during that year reverted to its original owner (13-34;  27:16-24 ), and all who were slaves were set free ( 25:39-54 ), and all debts were remitted.  </p><p> The return of the jubilee year was proclaimed by a blast of trumpets which sounded throughout the land. There is no record in Scripture of the actual observance of this festival, but there are numerous allusions ( Isaiah 5:7 Isaiah 5:8 Isaiah 5:9 Isaiah 5:10 ;  Isaiah 61:1 Isaiah 61:2 ; Ezek.  Isaiah 7:12 Isaiah 7:13 ;  Nehemiah 5:1-19 ;  2 Chr  36:21 ) which place it beyond a doubt that it was observed.  </p><p> The advantages of this institution were manifold. "1. It would prevent the accumulation of land on the part of a few to the detriment of the community at large. 2. It would render it impossible for any one to be born to absolute poverty, since every one had his hereditary land. 3. It would preclude those inequalities which are produced by extremes of riches and poverty, and which make one man domineer over another. 4. It would utterly do away with slavery. 5. It would afford a fresh opportunity to those who were reduced by adverse circumstances to begin again their career of industry in the patrimony which they had temporarily forfeited. 6. It would periodically rectify the disorders which crept into the state in the course of time, preclude the division of the people into nobles and plebeians, and preserve the theocracy inviolate."  </p>
Juda	<p></p><li> The patriarch Judah, son of Jacob ( Luke 3:33 ;  Hebrews 7:14 ). In  Luke 1:39 ;  Hebrews 7:14 ;  Revelation 5:5 ;  7:5 , the word refers to the tribe of Judah.  </li><li> The father of Simeon in Christ's maternal ancestry ( Luke 3:30 ).  </li><li> Son of Joanna, and father of Joseph in Christ's maternal ancestry (26), probably identical with Abiud ( Matthew 1:13 ), and with Obadiah ( 1 Chronicles 3:21 ).  </li><li> One of the Lord's "brethren" ( Mark 6:3 ).   </li>
Judah	<p>praise, the fourth son of Jacob by Leah. The name originated in Leah's words of praise to the Lord on account of his birth: "Now will I praise [Heb. odeh] Jehovah, and she called his name Yehudah" ( Genesis 29:35 ).  </p><p> It was Judah that interposed in behalf of Joseph, so that his life was spared ( Genesis 37:26 Genesis 37:27 ). He took a lead in the affairs of the family, and "prevailed above his brethren" ( Genesis 43:3-10 ;  Genesis 44:14 Genesis 44:16-34 ;  46:28 ;  1 Chronicles 5:2 ).  </p><p> Soon after the sale of Joseph to the Ishmaelites, Judah went to reside at Adullam, where he married a woman of Canaan. (See ONAN; TAMAR .) After the death of his wife Shuah, he returned to his father's house, and there exercised much influence over the patriarch, taking a principal part in the events which led to the whole family at length going down into Egypt. We hear nothing more of him till he received his father's blessing ( Genesis 49:8-12 ).  </p>
Judah upon Jordan	<p>The Authorized Version, following the Vulgate, has this rendering in  Joshua 19:34 . It has been suggested that, following the Masoretic punctuation, the expression should read thus, "and Judah; the Jordan was toward the sun-rising." The sixty cities (Havoth-jair,  Numbers 32:41 ) on the east of Jordan were reckoned as belonging to Judah, because Jair, their founder, was a Manassite only on his mother's side, but on his father's side of the tribe of Judah ( 1 Chronicles 2:5 1 Chronicles 2:21-23 ).  </p>
Judah, Kingdom of	<p>When the disruption took place at Shechem, at first only the tribe of Judah followed the house of David. But very soon after the tribe of Benjamin joined the tribe of Judah, and Jerusalem became the capital of the new kingdom ( Joshua 18:28 ), which was called the kingdom of Judah. It was very small in extent, being only about the size of the Scottish county of Perth.  </p><p> For the first sixty years the kings of Judah aimed at re-establishing their authority over the kingdom of the other ten tribes, so that there was a state of perpetual war between them. For the next eighty years there was no open war between them. For the most part they were in friendly alliance, co-operating against their common enemies, especially against Damascus. For about another century and a half Judah had a somewhat checkered existence after the termination of the kingdom of Israel till its final overthrow in the destruction of the temple (B.C. 588) by Nebuzar-adan, who was captain of Nebuchadnezzar's body-guard ( 2 Kings 25:8-21 ).  </p><p> The kingdom maintained a separate existence for three hundred and eighty-nine years. It occupied an area of 3,435 square miles. (See ISRAEL, KINGDOM  OF .) </p>
Judah, Tribe of	<p>Judah and his three surviving sons went down with Jacob into Egypt ( Genesis 46:12 ;  Exodus 1:2 ). At the time of the Exodus, when we meet with the family of Judah again, they have increased to the number of 74,000 males ( Numbers 1:26 Numbers 1:27 ). Its number increased in the wilderness ( 26:22 ). Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, represented the tribe as one of the spies ( 13:6 ;  34:19 ). This tribe marched at the van on the east of the tabernacle ( Numbers 2:3-9 ;  10:14 ), its standard, as is supposed, being a lion's whelp. Under Caleb, during the wars of conquest, they conquered that portion of the country which was afterwards assigned to them as their inheritance. This was the only case in which any tribe had its inheritance thus determined ( Joshua 14:6-15 ;  15:13-19 ).  </p><p> The inheritance of the tribe of Judah was at first fully one-third of the whole country west of Jordan, in all about 2,300 square miles ( Joshua 15 ). But there was a second distribution, when Simeon received an allotment, about 1,000 square miles, out of the portion of Judah ( Joshua 19:9 ). That which remained to Judah was still very large in proportion to the inheritance of the other tribes. The boundaries of the territory are described in  Joshua 15:20-63 .  </p><p> This territory given to Judah was divided into four sections. </p><li> The south (Heb. negeb), the undulating pasture-ground between the hills and the desert to the south ( Joshua 15:21 .) This extent of pasture-land became famous as the favourite camping-ground of the old patriarchs. </li><li> The "valley" ( 15:33 ) or lowland (Heb. shephelah), a broad strip lying between the central highlands and the Mediterranean. This tract was the garden as well as the granary of the tribe. </li><li> The "hill-country," or the mountains of Judah, an elevated plateau stretching from below Hebron northward to Jerusalem. "The towns and villages were generally perched on the tops of hills or on rocky slopes. The resources of the soil were great. The country was rich in corn, wine, oil, and fruit; and the daring shepherds were able to lead their flocks far out over the neighbouring plains and through the mountains." The number of towns in this district was thirty-eight ( Joshua 15:48-60 ). </li><li> The "wilderness," the sunken district next the Dead Sea ( Joshua 15:61 ), "averaging 10 miles in breadth, a wild, barren, uninhabitable region, fit only to afford scanty pasturage for sheep and goats, and a secure home for leopards, bears, wild goats, and outlaws" ( 1 Samuel 17:34 ;  22:1 ;  Mark 1:13 ). It was divided into the "wilderness of En-gedi" ( 1 Samuel 24:1 ), the "wilderness of Judah" ( Judges 1:16 ;  Matthew 3:1 ), between the Hebron mountain range and the Dead Sea, the "wilderness of Maon" ( 1 Samuel 23:24 ). It contained only six cities.  <p> Nine of the cities of Judah were assigned to the priests ( Joshua 21:9-19 ).  </p> </li>
Judas	<p>the Graecized form of Judah. </p><li> The patriarch ( Matthew 1:2 Matthew 1:3 ).  </li><li> Son of Simon ( John 6:71 ;  John 13:2 John 13:26 ), surnamed Iscariot, i.e., a man of Kerioth ( Joshua 15:25 ). His name is uniformly the last in the list of the apostles, as given in the synoptic (i.e., the first three) Gospels. The evil of his nature probably gradually unfolded itself till "Satan entered into him" ( John 13:27 ), and he betrayed our Lord ( 18:3 ). Afterwards he owned his sin with "an exceeding bitter cry," and cast the money he had received as the wages of his iniquity down on the floor of the sanctuary, and "departed and went and hanged himself" ( Matthew 27:5 ). He perished in his guilt, and "went unto his own place" ( Acts 1:25 ). The statement in  Acts 1:18  that he "fell headlong and burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out," is in no way contrary to that in  Matthew 27:5 . The sucide first hanged himself, perhaps over the valley of Hinnom, "and the rope giving way, or the branch to which he hung breaking, he fell down headlong on his face, and was crushed and mangled on the rocky pavement below."  <p> Why such a man was chosen to be an apostle we know not, but it is written that "Jesus knew from the beginning who should betray him" ( John 6:64 ). Nor can any answer be satisfactorily given to the question as to the motives that led Judas to betray his Master. "Of the motives that have been assigned we need not care to fix on any one as that which simply led him on. Crime is, for the most part, the result of a hundred motives rushing with bewildering fury through the mind of the criminal."  </p></li><li> A Jew of Damascus ( Acts 9:11 ), to whose house Ananias was sent. The street called "Straight" in which it was situated is identified with the modern "street of bazaars," where is still pointed out the so-called "house of Judas."  </li><li> A Christian teacher, surnamed Barsabas. He was sent from Jerusalem to Antioch along with Paul and Barnabas with the decision of the council ( Acts 15:22 Acts 15:27 Acts 15:32 ). He was a "prophet" and a "chief man among the brethren."   </li>
Jude	<p>= Judas. Among the apostles there were two who bore this name, (1) Judas ( Jude 1:1 ;  Matthew 13:55 ;  John 14:22 ;  Acts 1:13 ), called also Lebbaeus or Thaddaeus ( Matthew 10:3 ;  Mark 3:18 ); and (2) Judas Iscariot ( Matthew 10:4 ;  Mark 3:19 ). He who is called "the brother of James" ( Luke 6:16 ), may be the same with the Judas surnamed Lebbaeus. The only thing recorded regarding him is in  John 14:22 .  </p>
Jude, Epistle of	<p>The author was "Judas, the brother of James" the Less ( Jude 1:1 ), called also Lebbaeus ( Matthew 10:3 ) and Thaddaeus ( Mark 3:18 ). The genuineness of this epistle was early questioned, and doubts regarding it were revived at the time of the Reformation; but the evidences in support of its claims are complete. It has all the marks of having proceeded from the writer whose name it bears.  </p><p> There is nothing very definite to determine the time and place at which it was written. It was apparently written in the later period of the apostolic age, for when it was written there were persons still alive who had heard the apostles preach (ver. 17). It may thus have been written about A.D. 66 or 70, and apparently in Palestine.  </p><p> The epistle is addressed to Christians in general (ver. 1), and its design is to put them on their guard against the misleading efforts of a certain class of errorists to which they were exposed. The style of the epistle is that of an "impassioned invective, in the impetuous whirlwind of which the writer is hurried along, collecting example after example of divine vengeance on the ungodly; heaping epithet upon epithet, and piling image upon image, and, as it were, labouring for words and images strong enough to depict the polluted character of the licentious apostates against whom he is warning the Church; returning again and again to the subject, as though all language was insufficient to give an adequate idea of their profligacy, and to express his burning hatred of their perversion of the doctrines of the gospel."  </p><p> The striking resemblance this epistle bears to 2Peter suggests the idea that the author of the one had seen the epistle of the other.  </p><p> The doxology with which the epistle concludes is regarded as the finest in the New Testament. </p>
Judea	<p>After the Captivity this name was applied to the whole of the country west of the Jordan ( Haggai 1:1 Haggai 1:14 ;  2:2 ). But under the Romans, in the time of Christ, it denoted the southernmost of the three divisions of Palestine ( Matthew 2:1 Matthew 2:5 ;  3:1 ;  4:25 ), although it was also sometimes used for Palestine generally ( Acts 28:21 ).  </p><p> The province of Judea, as distinguished from Galilee and Samaria, included the territories of the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, Dan, Simeon, and part of Ephraim. Under the Romans it was a part of the province of Syria, and was governed by a procurator. </p>
Judge	<p>(Heb. shophet, pl. shophetim), properly a magistrate or ruler, rather than one who judges in the sense of trying a cause. This is the name given to those rulers who presided over the affairs of the Israelites during the interval between the death of Joshua and the accession of Saul ( Judges 2:18 ), a period of general anarchy and confusion. "The office of judges or regents was held during life, but it was not hereditary, neither could they appoint their successors. Their authority was limited by the law alone, and in doubtful cases they were directed to consult the divine King through the priest by Urim and Thummim ( Numbers 27:21 ). Their authority extended only over those tribes by whom they had been elected or acknowledged. There was no income attached to their office, and they bore no external marks of dignity. The only cases of direct divine appointment are those of Gideon and Samson, and the latter stood in the peculiar position of having been from before his birth ordained 'to begin to deliver Israel.' Deborah was called to deliver Israel, but was already a judge. Samuel was called by the Lord to be a prophet but not a judge, which ensued from the high gifts the people recognized as dwelling in him; and as to Eli, the office of judge seems to have devolved naturally or rather ex officio upon him." Of five of the judges, Tola ( Judges 10:1 ), Jair (3), Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon ( 12:8-15 ), we have no record at all beyond the bare fact that they were judges. Sacred history is not the history of individuals but of the kingdom of God in its onward progress.  </p><p> In  Exodus 2:14  Moses is so styled. This fact may indicate that while for revenue purposes the "taskmasters" were over the people, they were yet, just as at a later time when under the Romans, governed by their own rulers.  </p>
Judges, Book of	<p>is so called because it contains the history of the deliverance and government of Israel by the men who bore the title of the "judges." The book of Ruth originally formed part of this book, but about A.D. 450 it was separated from it and placed in the Hebrew scriptures immediately after the Song of Solomon.  </p><p> The book contains, </p><li> An introduction ( (1-3:6), ), connecting it with the previous narrative in Joshua, as a "link in the chain of books." </li><li> The history of the thirteen ( Judges (3:7-16:31) ) in the following order:  <p> |       FIRST PERIOD (3:7-ch. 5) |                       Years | I. Servitude under Chushan-rishathaim of |  Mesopotamia                8 |  1. OTHNIEL delivers Israel, rest      40 | II. Servitude under Eglon of Moab: |  Ammon, Amalek               18 |  2. EHUD'S deliverance, rest        80 |  3. SHAMGAR Unknown. | III. Servitude under Jabin of Hazor in |  Canaan                  20 |  4. DEBORAH and, |  5. BARAK                  40 |                      (206) | |       SECOND PERIOD ( (6-10:5) ) | | IV. Servitude under Midian, Amalek, and |  children of the east            7 |  6. GIDEON                 40 |   ABIMELECH, Gideon's son, reigns as |    king over Israel            3 |  7. TOLA                  23 |  8. JAIR                  22 |                       (95) | |     THIRD PERIOD (10:6-ch. 12) | | V. Servitude under Ammonites with the |  Philistines                18 |  9. JEPHTHAH                 6 | 10. IBZAN                  7 | 11. ELON                  10 | 12. ABDON                  8 |                       (49) | |      FOURTH PERIOD (13-16) | VI. Seritude under Philistines        40 | 13. SAMSON                 20 |                       (60) |                   In all 410  </p><p> Samson's exploits probably synchronize with the period immediately preceding the national repentance and reformation under Samuel ( 1 Samuel 7:2-6 ).  </p><p> After Samson came Eli, who was both high priest and judge. He directed the civil and religious affairs of the people for forty years, at the close of which the Philistines again invaded the land and oppressed it for twenty years. Samuel was raised up to deliver the people from this oppression, and he judged Israel for some twelve years, when the direction of affairs fell into the hands of Saul, who was anointed king. If Eli and Samuel are included, there were then fifteen judges. But the chronology of this whole period is uncertain. </p></li><li> The historic section of the book is followed by an appendix (17-21), which has no formal connection with that which goes before. It records (a) the conquest (17,18) of Laish by a portion of the tribe of Dan; and (b) the almost total extinction of the tribe of Benjamin by the other tribes, in consequence of their assisting the men of Gibeah (19-21). This section properly belongs to the period only a few years after the death of Joshua. It shows the religious and moral degeneracy of the people.  <p> The author of this book was most probably Samuel. The internal evidence both of the first sixteen chapters and of the appendix warrants this conclusion. It was probably composed during Saul's reign, or at the very beginning of David's. The words in  1 Samuel 18:30  1 Samuel 18:31 , imply that it was written after the taking of the ark by the Philistines, and after it was set up at Nob ( 1 Samuel 21 ). In David's reign the ark was at Gibeon ( 1 Chronicles 16:39 )  </p> </li>
Judgment hall	<p>Gr. praitorion ( John 18:28 John 18:33 ;  19:9 ;  Matthew 27:27 ), "common hall." In all these passages the Revised Version renders "palace." In  Mark 15:16  the word is rendered "Praetorium" (q.v.), which is a Latin word, meaning literally the residence of the praetor, and then the governor's residence in general, though not a praetor. Throughout the Gospels the word "praitorion" has this meaning (Compare  Acts 23:35 ). Pilate's official residence when he was in Jerusalem was probably a part of the fortress of Antonia.  </p><p> The trial of our Lord was carried on in a room or office of the palace. The "whole band" spoken of by Mark were gathered together in the palace court. </p>
Judgment seat	<p>( Matthew 27:19 ), a portable tribunal (Gr. bema) which was placed according as the magistrate might direct, and from which judgment was pronounced. In this case it was placed on a tesselated pavement, probably in front of the procurator's residence. (See GABBATHA .) </p>
Judgment, The final	<p>the sentence that will be passed on our actions at the last day ( Matthew 25 ;  Romans 14:10 Romans 14:11 ;  2 co  5:10 ;  2 th  1:7-10 ).  </p><p> The judge is Jesus Christ, as mediator. All judgment is committed to him ( Acts 17:31 ;  John 5:22 John 5:27 ;  Revelation 1:7 ). "It pertains to him as mediator to complete and publicly manifest the salvation of his people and the overthrow of his enemies, together with the glorious righteousness of his work in both respects."  </p><p> The persons to be judged are, (1) the whole race of Adam without a single exception ( Matthew 25:31-46 ;  1 Corinthians 15:51 1 Corinthians 15:52 ;  Revelation 20:11-15 ); and (2) the fallen angels ( 2 Peter 2:4 ;  Jude 1:6 ).  </p><p> The rule of judgment is the standard of God's law as revealed to men, the heathen by the law as written on their hearts ( Luke 12:47 Luke 12:48 ;  Romans 2:12-16 ); the Jew who "sinned in the law shall be judged by the law" ( Romans 2:12 ); the Christian enjoying the light of revelation, by the will of God as made known to him ( Matthew 11:20-24 ;  John 3:19 ). Then the secrets of all hearts will be brought to light ( 1 Corinthians 4:5 ;  Luke 8:17 ;  Luke 12:2 Luke 12:3 ) to vindicate the justice of the sentence pronounced.  </p><p> The time of the judgment will be after the resurrection ( Hebrews 9:27 ;  Acts 17:31 ).  </p><p> As the Scriptures represent the final judgment "as certain [Eccl  11:9 ], universal [  2 Corinthians 5:10 ], righteous [  Romans 2:5 ], decisive [  1 Corinthians 15:52 ], and eternal as to its consequences [  Hebrews 6:2 ], let us be concerned for the welfare of our immortal interests, flee to the refuge set before us, improve our precious time, depend on the merits of the Redeemer, and adhere to the dictates of the divine word, that we may be found of him in peace."  </p>
Judgments of God	<p></p><li> The secret decisions of God's will ( Psalms 110:5 ;  36:6 ). </li><li> The revelations of his will ( Exodus 21:1 ;  Deuteronomy 6:20 ;  Psalms 119:7-175 ). </li><li> The infliction of punishment on the wicked ( Exodus 6:6 ;  12:12 ;  Ezekiel 25:11 ;  Revelation 16:7 ), such as is mentioned in  Genesis 7 ;  Genesis 19:24 Genesis 19:25 ;  Judges 1:6 Judges 1:7 ;  Acts 5:1-10 , etc.   </li>
Judith	<p>Jewess, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and one of Esau's wives ( Genesis 26:34 ), elsewhere called Aholibamah ( 36:2-14 ).  </p>
Julia	<p>a Christian woman at Rome to whom Paul sent his salutations ( Romans 16:15 ), supposed to be the wife of Philologus.  </p>
Julius	<p>the centurion of the Augustan cohort, or the emperor's body-guard, in whose charge Paul was sent prisoner to Rome ( Acts 27:1 Acts 27:3 Acts 27:43 ). He entreated Paul "courteously," showing in many ways a friendly regard for him.  </p>
Junia	<p>( Romans 16:7 ), a Christian at Rome to whom Paul sends salutations along with Andronicus.  </p>
Juniper	<p>(Heb. rothem), called by the Arabs retem, and known as Spanish broom; ranked under the genus genista. It is a desert shrub, and abounds in many parts of Palestine. In the account of his journey from Akabah to Jerusalem, Dr. Robinson says: "This is the largest and most conspicuous shrub of these deserts, growing thickly in the water-courses and valleys. Our Arabs always selected the place of encampment, if possible, in a spot where it grew, in order to be sheltered by it at night from the wind; and during the day, when they often went on in advance of the camels, we found them not unfrequently sitting or sleeping under a bush of retem to shelter them from the sun. It was in this very desert, a day's journey from Beersheba, that the prophet Elijah lay down and slept beneath the same shrub" ( 1 Kings 19:4 1 Kings 19:5 ). It afforded material for fuel, and also in cases of extremity for human food ( Psalms 120:4 ;  Job 30:4 ). One of the encampments in the wilderness of Paran is called Rithmah, i.e., "place of broom" ( Numbers 33:18 ).  </p><p> "The Bedawin of Sinai still burn this very plant into a charcoal which throws out the most intense heat." </p>
Jupiter	<p>the principal deity of the ancient Greeks and Romans. He was worshipped by them under various epithets. Barnabas was identified with this god by the Lycaonians ( Acts 14:12 ), because he was of stately and commanding presence, as they supposed Jupiter to be. There was a temple dedicated to this god outside the gates of Lystra ( 14:13 ).  </p>
Justice	<p>is rendering to every one that which is his due. It has been distinguished from equity in this respect, that while justice means merely the doing what positive law demands, equity means the doing of what is fair and right in every separate case. </p>
Justice of God	<p>that perfection of his nature whereby he is infinitely righteous in himself and in all he does, the righteousness of the divine nature exercised in his moral government. At first God imposes righteous laws on his creatures and executes them righteously. Justice is not an optional product of his will, but an unchangeable principle of his very nature. His legislative justice is his requiring of his rational creatures conformity in all respects to the moral law. His rectoral or distributive justice is his dealing with his accountable creatures according to the requirements of the law in rewarding or punishing them ( Psalms 89:14 ). In remunerative justice he distributes rewards ( James 1:12 ;  2 Tim  4:8 ); in vindictive or punitive justice he inflicts punishment on account of transgression ( 2 Thessalonians 1:6 ). He cannot, as being infinitely righteous, do otherwise than regard and hate sin as intrinsically hateful and deserving of punishment. "He cannot deny himself" ( 2 Timothy 2:13 ). His essential and eternal righteousness immutably determines him to visit every sin as such with merited punishment.  </p>
Justification	<p>a forensic term, opposed to condemnation. As regards its nature, it is the judicial act of God, by which he pardons all the sins of those who believe in Christ, and accounts, accepts, and treats them as righteous in the eye of the law, i.e., as conformed to all its demands. In addition to the pardon (q.v.) of sin, justification declares that all the claims of the law are satisfied in respect of the justified. It is the act of a judge and not of a sovereign. The law is not relaxed or set aside, but is declared to be fulfilled in the strictest sense; and so the person justified is declared to be entitled to all the advantages and rewards arising from perfect obedience to the law ( Romans 5:1-10 ).  </p><p> It proceeds on the imputing or crediting to the believer by God himself of the perfect righteousness, active and passive, of his Representative and Surety, Jesus Christ ( Romans 10:3-9 ). Justification is not the forgiveness of a man without righteousness, but a declaration that he possesses a righteousness which perfectly and for ever satisfies the law, namely, Christ's righteousness ( 2 Corinthians 5:21 ;  Romans 4:6-8 ).  </p><p> The sole condition on which this righteousness is imputed or credited to the believer is faith in or on the Lord Jesus Christ. Faith is called a "condition," not because it possesses any merit, but only because it is the instrument, the only instrument by which the soul appropriates or apprehends Christ and his righteousness ( Romans 1:17 ;  Romans 3:25 Romans 3:26 ;  Romans 4:20 Romans 4:22 ;  Philippians 3:8-11 ;  Galatians 2:16 ).  </p><p> The act of faith which thus secures our justification secures also at the same time our sanctification (q.v.); and thus the doctrine of justification by faith does not lead to licentiousness ( Romans 6:2-7 ). Good works, while not the ground, are the certain consequence of justification ( 6:14 ;  7:6 ). (See GALATIANS, EPISTLE  TO .) </p>
Justus	<p></p><li> Another name for Joseph, surnamed Barsabas. He and Matthias are mentioned only in  Acts 1:23 . "They must have been among the earliest disciples of Jesus, and must have been faithful to the end; they must have been well known and esteemed among the brethren. What became of them afterwards, and what work they did, are entirely unknown" (Lindsay's Acts of the Apostles).  </li><li> A Jewish proselyte at Corinth, in whose house, next door to the synagogue, Paul held meetings and preached after he left the synagogue ( Acts 18:7 ).  </li><li> A Jewish Christian, called Jesus, Paul's only fellow-labourer at Rome, where he wrote his Epistle to the Colossians ( Colossians 4:11 ).   </li>
Juttah	<p>extended, a Levitical city in the mountains or hill-country of Judah ( Joshua 15:55 ;  21:16 ). Its modern name is Yutta, a place about 5 1/2 miles south of Hebron. It is supposed to have been the residence of Zacharias and Elisabeth, and the birthplace of John the Baptist, and on this account is annually visited by thousands of pilgrims belonging to the Greek Church ( Luke 1:39 ). (See MARY .) </p>
Kine	<p>(Heb. sing. parah, i.e., "fruitful"), mentioned in Pharaoh's dream ( Genesis 41: :  18 ). Here the word denotes "buffaloes," which fed on the reeds and sedge by the river's brink.  </p>
King	<p>is in Scripture very generally used to denote one invested with authority, whether extensive or limited. There were thirty-one kings in Canaan ( Joshua 12:9 Joshua 12:24 ), whom Joshua subdued. Adonibezek subdued seventy kings ( Judges 1:7 ). In the New Testament the Roman emperor is spoken of as a king ( 1 Peter 2:13 1 Peter 2:17 ); and Herod Antipas, who was only a tetrarch, is also called a king ( Matthew 14:9 ;  Mark 6:22 ).  </p><p> This title is applied to God ( 1 Timothy 1:17 ), and to Christ, the Son of God ( 1 Timothy 6:15 1 Timothy 6:16 ;  Matthew 27:11 ). The people of God are also called "kings" ( Daniel 7:22 Daniel 7:27 ;  Matthew 19:28 ;  Revelation 1:6 , etc.). Death is called the "king of terrors" ( Job 18:14 ).  </p><p> Jehovah was the sole King of the Jewish nation ( 1 Samuel 8:7 ;  Isaiah 33:22 ). But there came a time in the history of that people when a king was demanded, that they might be like other nations ( 1 Samuel 8:5 ). The prophet Samuel remonstrated with them, but the people cried out, "Nay, but we will have a king over us." The misconduct of Samuel's sons was the immediate cause of this demand.  </p><p> The Hebrew kings did not rule in their own right, nor in name of the people who had chosen them, but partly as servants and partly as representatives of Jehovah, the true King of Israel ( 1 Samuel 10:1 ). The limits of the king's power were prescribed ( 1 Samuel 10:25 ). The officers of his court were, (1) the recorder or remembrancer ( 2 Samuel 8:16 ;  1 Kings 4:3 ); (2) the scribe ( 2 Samuel 8:17 ;  20:25 ); (3) the officer over the house, the chief steward ( Isaiah 22:15 ); (4) the "king's friend," a confidential companion ( 1 Kings 4:5 ); (5) the keeper of the wardrobe ( 2 Kings 22:14 ); (6) captain of the bodyguard ( 2 Samuel 20:23 ); (7) officers over the king's treasures, etc. ( 1 Chronicles 27:25-31 ); (8) commander-in-chief of the army ( 1 Chronicles 27:34 ); (9) the royal counsellor ( 1 Chronicles 27:32 ;  2 Sam  16:20-23 ).  </p><p> (For catalogue of kings of Israel and Judah see chronological table in Appendix.) </p>
Kingdom of God	<p>( Matthew 6:33 ;  Mark 1:14 Mark 1:15 ;  Luke 4:43 ) = "kingdom of Christ" ( Matthew 13:41 ;  20:21 ) = "kingdom of Christ and of God" ( Ephesians 5:5 ) = "kingdom of David" ( Mark 11:10 ) = "the kingdom" ( Matthew 8:12 ;  13:19 ) = "kingdom of heaven" ( Matthew 3:2 ;  4:17 ;  13:41 ), all denote the same thing under different aspects, viz.: (1) Christ's mediatorial authority, or his rule on the earth; (2) the blessings and advantages of all kinds that flow from this rule; (3) the subjects of this kingdom taken collectively, or the Church.  </p>[J] indicates this entry was also found in Jack Van Impe's Prophecy Dictionary<br/>
Kingly office of Christ	<p>one of the three special relations in which Christ stands to his people. Christ's office as mediator comprehends three different functions, viz., those of a prophet, priest, and king. These are not three distinct offices, but three functions of the one office of mediator. </p><p> Christ is King and sovereign Head over his Church and over all things to his Church ( Ephesians 1:22 ;  4:15 ;  Colossians 1:18 ;  2:19 ). He executes this mediatorial kingship in his Church, and over his Church, and over all things in behalf of his Church. This royalty differs from that which essentially belongs to him as God, for it is given to him by the Father as the reward of his obedience and sufferings (Phil  2:6-11 ), and has as its especial object the upbuilding and the glory of his redeemed Church. It attaches, moreover, not to his divine nature as such, but to his person as God-man.  </p><p> Christ's mediatorial kingdom may be regarded as comprehending, (1) his kingdom of power, or his providential government of the universe; (2) his kingdom of grace, which is wholly spiritual in its subjects and administration; and (3) his kingdom of glory, which is the consummation of all his providential and gracious administration.  </p><p> Christ sustained and exercised the function of mediatorial King as well as of Prophet and Priest, from the time of the fall of man, when he entered on his mediatorial work; yet it may be said that he was publicly and formally enthroned when he ascended up on high and sat down at the Father's right hand ( Psalms 2:6 ;  Jeremiah 23:5 ;  Isaiah 9:6 ), after his work of humiliation and suffering on earth was "finished."  </p>
Kings dale	<p>mentioned only in  Genesis 14:17 ;  2 Sam  18:18 , the name given to "the valley of Shaveh," where the king of Sodom met Abram.  </p>
Kings, The Books of	<p>The two books of Kings formed originally but one book in the Hebrew Scriptures. The present division into two books was first made by the LXX., which now, with the Vulgate, numbers them as the third and fourth books of Kings, the two books of Samuel being the first and second books of Kings. </p><p> They contain the annals of the Jewish commonwealth from the accession of Solomon till the subjugation of the kingdom by Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians (apparently a period of about four hundred and fifty-three years). The books of Chronicles (q.v.) are more comprehensive in their contents than those of Kings. The latter synchronize with  1 Chronicles 282 -2Chr  36:21 . While in the Chronicles greater prominence is given to the priestly or Levitical office, in the Kings greater prominence is given to the kingly.  </p><p> The authorship of these books is uncertain. There are some portions of them and of Jeremiah that are almost identical, e.g.,  2 Kings 24:18-25  and  Jeremiah 52 ;  39:1-10 ;  40:7-41:10. . There are also many undesigned coincidences between Jeremiah and Kings ( 2 Kings 2123 -23 and  Jeremiah 7:15 ;  15:4 ;  19:3 , etc.), and events recorded in Kings of which Jeremiah had personal knowledge. These facts countenance in some degree the tradition that Jeremiah was the author of the books of Kings. But the more probable supposition is that Ezra, after the Captivity, compiled them from documents written perhaps by David, Solomon, Nathan, Gad, and Iddo, and that he arranged them in the order in which they now exist.  </p><p> In the threefold division of the Scriptures by the Jews, these books are ranked among the "Prophets." They are frequently quoted or alluded to by our Lord and his apostles ( Matthew 6:29 ;  12:42 ;  Luke 4:25 Luke 4:26 ;  10:4 ; Compare  2 Kings 4:29 ;  Mark 1:6 ; Compare  2 Kings 1:8 ;  Matthew 3:4 , etc.).  </p><p> The sources of the narrative are referred to (1) "the book of the acts of Solomon" ( 1 Kings 11:41 ); (2) the "book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah" ( 14:29 ;  1 Kings 15:7 1 Kings 15:23 , etc.); (3) the "book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel" ( 14:19 ;  15:31 ;  1 Kings 16:14 1 Kings 16:20 1 Kings 16:27 , etc.).  </p><p> The date of its composition was some time between B.C. 561, the date of the last chapter ( 2 Kings 25 ), when Jehoiachin was released from captivity by Evil-merodach, and B.C. 538, the date of the decree of deliverance by Cyrus.  </p>
Kinsman	<p>Heb. goel, from root meaning to redeem. The goel among the Hebrews was the nearest male blood relation alive. Certain important obligations devolved upon him toward his next of kin. </p><li> If any one from poverty was unable to redeem his inheritance, it was the duty of the kinsman to redeem it ( Leviticus 25:25 Leviticus 25:28 ;  Ruth 3:9 Ruth 3:12 ). He was also required to redeem his relation who had sold himself into slavery ( Leviticus 25:48 Leviticus 25:49 ).  <p> God is the Goel of his people because he redeems them ( Exodus 6:6 ;  Isaiah 43:1 ;  41:14 ;  Isaiah 44:6 Isaiah 44:22 ;  48:20 ;  Psalms 103:4 ;  Job 19:25 , etc.).  </p></li><li> The goel also was the avenger (q.v.) of blood ( Numbers 35:21 ) in the case of the murder of the next of kin.   </li>
Kir	<p>a wall or fortress, a place to which Tiglath-pileser carried the Syrians captive after he had taken the city of Damascus ( 2 Kings 16:9 ;  Amos 1:5 ;  9:7 ). ( Isaiah 22:6 ), who also was contemporary with these events, mentions it along with Elam. Some have supposed that Kir is a variant of Cush (Susiana), on the south of Elam.  </p>
Kir of Moab	<p> Isaiah 15:1 . The two strongholds of Moab were Ar and Kir, which latter is probably the Kir-haraseth ( 16:7 ) following.  </p>
Kir-haraseth	<p>built fortress, a city and fortress of Moab, the modern Kerak, a small town on the brow of a steep hill about 6 miles from Rabbath-Moab and 10 miles from the Dead Sea; called also Kir-haresh, Kir-hareseth, Kir-heres ( Isaiah 16:7 Isaiah 16:11 ;  Jeremiah 48:31 Jeremiah 48:36 ). After the death of Ahab, Mesha, king of Moab (see MOABITE STONE), threw off allegiance to the king of Israel, and fought successfully for the independence of his kingdom. After this Jehoram, king of Israel, in seeking to regain his supremacy over Moab, entered into an alliance with Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, and with the king of Edom. The three kings led their armies against Mesha, who was driven back to seek refuge in Kir-haraseth. The Moabites were driven to despair. Mesha then took his eldest son, who would have reigned in his stead, and offered him as a burnt-offering on the wall of the fortress in the sight of the allied armies. "There was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land." The invaders evacuated the land of Moab, and Mesha achieved the independence of his country ( 2 Kings 3:20-27 ).  </p>
Kirjath	<p>city, a city belonging to Benjamin ( Joshua 18:28 ), the modern Kuriet el-'Enab, i.e., "city of grapes", about 7 1/2 miles west-north-west of Jerusalem.  </p>
Kirjathaim	<p>two cities; a double city. </p><li> A city of refuge in Naphtali ( 1 Chronicles 6:76 ).  </li><li> A town on the east of Jordan ( Genesis 14:5 ;  Deuteronomy 2:9 Deuteronomy 2:10 ). It was assigned to the tribe of Reuben ( Numbers 32:37 ). In the time of ( Ezekiel 25:9 ) it was one of the four cities which formed the "glory of Moab" (Compare  Jeremiah 48:1 Jeremiah 48:23 ). It has been identified with el-Kureiyat, 11 miles south-west of Medeba, on the south slope of Jebel Attarus, the ancient Ataroth.   </li>
Kirjath-arba	<p>city of Arba, the original name of Hebron (q.v.), so called from the name of its founder, one of the Anakim ( Genesis 23:2 ;  35:27 ;  Joshua 15:13 ). It was given to Caleb by Joshua as his portion. The Jews interpret the name as meaning "the city of the four", i.e., of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Adam, who were all, as they allege, buried there.  </p>
Kirjath-huzoth	<p>city of streets,  Numbers 22:39 , a Moabite city, which some identify with Kirjathaim. Balak here received and entertained Balaam, whom he had invited from Pethor, among the "mountains of the east," beyond the Euphrates, to lay his ban upon the Israelites, whose progress he had no hope otherwise of arresting. It was probably from the summit of Attarus, the high place near the city, that the soothsayer first saw the encampments of Israel.  </p>
Kirjath-jearim	<p>city of jaars; i.e., of woods or forests, a Gibeonite town ( Joshua 9:17 ) on the border of Benjamin, to which tribe it was assigned ( Joshua 18:15 Joshua 18:28 ). The ark was brought to this place ( 1 Samuel 7:1 1 Samuel 7:2 ) from Beth-shemesh and put in charge of Abinadab, a Levite. Here it remained till it was removed by David to Jerusalem ( 2 Samuel 6:2 2 Samuel 6:3 2 Samuel 6:12 ;  1 Chronicles 15:1-29 ; Compare  Psalms 132 ). It was also called Baalah ( Joshua 15:9 ) and Kirjath-baal (60). It has been usually identified with Kuriet el-'Enab (i.e., "city of grapes"), among the hills, about 8 miles north-east of 'Ain Shems (i.e., Beth-shemesh). The opinion, however, that it is to be identified with 'Erma, 4 miles east of 'Ain Shems, on the edge of the valley of Sorek, seems to be better supported. (See KIRJATH .) </p><p> The words of  Psalms 132:6 , "We found it in the fields of the wood," refer to the sojourn of the ark at Kirjath-jearim. "Wood" is here the rendering of the Hebrew word <i> jaar</i> , which is the singular of <i> jearim</i> . </p>
Kirjath-sannah	<p>city of the sannah; i.e., of the palm(?),  Joshua 15:49 ; the same as Kirjath-sepher ( 15:16 ;  Judges 1:11 ) and Debir (q.v.), a Canaanitish royal city included in Judah ( Joshua 10:38 ;  15:49 ), and probably the chief seat of learning among the Hittites. It was about 12 miles to the south-west of Hebron.  </p>
Kirjath-sepher	<p>city of books,  Joshua 15:15 ; same as Kirjath-sannah (q.v.), now represented by the valley of ed-Dhaberiyeh, south-west of Hebron. The name of this town is an evidence that the Canaanites were acquainted with writing and books. "The town probably contained a noted school, or was the site of an oracle and the residence of some learned priest." The "books" were probably engraved stones or bricks.  </p>
Kish	<p>a bow. </p><li> A Levite of the family of Merari ( 1 Chronicles 23:21 ;  24:29 ).  </li><li> A Benjamite of Jerusalem ( 1 Chronicles 8:30 ;  9:36 ).  </li><li> A Levite in the time of Hezekiah ( 2 Chronicles 29:12 ).  </li><li> The great-grandfather of Mordecai ( Esther 2:5 ).  </li><li> A Benjamite, the son of Abiel, and father of king Saul ( 1 Samuel 9:1 1 Samuel 9:3 ;  1 Samuel 10:11 1 Samuel 10:21 ;  14:51 ;  2 Sam  21:14 ). All that is recorded of him is that he sent his son Saul in search of his asses that had strayed, and that he was buried in Zelah. Called Cis,  Acts 13:21  (RSV, Kish).   </li>
Kishion	<p>hardness, a city of Issachar assigned to the Gershonite Levites ( Joshua 19:20 ), the same as Kishon ( 21:28 ).  </p>
Kishon	<p>winding, a winter torrent of Central Palestine, which rises about the roots of Tabor and Gilboa, and passing in a northerly direction through the plains of Esdraelon and Acre, falls into the Mediterranean at the north-eastern corner of the bay of Acre, at the foot of Carmel. It is the drain by which the waters of the plain of Esdraelon and of the mountains that surround it find their way to the sea. It bears the modern name of Nahr el-Mokattah, i.e., "the river of slaughter" (Compare  1 Kings 18:40 ). In the triumphal song of Deborah ( Judges 5:21 ) it is spoken of as "that ancient river," either (1) because it had flowed on for ages, or (2), according to the Targum, because it was "the torrent in which were shown signs and wonders to Israel of old;" or (3) probably the reference is to the exploits in that region among the ancient Canaanites, for the adjoining plain of Esdraelon was the great battle-field of Palestine.  </p><p> This was the scene of the defeat of Sisera ( Judges 4:7 Judges 4:13 ), and of the destruction of the prophets of Baal by Elijah ( 1 Kings 18:40 ). "When the Kishon was at its height, it would be, partly on account of its quicksands, as impassable as the ocean itself to a retreating army." (See DEBORAH .) </p>
Kiss	<p>of affection ( Genesis 27:26 Genesis 27:27 ;  29:13 ;  Luke 7:38 Luke 7:45 ); reconciliation ( Genesis 33:4 ;  2 Sam  <span class="badLink">14:33</span> ); leave-taking ( Genesis 31:28 Genesis 31:55 ;  Ruth 1:14 ;  2 Sam  <span class="badLink">19:39</span> ); homage ( Psalms 2:12 ;  1 Samuel 10:1 ); spoken of as between parents and children ( Genesis 27:26 ;  Genesis 31:28 Genesis 31:55 ;  48:10 ;  50:1 ;  Exodus 18:7 ;  Ruth 1:9 Ruth 1:14 ); between male relatives ( Genesis 29:13 ;  33:4 ;  45:15 ). It accompanied social worship as a symbol of brotherly love ( Romans 16:16 ;  1 Corinthians 16:20 ;  2 co  13:12 ;  1 Thessalonians 5:26 ;  1 Peter 5:14 ). The worship of idols was by kissing the image or the hand toward the image ( 1 Kings 19:18 ;  Hosea 13:2 ).  </p>
Kite	<p>an unclean and keen-sighted bird of prey ( Leviticus 11:14 ;  Deuteronomy 14:13 ). The Hebrew word used, <i> 'ayet</i> , is rendered "vulture" in  Job 28:7  in Authorized Version, "falcon" in Revised Version. It is probably the red kite (Milvus regalis), a bird of piercing sight and of soaring habits found all over Palestine.  </p>
Kithlish	<p>a man's wall, a town in the plain of Judah ( Joshua 15:40 ). It has been identified with Jelameh.  </p>
Kitron	<p>knotty, a city of Zebulun ( Judges 1:30 ), called also Kattath ( Joshua 19:15 ); supposed to be "Cana of Galilee."  </p>
Kittim	<p>( Genesis 10:4 ). (See CHITTIM .) </p>
Knead	<p>to prepare dough in the process of baking ( Genesis 18:6 ;  1 Samuel 28:24 ;  Hosea 7:4 ).  </p>
Kneading-trough	<p>the vessel in which the dough, after being mixed and leavened, was left to swell or ferment ( Exodus 8:3 ;  12:34 ;  Deuteronomy 28:5 Deuteronomy 28:7 ). The dough in the vessels at the time of the Exodus was still unleavened, because the people were compelled to withdraw in haste.  </p>
Knife	<p></p><li> Heb. hereb, "the waster," a sharp instrument for circumcision ( Joshua 5:2 Joshua 5:3 , lit. "knives of flint;" Compare  Exodus 4:25 ); a razor ( Ezekiel 5:1 ); a graving tool ( Exodus 20:25 ); an axe ( Ezekiel 26:9 ).  </li><li> Heb. maakeleth, a large knife for slaughtering and cutting up food ( Genesis 22:6 Genesis 22:10 ;  Proverbs 30:14 ).  </li><li> Heb. sakkin, a knife for any purpose, a table knife ( Proverbs 23:2 ).  </li><li> Heb. mahalaph, a butcher's knife for slaughtering the victims offered in sacrifice ( Ezra 1:9 ).  </li><li> Smaller knives (Heb. ta'ar,  Jeremiah 36:26 ) were used for sharpening pens. The pruning-knives mentioned in  Isaiah 18:5  (Heb. mizmaroth) were probably curved knives.   </li>
Knock	<p>"Though Orientals are very jealous of their privacy, they never knock when about to enter your room, but walk in without warning or ceremony. It is nearly impossible to teach an Arab servant to knock at your door. They give warning at the outer gate either by calling or knocking. To stand and call is a very common and respectful mode. Thus Moses commanded the holder of a pledge to stand without and call to the owner to come forth ( Deuteronomy 24:10 ). This was to avoid the violent intrusion of cruel creditors. Peter stood knocking at the outer door ( Acts 12:13 Acts 12:16 ), and the three men sent to Joppa by Cornelius made inquiry and 'stood before the gate' ( Acts 10:17 Acts 10:18 ). The idea is that the guard over your privacy is to be placed at the entrance."  </p><p> Knocking is used as a sign of importunity ( Matthew 7:7 Matthew 7:8 ;  Luke 13:25 ), and of the coming of Christ ( Luke 12:36 ;  Revelation 3:20 ).  </p>
Knop	<p>some architectural ornament. </p><li> Heb. kaphtor ( Exodus 25:31-36 ), occurring in the description of the candlestick. It was an ornamental swell beneath the cups of the candlestick, probably an imitation of the fruit of the almond.  </li><li> Heb. peka'im, found only in  1 Kings 6:18  and  7:24 , an ornament resembling a small gourd or an egg, on the cedar wainscot in the temple and on the castings on the brim of the brazen sea.   </li>
Koa	<p>he-camel, occurs only in  Ezekiel 23:23 , some province or place in the Babylonian empire, used in this passage along with Shoa (q.v.).  </p>
Kohath	<p>assembly, the second son of Levi, and father of Amram ( Genesis 46:11 ). He came down to Egypt with Jacob, and lived to the age of one hundred and thirty-three years ( Exodus 6:18 ).  </p>
Kohathites	<p>the descendants of Kohath. They formed the first of the three divisions of the Levites ( Exodus 6:16 Exodus 6:18 ;  Numbers 3:17 ). In the journeyings of the Israelites they had the charge of the most holy portion of the vessels of the tabernacle, including the ark ( Numbers 4 ). Their place in the marching and encampment was south of the tabernacle ( Numbers 3:29 Numbers 3:31 ). Their numbers at different times are specified ( 3:28 ;  4:36 ;  Numbers 26:57 Numbers 26:62 ). Samuel was of this division.  </p>
Korah	<p>ice, hail. </p><li> The third son of Esau, by Aholibamah ( Genesis 36:14 ;  1 Chronicles 1:35 ).  </li><li> A Levite, the son of Izhar, the brother of Amram, the father of Moses and Aaron ( Exodus 6:21 ). The institution of the Aaronic priesthood and the Levitical service at Sinai was a great religious revolution. The old priesthood of the heads of families passed away. This gave rise to murmurings and discontent, while the Israelites were encamped at Kadesh for the first time, which came to a head in a rebellion against Moses and Aaron, headed by Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. Two hundred and fifty princes, "men of renown" i.e., well-known men from among the other tribes, joined this conspiracy. The whole company demanded of Moses and Aaron that the old state of things should be restored, alleging that "they took too much upon them" ( Numbers 16:1-3 ). On the morning after the outbreak, Korah and his associates presented themselves at the door of the tabernacle, and "took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon." But immediately "fire from the Lord" burst forth and destroyed them all ( Numbers 16:35 ). Dathan and Abiram "came out and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children," and it came to pass "that the ground clave asunder that was under them; and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up." A plague thereafter began among the people who sympathized in the rebellion, and was only stayed by Aaron's appearing between the living and the dead, and making "an atonement for the people" ( 16:47 ).  <p> The descendants of the sons of Korah who did not participate in the rebellion afterwards rose to eminence in the Levitical service. </p> </li>
Korahites	<p>that portion of the Kohathites that descended from Korah. </p><li> They were an important branch of the singers of the Kohathite division ( 2 Chronicles 20:19 ). There are eleven psalms  Psalms 84 ;  85 ;  87 ;  88 ) dedicated to the sons of Korah.  </li><li> Some of the sons of Korah also were "porters" of the temple ( 1 Chronicles 9:17-19 ); one of them was over "things that were made in the pans" (31), i.e., the baking in pans for the meat-offering ( Leviticus 2:5 ).   </li>
Kore	<p>partridge. </p><li> A Levite and temple-warder of the Korahites, the son of Asaph. He was father of Shallum and Meshelemiah, temple-porters ( 1 Chronicles 9:19 ;  26:1 ).  </li><li> A Levitical porter at the east gate of the temple ( 2 Chronicles 31:14 ).  </li><li> In  1 Chronicles 26:19  the word should be "Korahites," as in the Revised Version.   </li>
Korhites	<p>a Levitical family descended from Korah ( Exodus 6:24 ;  1 Chronicles 12:6 ;  26:1 ;  2 Chr  <span class="badLink">20:19</span> ).  </p>
Koz	<p>thorn. </p><li> A descendant of Judah.  1 Chronicles 4:8 , "Coz;" RSV, "Hakkoz."  </li><li> A priest, the head of the seventh division of the priests ( Ezra 2:61 ;  Nehemiah 3:4 Nehemiah 3:21 ;  7:63 ). In  1 Chronicles 24:10  the word has the article prefixed, and it is taken as a part of the word "Hakkoz."   </li>
Libya	<p>the country of the Ludim ( Genesis 10:13 ), Northern Africa, a large tract lying along the Mediterranean, to the west of Egypt ( Acts 2:10 ). Cyrene was one of its five cities.  </p>
Lice	<p>(Heb. kinnim), the creatures employed in the third plague sent upon Egypt ( Exodus 8:16-18 ). They were miraculously produced from the dust of the land. "The entomologists Kirby and Spence place these minute but disgusting insects in the very front rank of those which inflict injury upon man. A terrible list of examples they have collected of the ravages of this and closely allied parasitic pests." The plague of lice is referred to in  Psalms 105:31 .  </p><p> Some have supposed that the word denotes not lice properly, but gnats. Others, with greater probability, take it to mean the "tick" which is much larger than lice. </p>
Lie	<p>an intentional violation of the truth. Lies are emphatically condemned in Scripture ( John 8:44 ;  1 Timothy 1:9 1 Timothy 1:10 ;  Revelation 21:27 ;  22:15 ). Mention is made of the lies told by good men, as by Abraham ( Genesis 12:12 Genesis 12:13 ;  20:2 ), Isaac ( 26:7 ), and Jacob ( 27:24 ); also by the Hebrew midwives ( Exodus 1:15-19 ), by Michal ( 1 Samuel 19:14 ), and by David ( 1 Samuel 20:6 ). (See ANANIAS .) </p>
Lieutenant	<p>(only in A.V.  Esther 3:12 ;  8:9 ;  9:3 ;  Ezra 8:36 ), a governor or viceroy of a Persian province having both military and civil power. Correctly rendered in the Revised Version "satrap."  </p>
Life	<p>generally of physical life ( Genesis 2:7 ;  Luke 16:25 , etc.); also used figuratively (1) for immortality ( Hebrews 7:16 ); (2) conduct or manner of life ( Romans 6:4 ); (3) spiritual life or salvation ( John 3:16 John 3:17 John 3:18 John 3:36 ); (4) eternal life ( Matthew 19:16 Matthew 19:17 ;  John 3:15 ); of God and Christ as the absolute source and cause of all life ( John 1:4 ;  John 5:26 John 5:39 ;  11:25 ;  12:50 ).  </p>
Light	<p>the offspring of the divine command ( Genesis 1:3 ). "All the more joyous emotions of the mind, all the pleasing sensations of the frame, all the happy hours of domestic intercourse were habitually described among the Hebrews under imagery derived from light" ( 1 Kings 11:36 ;  Isaiah 58:8 ;  Esther 8:16 ;  Psalms 97:11 ). Light came also naturally to typify true religion and the felicity it imparts ( Psalms 119:105 ;  Isaiah 8:20 ;  Matthew 4:16 , etc.), and the glorious inheritance of the redeemed ( Colossians 1:12 ;  Revelation 21:23-25 ). God is said to dwell in light inaccessible ( 1 Timothy 6:16 ). It frequently signifies instruction ( Matthew 5:16 ;  John 5:35 ). In its highest sense it is applied to Christ as the "Sun of righteousness" ( Malachi 4:2 ;  Luke 2:32 ;  John 1:7-9 ). God is styled "the Father of lights" ( James 1:17 ). It is used of angels ( 2 Corinthians 11:14 ), and of John the Baptist, who was a "burning and a shining light" ( John 5:35 ), and of all true disciples, who are styled "the light of the world" ( Matthew 5:14 ).  </p>
Lightning	<p>frequently referred to by the sacred writers ( Nahum 1:3-6 ). Thunder and lightning are spoken of as tokens of God's wrath ( 2 Samuel 22:15 ;  Job 28:26 ;  37:4 ;  Psalms 135:7 ;  144:6 ;  Zechariah 9:14 ). They represent God's glorious and awful majesty ( Revelation 4:5 ), or some judgment of God on the world ( 20:9 ).  </p>
Lign-aloes	<p>(only in pl., Heb. 'ahalim), a perfume derived from some Oriental tree ( Numbers 24:6 ), probably the agallochum or aloe-wood. (See ALOES).  </p>
Ligure	<p>(Heb. leshem) occurs only in  Exodus 28:19  and  39:12 , as the name of a stone in the third row on the high priest's breastplate. Some have supposed that this stone was the same as the jacinth (q.v.), others that it was the opal. There is now no mineral bearing this name. The "ligurite" is so named from Liguria in Italy, where it was found.  </p>
Lily	<p>The Hebrew name shushan or shoshan, i.e., "whiteness", was used as the general name of several plants common to Syria, such as the tulip, iris, anemone, gladiolus, ranunculus, etc. Some interpret it, with much probability, as denoting in the Old Testament the water-lily (Nymphoea lotus of Linn.), or lotus (Cant  Exodus 2:1 Exodus 2:2 ;  2:16 ;  4:5 ;  5:13 ;  Exodus 6:2 Exodus 6:3 ;  7:2 ). "Its flowers are large, and they are of a white colour, with streaks of pink. They supplied models for the ornaments of the pillars and the molten sea" ( 1 Kings 7:19 1 Kings 7:22 1 Kings 7:26 ;  2 Chr  4:5 ). In the Canticles its beauty and fragrance shadow forth the preciousness of Christ to the Church. Groser, however (Scrip. Nat. Hist.), strongly argues that the word, both in the Old and New Testaments, denotes liliaceous plants in general, or if one genus is to be selected, that it must be the genus Iris, which is "large, vigorous, elegant in form, and gorgeous in colouring."  </p><p> The lilies (Gr. krinia) spoken of in the New Testament ( Matthew 6:28 ;  Luke 12:27 ) were probably the scarlet martagon (Lilium Chalcedonicum) or "red Turk's-cap lily", which "comes into flower at the season of the year when our Lord's sermon on the mount is supposed to have been delivered. It is abundant in the district of Galilee; and its fine scarlet flowers render it a very conspicous and showy object, which would naturally attract the attention of the hearers" (Balfour's Plants of the Bible).  </p><p> Of the true "floral glories of Palestine" the pheasant's eye (Adonis Palestina), the ranunuculus (R. Asiaticus), and the anemone (A coronaria), the last named is however, with the greatest probability regarded as the "lily of the field" to which our Lord refers. "Certainly," says Tristram (Nat. Hist. of the Bible), "if, in the wondrous richness of bloom which characterizes the land of Israel in spring, any one plant can claim pre-eminence, it is the anemone, the most natural flower for our Lord to pluck and seize upon as an illustration, whether walking in the fields or sitting on the hill-side." "The white water-lily (Nymphcea alba) and the yellow water-lily (Nuphar lutea) are both abundant in the marshes of the Upper Jordan, but have no connection with the lily of Scripture." </p>
Lime	<p>The Hebrew word so rendered means "boiling" or "effervescing." From  Isaiah 33:12  it appears that lime was made in a kiln lighted by thorn-bushes. In  Amos 2:1  it is recorded that the king of Moab "burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime." The same Hebrew word is used in  Deuteronomy 27:2-4 , and is there rendered "plaster." Limestone is the chief constituent of the mountains of Syria.  </p>
Linen	<p></p><li> Heb., pishet, pishtah, denotes "flax," of which linen is made ( Isaiah 19:9 ); wrought flax, i.e., "linen cloth",  Leviticus 13:47 Leviticus 13:48 Leviticus 13:52 Leviticus 13:59 ;  Deuteronomy 22:11 .  <p> Flax was early cultivated in Egypt ( Exodus 9:31 ), and also in Palestine ( Joshua 2:6 ;  Hosea 2:9 ). Various articles were made of it: garments ( 2 Samuel 6:14 ), girdles ( Jeremiah 13:1 ), ropes and thread ( Ezekiel 40:3 ), napkins ( Luke 24:12 ;  John 20:7 ), turbans ( Ezekiel 44:18 ), and lamp-wicks ( Isaiah 42:3 ).  </p></li><li> Heb. buts, "whiteness;" rendered "fine linen" in  1 Chronicles 4:21 ;  15:27 ;  2 Chr  2:14 ;  3:14 ;  Esther 1:6 ;  8:15 , and "white linen"  2 Chronicles 5:12 . It is not certain whether this word means cotton or linen.  </li><li> Heb. bad; rendered "linen"  Exodus 28:42 ;  39:28 ;  Leviticus 6:10 ;  Leviticus 16:4 Leviticus 16:23 Leviticus 16:32 ;  1 Samuel 2:18 ;  2 Sam  6:14 , etc. It is uniformly used of the sacred vestments worn by the priests. The word is from a root signifying "separation."  </li><li> Heb. shesh; rendered "fine linen"  Exodus 25:4 ;  Exodus 26:1 Exodus 26:31 Exodus 26:36 , etc. In  Proverbs 31:22  it is rendered in Authorized Version "silk," and in Revised Version "fine linen." The word denotes Egyptian linen of peculiar whiteness and fineness (byssus). The finest Indian linen, the finest now made, has in an inch one hundred threads of warp and eighty-four of woof; while the Egyptian had sometimes one hundred and forty in the warp and sixty-four in the woof. This was the usual dress of the Egyptian priest. Pharaoh arrayed Joseph in a dress of linen ( Genesis 41:42 ).  </li><li> Heb. 'etun.  Proverbs 7:16 , "fine linen of Egypt;" in Revised Version, "the yarn of Egypt."  </li><li> Heb. sadin.  Proverbs 31:24 , "fine linen;" in Revised Version, "linen garments" ( Judges 14:12 Judges 14:13 ;  Isaiah 3:23 ). From this Hebrew word is probably derived the Greek word sindon, rendered "linen" in  Mark 14:51 Mark 14:52 ;  15:46 ;  Matthew 27:59 .  <p> The word "linen" is used as an emblem of moral purity ( Revelation 15:6 ). In  Luke 16:19  it is mentioned as a mark of luxury.  </p> </li>
Linen-yarn	<p>(See YARN .) </p>
Lines	<p>were used for measuring and dividing land; and hence the word came to denote a portion or inheritance measured out; a possession ( Psalms 16:6 ).  </p>
Lintel	<p></p><li> Heb. mashkoph, a projecting cover ( Exodus 12:22 Exodus 12:23 ; ver. 7, "upper door post," but RSV "lintel"); the head-piece of a door, which the Israelites were commanded to mark with the blood of the paschal lamb.  </li><li> Heb. kaphtar.  Amos 9:1 ;  Zephaniah 2:14  (RSV correctly "chapiters," as in A.V. marg.).   </li>
Lions	<p>the most powerful of all carnivorous animals. Although not now found in Palestine, they must have been in ancient times very numerous there. They had their lairs in the forests ( Jeremiah 5:6 ;  12:8 ;  Amos 3:4 ), in the caves of the mountains (Cant  4:8 ;  Nahum 2:12 ), and in the canebrakes on the banks of the Jordan ( Jeremiah 49:19 ;  50:44 ;  Zechariah 11:3 ).  </p><p> No fewer than at least six different words are used in the Old Testament for the lion. </p><li> <i> Gor</i> (i.e., a "suckling"), the lion's whelp ( Genesis 49:9 ;  Jeremiah 51:38 , etc.). </li><li> <i> Kephir</i> (i.e., "shaggy"), the young lion ( Judges 14:5 ;  Job 4:10 ;  Psalms 91:13 ;  104:21 ), a term which is also used figuratively of cruel enemies ( Psalms 34:10 ;  35:17 ;  58:6 ;  Jeremiah 2:15 ). </li><li> <i> 'Ari</i> (i.e., the "puller" in pieces), denoting the lion in general, without reference to age or sex ( Numbers 23:24 ;  2 Sam  17:10 , etc.). </li><li> <i> Shahal</i> (the "roarer"), the mature lion ( Job 4:10 ;  Psalms 91:13 ;  Proverbs 26:13 ;  Hosea 5:14 ). </li><li> <i> Laish</i> , so called from its strength and bravery ( Job 4:11 ;  Proverbs 30:30 ;  Isaiah 30:6 ). The capital of Northern Dan received its name from this word. </li><li> <i> Labi</i> , from a root meaning "to roar," a grown lion or lioness ( Genesis 49:9 ;  Numbers 23:24 ;  24:9 ;  Ezekiel 19:2 ;  Nahum 2:11 ).  <p> The lion of Palestine was properly of the Asiatic variety, distinguished from the African variety, which is larger. Yet it not only attacked flocks in the presence of the shepherd, but also laid waste towns and villages ( 2 Kings 17:25 2 Kings 17:26 ) and devoured men ( 1 Kings 13:24 1 Kings 13:25 ). Shepherds sometimes, single-handed, encountered lions and slew them ( 1 Samuel 17:34 1 Samuel 17:35 ;  Amos 3:12 ). Samson seized a young lion with his hands and "rent him as he would have rent a kid" ( Judges 14:5 Judges 14:6 ). The strength ( Judges 14:18 ), courage ( 2 Samuel 17:10 ), and ferocity ( Genesis 49:9 ) of the lion were proverbial.  </p> </li>
Lip	<p>besides its literal sense ( Isaiah 37:29 , etc.), is used in the original (saphah) metaphorically for an edge or border, as of a cup ( 1 Kings 7:26 ), a garment ( Exodus 28:32 ), a curtain ( 26:4 ), the sea ( Genesis 22:17 ), the Jordan ( 2 Kings 2:13 ). To "open the lips" is to begin to speak ( Job 11:5 ); to "refrain the lips" is to keep silence ( Psalms 40:9 ;  1 Peter 3:10 ). The "fruit of the lips" ( Hebrews 13:15 ) is praise, and the "calves of the lips" thank-offerings ( Hosea 14:2 ). To "shoot out the lip" is to manifest scorn and defiance ( Psalms 22:7 ). Many similar forms of expression are found in Scripture.  </p>
Litter	<p>(Heb. tsab, as being lightly and gently borne), a sedan or palanquin for the conveyance of persons of rank ( Isaiah 66:20 ). In  Numbers 7:3 , the words "covered wagons" are more literally "carts of the litter kind." There they denote large and commodious vehicles drawn by oxen, and fitted for transporting the furniture of the temple.  </p>
Liver	<p>(Heb. kabhed, "heavy;" hence the liver, as being the heaviest of the viscera,  Exodus 29:13 Exodus 29:22 ;  Leviticus 3:4 Leviticus 3:1 Leviticus 3:10 Leviticus 3:15 ) was burnt upon the altar, and not used as sacrificial food. In  Ezekiel 21:21  there is allusion, in the statement that the king of Babylon "looked upon the liver," to one of the most ancient of all modes of divination. The first recorded instance of divination (q.v.) is that of the teraphim of Laban. By the teraphim the LXX. and Josephus understood "the liver of goats." By the "caul above the liver," in  Leviticus 4:9 ;  7:4 , etc., some understand the great lobe of the liver itself.  </p>
Living creatures	<p>as represented by Ezekiel (1-10) and John ( Revelation 4 , etc.), are the cherubim. They are distinguished from angels ( Revelation 15:7 ); they join the elders in the "new song" ( Revelation 5:8 Revelation 5:9 ); they warn of danger from divine justice ( Isaiah 6:3-5 ), and deliver the commission to those who execute it ( Ezekiel 10:2 Ezekiel 10:7 ); they associate with the elders in their sympathy with the hundred and forty-four thousand who sing the new song ( Revelation 14:3 ), and with the Church in the overthrow of her enemies ( 19:4 ).  </p><p> They are supposed to represent mercy, as distinguished from justice, mercy in its various instrumentalities, and especially as connected with the throne of God, the "throne of grace." </p>
Lizard	<p>Only in  Leviticus 11:30 , as rendering of Hebrew <i> letaah</i> , so called from its "hiding." Supposed to be the Lacerta gecko or fan-foot lizard, from the toes of which poison exudes. (See CHAMELEON .) </p>
Lo-ammi	<p>not my people, a symbolical name given by God's command to Hosea's second son in token of Jehovah's rejection of his people ( Hosea 1:9 Hosea 1:10 ), his treatment of them as a foreign people. This Hebrew word is rendered by "not my people" in ver. 10;  2:23 .  </p>
Loan	<p>The Mosaic law required that when an Israelite needed to borrow, what he asked was to be freely lent to him, and no interest was to be charged, although interest might be taken of a foreigner ( Exodus 22:25 ;  Deuteronomy 23:19 Deuteronomy 23:20 ;  Leviticus 25:35-38 ). At the end of seven years all debts were remitted. Of a foreigner the loan might, however, be exacted. At a later period of the Hebrew commonwealth, when commerce increased, the practice of exacting usury or interest on loans, and of suretiship in the commercial sense, grew up. Yet the exaction of it from a Hebrew was regarded as discreditable ( Psalms 15:5 ;  Proverbs 6:1 Proverbs 6:4 ;  11:15 ;  17:18 ;  20:16 ;  27:13 ;  Jeremiah 15:10 ).  </p><p> Limitations are prescribed by the law to the taking of a pledge from the borrower. The outer garment in which a man slept at night, if taken in pledge, was to be returned before sunset ( Exodus 22:26 Exodus 22:27 ;  Deuteronomy 24:12 Deuteronomy 24:13 ). A widow's garment ( Deuteronomy 24:17 ) and a millstone (6) could not be taken. A creditor could not enter the house to reclaim a pledge, but must remain outside till the borrower brought it (10,11). The Hebrew debtor could not be retained in bondage longer than the seventh year, or at farthest the year of jubilee ( Exodus 21:2 ;  Leviticus 25:39 Leviticus 25:42 ), but foreign sojourners were to be "bondmen for ever" ( Leviticus 25:44-54 ).  </p>
Lock	<p>The Hebrews usually secured their doors by bars of wood or iron ( Isaiah 45:2 ;  1 Kings 4:3 ). These were the locks originally used, and were opened and shut by large keys applied through an opening in the outside ( Judges 3:24 ). (See KEY .) </p><p> Lock of hair ( Judges 16:13 Judges 16:19 ;  Ezekiel 8:3 ;  Numbers 6:5 , etc.).  </p>
Locust	<p>There are ten Hebrew words used in Scripture to signify locust. In the New Testament locusts are mentioned as forming part of the food of John the Baptist ( Matthew 3:4 ;  Mark 1:6 ). By the Mosaic law they were reckoned "clean," so that he could lawfully eat them. The name also occurs in  Revelation 9:3 Revelation 9:7 , in allusion to this Oriental devastating insect.  </p><p> Locusts belong to the class of Orthoptera, i.e., straight-winged. They are of many species. The ordinary Syrian locust resembles the grasshopper, but is larger and more destructive. "The legs and thighs of these insects are so powerful that they can leap to a height of two hundred times the length of their bodies. When so raised they spread their wings and fly so close together as to appear like one compact moving mass." Locusts are prepared as food in various ways. Sometimes they are pounded, and then mixed with flour and water, and baked into cakes; "sometimes boiled, roasted, or stewed in butter, and then eaten." They were eaten in a preserved state by the ancient Assyrians. </p><p> The devastations they make in Eastern lands are often very appalling. The invasions of locusts are the heaviest calamites that can befall a country. "Their numbers exceed computation: the hebrews called them 'the countless,' and the Arabs knew them as 'the darkeners of the sun.' Unable to guide their own flight, though capable of crossing large spaces, they are at the mercy of the wind, which bears them as blind instruments of Providence to the doomed region given over to them for the time. Innumerable as the drops of water or the sands of the seashore, their flight obscures the sun and casts a thick shadow on the earth ( Exodus 10:15 ;  Judges 6:5 ;  7:12 ;  Jeremiah 46:23 ;  Joel 2:10 ). It seems indeed as if a great aerial mountain, many miles in breadth, were advancing with a slow, unresting progress. Woe to the countries beneath them if the wind fall and let them alight! They descend unnumbered as flakes of snow and hide the ground. It may be 'like the garden of Eden before them, but behind them is a desolate wilderness. At their approach the people are in anguish; all faces lose their colour' ( Joel 2:6 ). No walls can stop them; no ditches arrest them; fires kindled in their path are forthwith extinguished by the myriads of their dead, and the countless armies march on ( Joel 2:8 Joel 2:9 ). If a door or a window be open, they enter and destroy everything of wood in the house. Every terrace, court, and inner chamber is filled with them in a moment. Such an awful visitation swept over Egypt ( Exodus 10:1-19 ), consuming before it every green thing, and stripping the trees, till the land was bared of all signs of vegetation. A strong north-west wind from the Mediterranean swept the locusts into the Red Sea.", Geikie's Hours, etc., ii., 149.  </p>
Lo-debar	<p>no pasture, ( 2 Samuel 17:27 ), a town in Gilead not far from Mahanaim, north of the Jabbok ( 2 Samuel 9:4 2 Samuel 9:5 ). It is probably identical with Debir ( Joshua 13:26 ).  </p>
Lodge	<p>a shed for a watchman in a garden ( Isaiah 1:8 ). The Hebrew name <i> melunah</i> is rendered "cottage" (q.v.) in  Isaiah 24:20 . It also denotes a hammock or hanging-bed.  </p>
Log	<p>the smallest measure for liquids used by the Hebrews ( Leviticus 14:10 Leviticus 14:12 Leviticus 14:15 Leviticus 14:21 Leviticus 14:24 ), called in the Vulgate sextarius. It is the Hebrew unit of measure of capacity, and is equal to the contents of six ordinary hen's eggs=the twelfth part of a him, or nearly a pint.  </p>
Lois	<p>the maternal grandmother of Timothy. She is commended by Paul for her faith ( 2 Timothy 1:5 ).  </p>
Loop	<p>a knotted "eye" of cord, corresponding to the "taches" or knobs in the edges of the curtains of the tabernacle, for joining them into a continuous circuit, fifty to a curtain ( Exodus 26:4 Exodus 26:5 Exodus 26:10 Exodus 26:11 ).  </p>
Lord	<p>There are various Hebrew and Greek words so rendered. </p><li> Heb. Jehovah, has been rendered in the English Bible LORD, printed in small capitals. This is the proper name of the God of the Hebrews. The form "Jehovah" is retained only in  Exodus 6:3 ;  Psalms 83:18 ;  Isaiah 12:2 ;  26:4 , both in the Authorized and the Revised Version.  </li><li> Heb. 'adon, means one possessed of absolute control. It denotes a master, as of slaves ( Genesis 24:14 Genesis 24:27 ), or a ruler of his subjects ( 45:8 ), or a husband, as lord of his wife ( 18:12 ).  <p> The old plural form of this Hebrew word is <i> 'adonai</i> . From a superstitious reverence for the name "Jehovah," the Jews, in reading their Scriptures, whenever that name occurred, always pronounced it <i> 'Adonai</i> . </p></li><li> Greek kurios, a supreme master, etc. In the LXX. this is invariably used for "Jehovah" and "'Adonai."  </li><li> Heb. ba'al, a master, as having domination. This word is applied to human relations, as that of husband, to persons skilled in some art or profession, and to heathen deities. "The men of Shechem," literally "the baals of Shechem" ( Judges 9:2 Judges 9:3 ). These were the Israelite inhabitants who had reduced the Canaanites to a condition of vassalage ( Joshua 16:10 ;  17:13 ).  </li><li> Heb. seren, applied exclusively to the "lords of the Philistines" ( Judges 3:3 ). The LXX. render it by satrapies. At this period the Philistines were not, as at a later period ( 1 Samuel 21:10 ), under a kingly government. (See   Joshua 13:3 ;  1 Samuel 6:18 .) There were five such lordships, viz., Gath, Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron.   </li>
Lords day	<p>only once, in  Revelation 1:10 , was in the early Christian ages used to denote the first day of the week, which commemorated the Lord's resurrection. There is every reason to conclude that John thus used the name. (See SABBATH .) </p>
Lords Prayer	<p>the name given to the only form of prayer Christ taught his disciples ( Matthew 6:9-13 ). The closing doxology of the prayer is omitted by ( Luke 11:2-4 ), also in the RSV of  Matthew 6:13 . This prayer contains no allusion to the atonement of Christ, nor to the offices of the Holy Spirit. "All Christian prayer is based on the Lord's Prayer, but its spirit is also guided by that of His prayer in Gethsemane and of the prayer recorded  John 17 . The Lord's Prayer is the comprehensive type of the simplest and most universal prayer."  </p>
Lords Supper	<p>( 1 Corinthians 11:20 ), called also "the Lord's table" ( 10:21 ), "communion," "cup of blessing" ( 10:16 ), and "breaking of bread" ( Acts 2:42 ).  </p><p> In the early Church it was called also "eucharist," or giving of thanks (Compare  Matthew 26:27 ), and generally by the Latin Church "mass," a name derived from the formula of dismission, Ite, missa est, i.e., "Go, it is discharged."  </p><p> The account of the institution of this ordinance is given in  Matthew 26:26-29 ,  Mark 14:22-25 ,  Luke 22:19 Luke 22:20 , and  1 Corinthians 11:24-26 . It is not mentioned by John.  </p><p> It was designed, </p><li> To commemorate the death of Christ: "This do in remembrance of me." </li><li> To signify, seal, and apply to believers all the benefits of the new covenant. In this ordinance Christ ratifies his promises to his people, and they on their part solemnly consecrate themselves to him and to his entire service. </li><li> To be a badge of the Christian profession. </li><li> To indicate and to promote the communion of believers with Christ. </li><li> To represent the mutual communion of believers with each other.  <p> The elements used to represent Christ's body and blood are bread and wine. The kind of bread, whether leavened or unleavened, is not specified. Christ used unleavened bread simply because it was at that moment on the paschal table. Wine, and no other liquid, is to be used ( Matthew 26:26-29 ). Believers "feed" on Christ's body and blood, (1) not with the mouth in any manner, but (2) by the soul alone, and (3) by faith, which is the mouth or hand of the soul. This they do (4) by the power of the Holy Ghost. This "feeding" on Christ, however, takes place not in the Lord's Supper alone, but whenever faith in him is exercised.  </p><p> This is a permanent ordinance in the Church of Christ, and is to be observed "till he come" again. </p> </li>
Lo-ruhamah	<p>not pitied, the name of the prophet Hosea's first daughter, a type of Jehovah's temporary rejection of his people ( Hosea 1:6 ;  2:23 ).  </p>
Lot	<p>(Heb. goral, a "pebble"), a small stone used in casting lots ( Numbers 33:54 ;  Jonah 1:7 ). The lot was always resorted to by the Hebrews with strictest reference to the interposition of God, and as a method of ascertaining the divine will ( Proverbs 16:33 ), and in serious cases of doubt ( Esther 3:7 ). Thus the lot was used at the division of the land of Canaan among the serveral tribes ( Numbers 26:55 ;  34:13 ), at the detection of Achan ( Joshua 7:14 Joshua 7:18 ), the election of Saul to be king ( 1 Samuel 10:20 1 Samuel 10:21 ), the distribution of the priestly offices of the temple service ( 1 Chronicles 24:3 1 Chronicles 24:5 1 Chronicles 24:19 ;  Luke 1:9 ), and over the two goats at the feast of Atonement ( Leviticus 16:8 ). Matthias, who was "numbered with the eleven" ( Acts 1:24-26 ), was chosen by lot.  </p><p> This word also denotes a portion or an inheritance ( Joshua 15:1 ;  Psalms 125:3 ;  Isaiah 17:4 ), and a destiny, as assigned by God ( Psalms 16:5 ;  Daniel 12:13 ).  </p><p> Lot, (Heb. lot), a covering; veil, the son of Haran, and nephew of Abraham ( Genesis 11:27 ). On the death of his father, he was left in charge of his grandfather Terah (31), after whose death he accompanied his uncle Abraham into Canaan ( 12:5 ), thence into Egypt (10), and back again to Canaan ( 13:1 ). After this he separated from him and settled in Sodom ( 13:5-13 ). There his righteous soul was "vexed" from day to day ( 2 Peter 2:7 ), and he had great cause to regret this act. Not many years after the separation he was taken captive by Chedorlaomer, and was rescued by Abraham ( Genesis 14 ). At length, when the judgment of God descended on the guilty cities of the plain ( Genesis 19:1-20 ), Lot was miraculously delivered. When fleeing from the doomed city his wife "looked back from behind him, and became a pillar of salt." There is to this day a peculiar crag at the south end of the Dead Sea, near Kumran, which the Arabs call Bint Sheik Lot, i.e., Lot's wife. It is "a tall, isolated needle of rock, which really does bear a curious resemblance to an Arab woman with a child upon her shoulder." From the words of warning in  Luke 17:32 , "Remember Lot's wife," it would seem as if she had gone back, or tarried so long behind in the desire to save some of her goods, that she became involved in the destruction which fell on the city, and became a stiffened corpse, fixed for a time in the saline incrustations. She became "a pillar of salt", i.e., as some think, of asphalt. (See SALT .) </p><p> Lot and his daughters sought refuge first in Zoar, and then, fearing to remain there longer, retired to a cave in the neighbouring mountains ( Genesis 19:30 ). Lot has recently been connected with the people called on the Egyptian monuments Rotanu or Lotanu, who is supposed to have been the hero of the Edomite tribe Lotan.  </p>
Lotan	<p>coverer, one of the sons of Seir, the Horite ( Genesis 36:20 Genesis 36:29 ).  </p>
Love	<p>This word seems to require explanation only in the case of its use by our Lord in his interview with "Simon, the son of Jonas," after his resurrection ( John 21:16 John 21:17 ). When our Lord says, "Lovest thou me?" he uses the Greek word <i> agapas</i> ; and when Simon answers, he uses the Greek word <i> philo</i> , i.e., "I love." This is the usage in the first and second questions put by our Lord; but in the third our Lord uses Simon's word. The distinction between these two Greek words is thus fitly described by Trench:, "<i> Agapan</i> has more of judgment and deliberate choice; <i> philein</i> has more of attachment and peculiar personal affection. Thus the 'Lovest thou' (Gr. agapas) on the lips of the Lord seems to Peter at this moment too cold a word, as though his Lord were keeping him at a distance, or at least not inviting him to draw near, as in the passionate yearning of his heart he desired now to do. Therefore he puts by the word and substitutes his own stronger 'I love' (Gr. philo) in its room. A second time he does the same. And now he has conquered; for when the Lord demands a third time whether he loves him, he does it in the word which alone will satisfy Peter ('Lovest thou,' Gr. phileis), which alone claims from him that personal attachment and affection with which indeed he knows that his heart is full." </p><p> In  1 Corinthians 13  the apostle sets forth the excellency of love, as the word "charity" there is rendered in the Revised Version.  </p>
Lubims	<p>the inhabitants of a thirsty or scorched land; the Lybians, an African nation under tribute to Egypt ( 2 Chronicles 12:3 ;  16:8 ). Their territory was apparently near Egypt. They were probably the Mizraite Lehabim.  </p>
Lucas	<p>a friend and companion of Paul during his imprisonment at Rome; Luke (q.v.), the beloved physician ( Philemon 1:24 ;  Colossians 4:14 ).  </p>
Lucifer	<p>brilliant star, a title given to the king of Babylon ( Isaiah 14:12 ) to denote his glory.  </p>
Lucius	<p>of Cyrene, a Christian teacher at Antioch ( Acts 13:1 ), and Paul's kinsman ( Romans 16:21 ). His name is Latin, but his birthplace seems to indicate that he was one of the Jews of Cyrene, in North Africa.  </p>
Lucre	<p>from the Lat. lucrum, "gain."  1 Timothy 3:3 , "not given to filthy lucre." Some MSS. have not the word so rendered, and the expression has been omitted in the Revised Version.  </p>
Lud	<p></p><li> The fourth son of Shem ( Genesis 10:22 ;  1 Chronicles 1:17 ), ancestor of the Lydians probably.  </li><li> One of the Hamitic tribes descended from Mizraim ( Genesis 10:13 ), a people of Africa ( Ezekiel 27:10 ;  30:5 ), on the west of Egypt. The people called Lud were noted archers ( Isaiah 66:19 ; Compare  Jeremiah 46:9 ).   </li>
Ludim	<p>probably the same as Lud (2) (Compare  Genesis 10:13 ;  1 Chronicles 1:11 ). They are associated ( Jeremiah 46:9 ) with African nations as mercenaries of the king of Egypt.  </p>
Luhith	<p>made of boards, a Moabitish place between Zoar and Horonaim ( Isaiah 15:5 ;  Jeremiah 48:5 ).  </p>
Luke	<p>the evangelist, was a Gentile. The date and circumstances of his conversion are unknown. According to his own statement ( Luke 1:2 ), he was not an "eye-witness and minister of the word from the beginning." It is probable that he was a physician in Troas, and was there converted by Paul, to whom he attached himself. He accompanied him to Philippi, but did not there share his imprisonment, nor did he accompany him further after his release in his missionary journey at this time ( Acts 17:1 ). On Paul's third visit to Philippi ( Acts 20:5 Acts 20:6 ) we again meet with Luke, who probably had spent all the intervening time in that city, a period of seven or eight years. From this time Luke was Paul's constant companion during his journey to Jerusalem ( (20:6-21:18). ). He again disappears from view during Paul's imprisonment at Jerusalem and Caesarea, and only reappears when Paul sets out for Rome ( 27:1 ), whither he accompanies him ( Acts 28:2 Acts 28:12-16 ), and where he remains with him till the close of his first imprisonment ( Philemon 1:24 ;  Colossians 4:14 ). The last notice of the "beloved physician" is in  2 Timothy 4:11 .  </p><p> There are many passages in Paul's epistles, as well as in the writings of Luke, which show the extent and accuracy of his medical knowledge. </p>
Luke, Gospel according to	<p>was written by Luke. He does not claim to have been an eye-witness of our Lord's ministry, but to have gone to the best sources of information within his reach, and to have written an orderly narrative of the facts ( Luke 1:1-4 ). The authors of the first three Gospels, the synoptics, wrote independently of each other. Each wrote his independent narrative under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.  </p><p> Each writer has some things, both in matter and style, peculiar to himself, yet all the three have much in common. Luke's Gospel has been called "the Gospel of the nations, full of mercy and hope, assured to the world by the love of a suffering Saviour;" "the Gospel of the saintly life;" "the Gospel for the Greeks; the Gospel of the future; the Gospel of progressive Christianity, of the universality and gratuitousness of the gospel; the historic Gospel; the Gospel of Jesus as the good Physician and the Saviour of mankind;" the "Gospel of the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man;" "the Gospel of womanhood;" "the Gospel of the outcast, of the Samaritan, the publican, the harlot, and the prodigal;" "the Gospel of tolerance." The main characteristic of this Gospel, as Farrar (Cambridge Bible, Luke, Introd.) remarks, is fitly expressed in the motto, "Who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil" ( Acts 10:38 ; Compare  Luke 4:18 ). Luke wrote for the "Hellenic world." This Gospel is indeed "rich and precious."  </p><p> "Out of a total of 1151 verses, Luke has 389 in common with Matthew and Mark, 176 in common with Matthew alone, 41 in common with Mark alone, leaving 544 peculiar to himself. In many instances all three use identical language." (See MATTHEW; MARK;  GOSPELS .) </p><p> There are seventeen of our Lord's parables peculiar to this Gospel. (See List of Parables in Appendix.) Luke also records seven of our Lord's miracles which are omitted by Matthew and Mark. (See List of Miracles in Appendix.) The synoptical Gospels are related to each other after the following scheme. If the contents of each Gospel be represented by 100, then when compared this result is obtained:  </p><p> Mark has 7 peculiarities, 93 coincidences.   Matthew 42  peculiarities, 58 coincidences.   Luke 59  peculiarities, 41 coincidences.  </p><p> That is, thirteen-fourteenths of Mark, four-sevenths of Matthew, and two-fifths of Luke are taken up in describing the same things in very similar language. </p><p> Luke's style is more finished and classical than that of Matthew and Mark. There is less in it of the Hebrew idiom. He uses a few Latin words ( Luke 12:6 ;  7:41 ;  8:30 ;  11:33 ;  19:20 ), but no Syriac or Hebrew words except sikera, an exciting drink of the nature of wine, but not made of grapes (from Heb. shakar, "he is intoxicated",  Leviticus 10:9 ), probably palm wine.  </p><p> This Gospel contains twenty-eight distinct references to the Old Testament. </p><p> The date of its composition is uncertain. It must have been written before the Acts, the date of the composition of which is generally fixed at about 63 or 64 A.D. This Gospel was written, therefore, probably about 60 or 63, when Luke may have been at Caesarea in attendance on Paul, who was then a prisoner. Others have conjectured that it was written at Rome during Paul's imprisonment there. But on this point no positive certainty can be attained.  </p><p> It is commonly supposed that Luke wrote under the direction, if not at the dictation of Paul. Many words and phrases are common to both; e.g., compare: </p><p> Luke 4:22 ; with  Colossians 4:6 .   Luke 4:32 ; with  1 Corinthians 2:4 .   Luke 6:36 ; with  2 Corinthians 1:3 .   Luke 6:39 ; with  Romans 2:19 .   Luke 9:56 ; with  2 Corinthians 10:8 .   Luke 10:8 ; with  1 Corinthians 10:27 .   Luke 11:41 ; with  Titus 1:15 .   Luke 18:1 ; with  2 Thessalonians 1:11 .   Luke 21:36 ; with  Ephesians 6:18 .   Luke 22:19 Luke 22:20 ; with   1 Corinthians 11:23-29 .   Luke 24:46 ; with  Acts 17:3 .   Luke 24:34 ; with  1 Corinthians 15:5 .  </p>
Lunatic	<p>probably the same as epileptic, the symptoms of which disease were supposed to be more aggravated as the moon increased. In  Matthew 4:24  "lunatics" are distinguished from demoniacs. In  17:15  the name "lunatic" is applied to one who is declared to have been possessed. (See DAEMONIAC .) </p>
Lust	<p>sinful longing; the inward sin which leads to the falling away from God ( Romans 1:21 ). "Lust, the origin of sin, has its place in the heart, not of necessity, but because it is the centre of all moral forces and impulses and of spiritual activity." In  Mark 4:19  "lusts" are objects of desire.  </p>
Luz	<p>a nut-bearing tree, the almond. </p><li> The ancient name of a royal Canaanitish city near the site of Bethel ( Genesis 28:19 ;  35:6 ), on the border of Benjamin ( Joshua 18:13 ). Here Jacob halted, and had a prophetic vision. (See BETHEL .) </li><li> A place in the land of the Hittites, founded ( Judges 1:26 ) by "a man who came forth out of the city of Luz." It is identified with Luweiziyeh, 4 miles north-west of Banias.   </li>
Lycaonia	<p>an inland province of Asia Minor, on the west of Cappadocia and the south of Galatia. It was a Roman province, and its chief towns were Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe. The "speech of Lycaonia" ( Acts 14:11 ) was probably the ancient Assyrian language, or perhaps, as others think, a corrupt Greek intermingled with Syriac words. Paul preached in this region, and revisited it ( Acts 16:1-6 ;  18:23 ;  19:1 ).  </p>
Lycia	<p>a wolf, a province in the south-west of Asia Minor, opposite the island of Rhodes. It forms part of the region now called Tekeh. It was a province of the Roman empire when visited by Paul ( Acts 21:1 ;  27:5 ). Two of its towns are mentioned, Patara ( Acts 21:1 Acts 21:2 ) and Myra ( 27:5 ).  </p>
Lydda	<p>a town in the tribe of Ephraim, mentioned only in the New Testament ( Acts 9:32 Acts 9:35 Acts 9:38 ) as the scene of Peter's miracle in healing the paralytic AEneas. It lay about 9 miles east of Joppa, on the road from the sea-port to Jerusalem. In the Old Testament ( 1 Chronicles 8:12 ) it is called Lod. It was burned by the Romans, but was afterwards rebuilt, and was known by the name of Diospolis. Its modern name is Ludd. The so-called patron saint of England, St. George, is said to have been born here.  </p>
Lydia	<p></p><li> Ezekiel 30:5  (Heb. Lud), a province in the west of Asia Minor, which derived its name from the fourth son of Shem ( Genesis 10:22 ). It was bounded on the east by the greater Phrygia, and on the west by Ionia and the AEgean Sea.  </li><li> A woman of Thyatira, a "seller of purple," who dwelt in Philippi ( Acts 16:14 Acts 16:15 ). She was not a Jewess but a proselyte. The Lord opened her heart as she heard the gospel from the lips of Paul ( 16:13 ). She thus became the first in Europe who embraced Christianity. She was a person apparently of considerable wealth, for she could afford to give a home to Paul and his companions. (See THYATIRA .)  </li>
Lysanias	<p>tetrarch of Abilene ( Luke 3:1 ), on the eastern slope of Anti-Lebanon, near the city of Damascus.  </p>
Lysias, Claudius	<p>the chief captain (chiliarch) who commanded the Roman troops in Jerusalem, and sent Paul under guard to the procurator Felix at Caesarea ( Acts 21:31-38 ;  22:24-30 ). His letter to his superior officer is an interesting specimen of Roman military correspondence ( 23:26-30 ). He obtained his Roman citizenship by purchase, and was therefore probably a Greek. (See CLAUDIUS .) </p>
Lystra	<p>a town of Lycaonia, in Asia Minor, in a wild district and among a rude population. Here Paul preached the gospel after he had been driven by persecution from Iconium ( Acts 14:2-7 ). Here also he healed a lame man (8), and thus so impressed the ignorant and superstitious people that they took him for Mercury, because he was the "chief speaker," and his companion Barnabas for Jupiter, probably in consequence of his stately, venerable appearance; and were proceeding to offer sacrifices to them (13), when Paul earnestly addressed them and turned their attention to the true source of all blessings. But soon after, through the influence of the Jews from Antioch in Pisidia and Iconium, they stoned Paul and left him for dead ( 14:19 ). On recovering, Paul left for Derbe; but soon returned again, through Lystra, encouraging the disciples there to steadfastness. He in all likelihood visited this city again on his third missionary tour ( Acts 18:23 ). Timothy, who was probably born here ( 2 Timothy 3:10 2 Timothy 3:11 ), was no doubt one of those who were on this occasion witnesses of Paul's persecution and his courage in Lystra.  </p>
Merarites	<p>the descendants of Merari ( Numbers 26:57 ). They with the Gershonites and the Kohathites had charge of the tabernacle, which they had to carry from place to place ( Numbers 3:20 Numbers 3:33-37 ;  4:29-33 ). In the distribution of the oxen and waggons offered by the princes ( Numbers 7 ), Moses gave twice as many to the Merarites (four waggons and eight oxen) as he gave to the Gershonites, because the latter had to carry only the lighter furniture of the tabernacle, such as the curtains, hangings, etc., while the former had to carry the heavier portion, as the boards, bars, sockets, pillars, etc., and consequently needed a greater supply of oxen and waggons. This is a coincidence illustrative of the truth of the narrative. Their place in marching and in the camp was on the north of the tabernacle. The Merarites afterwards took part with the other Levitical families in the various functions of their office ( 1 Chronicles 23:6 1 Chronicles 23:21-23 ;  2 Chr  1 Chronicles 29:12 1 Chronicles 29:13 ). Twelve cities with their suburbs were assigned to them ( Joshua 21:7 Joshua 21:34-40 ).  </p>
Merathaim	<p>double rebellion, probably a symbolical name given to Babylon ( Jeremiah 50:21 ), denoting rebellion exceeding that of other nations.  </p>
Merchant	<p>The Hebrew word so rendered is from a root meaning "to travel about," "to migrate," and hence "a traveller." In the East, in ancient times, merchants travelled about with their merchandise from place to place ( Genesis 37:25 ;  Job 6:18 ), and carried on their trade mainly by bartering ( Genesis 37:28 ;  39:1 ). After the Hebrews became settled in Palestine they began to engage in commercial pursuits, which gradually expanded ( 49:13 ;  Deuteronomy 33:18 ; Judg.  5:17 ), till in the time of Solomon they are found in the chief marts of the world ( 1 Kings 9:26 ;  1 Kings 10:11 1 Kings 10:26 1 Kings 10:28 ;  22:48 ;  2 Chr.  1:16 ;  1 Kings 9:10 1 Kings 9:21 ). After Solomon's time their trade with foreign nations began to decline. After the Exile it again expanded into wider foreign relations, because now the Jews were scattered in many lands.  </p>
Mercurius	<p>the Hermes (i.e., "the speaker") of the Greeks ( Acts 14:12 ), a heathen God represented as the constant attendant of Jupiter, and the god of eloquence. The inhabitants of Lystra took Paul for this god because he was the "chief speaker."  </p>
Mercy	<p>compassion for the miserable. Its object is misery. By the atoning sacrifice of Christ a way is open for the exercise of mercy towards the sons of men, in harmony with the demands of truth and righteousness ( Genesis 19:19 ;  Exodus 20:6 ;  Exodus 34:6 Exodus 34:7 ;  Psalms 85:10 ;  Psalms 86:15 Psalms 86:16 ). In Christ mercy and truth meet together. Mercy is also a Christian grace ( Matthew 5:7 ;  18:33-35 ).  </p>
Mercy-seat	<p>(Heb. kapporeth, a "covering;" LXX. and N.T., hilasterion; Vulg., propitiatorium), the covering or lid of the ark of the covenant (q.v.). It was of acacia wood, overlaid with gold, or perhaps rather a plate of solid gold, 2 1/2 cubits long and 1 1/2 broad ( Exodus 25:17 ;  30:6 ;  31:7 ). It is compared to the throne of grace ( Hebrews 9:5 ;  Ephesians 2:6 ). The holy of holies is called the "place of the mercy-seat" ( 1 Chronicles 28:11 :  Leviticus 16:2 ).  </p><p> It has been conjectured that the censer (thumiaterion, meaning "anything having regard to or employed in the burning of incense") mentioned in  Hebrews 9:4  was the "mercy-seat," at which the incense was burned by the high priest on the great day of atonement, and upon or toward which the blood of the goat was sprinkled ( Leviticus 16:11-16 ; Compare  Numbers 7:89  and  Exodus 25:22 ).  </p>
Mered	<p>rebellion, one of the sons of Ezra, of the tribe of Judah ( 1 Chronicles 4:17 ).  </p>
Meremoth	<p>exaltations, heights, a priest who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel ( Nehemiah 12:3 ), to whom were sent the sacred vessels ( Ezra 8:33 ) belonging to the temple. He took part in rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem ( Nehemiah 3:4 ).  </p>
Meribah	<p>quarrel or strife. </p><li> One of the names given by Moses to the fountain in the desert of Sin, near Rephidim, which issued from the rock in Horeb, which he smote by the divine command, "because of the chiding of the children of Israel" ( Exodus 17:1-7 ). It was also called Massah (q.v.). It was probably in Wady Feiran, near Mount Serbal.  </li><li> Another fountain having a similar origin in the desert of Zin, near to Kadesh ( Numbers 27:14 ). The two places are mentioned together in  Deuteronomy 33:8 . Some think the one place is called by the two names ( Psalms 81:7 ). In smiting the rock at this place Moses showed the same impatience as the people ( Numbers 20:10-12 ). This took place near the close of the wanderings in the desert ( Numbers 20:1-24 ;  Deuteronomy 32:51 ).   </li>
Merib-baal	<p>contender with Baal, ( 1 Chronicles 8:34 ;  9:40 ), elsewhere called Mephibosheth ( 2 Samuel 4:4 ), the son of Jonathan.  </p>
Merodach	<p>death; slaughter, the name of a Babylonian god, probably the planet Mars ( Jeremiah 50:2 ), or it may be another name of Bel, the guardian divinity of Babylon. This name frequently occurs as a surname to the kings of Assyria and Babylon.  </p>
Merodach-baladan	<p>Merodach has given a son, ( Isaiah 39:1 ), "the hereditary chief of the Chaldeans, a small tribe at that time settled in the marshes at the mouth of the Euphrates, but in consequence of his conquest of Babylon afterwards, they became the dominant caste in Babylonia itself." One bearing this name sent ambassadors to Hezekiah (B.C. 721). He is also called Berodach-baladan ( 2 Kings 20:12 ;  2 Chr  20:31 ). (See HEZEKIAH .) </p>
Merom	<p>height, a lake in Northern Palestine through which the Jordan flows. It was the scene of the third and last great victory gained by Joshua over the Canaanites ( Joshua 11:5-7 ). It is not again mentioned in Scripture. Its modern name is Bakrat el-Huleh. "The Ard el-Huleh, the centre of which the lake occupies, is a nearly level plain of 16 miles in length from north to south, and its breadth from east to west is from 7 to 8 miles. On the west it is walled in by the steep and lofty range of the hills of Kedesh-Naphtali; on the east it is bounded by the lower and more gradually ascending slopes of Bashan; on the north it is shut in by a line of hills hummocky and irregular in shape and of no great height, and stretching across from the mountains of Naphtali to the roots of Mount Hermon, which towers up at the north-eastern angle of the plain to a height of 10,000 feet. At its southern extremity the plain is similarly traversed by elevated and broken ground, through which, by deep and narrow clefts, the Jordan, after passing through Lake Huleh, makes its rapid descent to the Sea of Galilee."  </p><p> The lake is triangular in form, about 4 1/2 miles in length by 3 1/2 at its greatest breadth. Its surface is 7 feet above that of the Mediterranean. It is surrounded by a morass, which is thickly covered with canes and papyrus reeds, which are impenetrable. Macgregor with his canoe, the Rob Roy, was the first that ever, in modern times, sailed on its waters. (See JORDAN .) </p>
Meronothite	<p>a name given to Jehdeiah, the herdsman of the royal asses in the time of David and Solomon ( 1 Chronicles 27:30 ), probably as one being a native of some unknown town called Meronoth.  </p>
Meroz	<p>a plain in the north of Palestine, the inhabitants of which were severely condemned because they came not to help Barak against Sisera ( Judges 5:23 : comp  21:8-10 ;  1 Samuel 11:7 ). It has been identified with Marassus, on a knoll to the north of Wady Jalud, but nothing certainly is known of it. Like Chorazin, it is only mentioned in Scripture in connection with the curse pronounced upon it.  </p>
Mesha	<p>middle district, Vulgate, Messa. </p><li> A plain in that part of the boundaries of Arabia inhabited by the descendants of Joktan ( Genesis 10:30 ).  </li><li> Heb. meysh'a, "deliverance," the eldest son of Caleb ( 1 Chronicles 2:42 ), and brother of Jerahmeel.  </li><li> Heb. id, a king of Moab, the son of Chemosh-Gad, a man of great wealth in flocks and herds ( 2 Kings 3:4 ). After the death of Ahab at Ramoth-Gilead, Mesha shook off the yoke of Israel; but on the ascension of Jehoram to the throne of Israel, that king sought the help of Jehoshaphat in an attempt to reduce the Moabites again to their former condition. The united armies of the two kings came unexpectedly on the army of the Moabites, and gained over them an easy victory. The whole land was devastated by the conquering armies, and Mesha sought refuge in his last stronghold, Kir-harasheth (q.v.). Reduced to despair, he ascended the wall of the city, and there, in the sight of the allied armies, offered his first-born son a sacrifice to Chemosh, the fire-god of the Moabites. This fearful spectacle filled the beholders with horror, and they retired from before the besieged city, and recrossed the Jordan laden with spoil ( 2 Kings 3:25-27 ).  <p> The exploits of Mesha are recorded in the Phoenician inscription on a block of black basalt found at Dibon, in Moab, usually called the "Moabite stone" (q.v.). </p> </li>
Meshach	<p>the title given to Mishael, one of the three Hebrew youths who were under training at the Babylonian court for the rank of Magi ( Daniel 1:7 ;  2:49 ;  3:12-30 ). This was probably the name of some Chaldean god.  </p>
Meshech	<p>drawing out, the sixth son of Japheth ( Genesis 10:2 ), the founder of a tribe ( 1 Chronicles 1:5 ;  Ezekiel 27:13 ;  Ezekiel 38:2 Ezekiel 38:3 ). They were in all probability the Moschi, a people inhabiting the Moschian Mountains, between the Black and the Caspian Seas. In  Psalms 120:5  the name occurs as simply a synonym for foreigners or barbarians. "During the ascendency of the Babylonians and Persians in Western Asia, the Moschi were subdued; but it seems probable that a large number of them crossed the Caucasus range and spread over the northern steppes, mingling with the Scythians. There they became known as Muscovs, and gave that name to the Russian nation and its ancient capital by which they are still generally known throughout the East"  </p>
Meshelemiah	<p>friendship of Jehovah, a Levite of the family of the Korhites, called also Shelemiah ( 1 Chronicles 9:21 ;  1 Chronicles 26:1 1 Chronicles 26:2 1 Chronicles 26:9 1 Chronicles 26:14 ). He was a temple gate-keeper in the time of David.  </p>
Meshillemoth	<p>requitals. </p><li> The father of Berechiah ( 2 Chronicles 28:12 ).  </li><li> A priest, the son of Immer ( Nehemiah 11:13 ).   </li>
Meshullam	<p>befriended. </p><li> One of the chief Gadites in Bashan in the time of Jotham ( 1 Chronicles 5:13 ).  </li><li> Grandfather of Shaphan, "the scribe," in the reign of Josiah ( 2 Kings 22:3 ).  </li><li> A priest, father of Hilkiah ( 1 Chronicles 9:11 ;  Nehemiah 11:11 ), in the reign of Ammon; called Shallum in  1 Chronicles 6:12 .  </li><li> A Levite of the family of Kohath ( 2 Chronicles 34:12 ), in the reign of Josiah.  </li><li> 1 Chronicles 8:17 .  </li><li> 1 Chronicles 3:19 .  </li><li> Nehemiah 12:13 .  </li><li> A chief priest ( Nehemiah 12:16 ).  </li><li> One of the leading Levites in the time of ( Ezra 8:16 ).  </li><li> A priest ( 1 Chronicles 9:12 ).  </li><li> One of the principal Israelites who supported Ezra when expounding the law to the people ( Nehemiah 8:4 ).   </li>
Meshullemeth	<p>friend, the wife of Manasseh, and the mother of Amon ( 2 Kings 21:19 ), Kings of Judah.  </p>
Mesopotamia	<p>the country between the two rivers (Heb. Aram-naharaim; i.e., "Syria of the two rivers"), the name given by the Greeks and Romans to the region between the Euphrates and the Tigris ( Genesis 24:10 ;  Deuteronomy 23:4 ;  Judges 3:8 Judges 3:10 ). In the Old Testament it is mentioned also under the name "Padan-aram;" i.e., the plain of Aram, or Syria ( Genesis 25:20 ). The northern portion of this fertile plateau was the original home of the ancestors of the Hebrews ( Genesis 11 ;  Acts 7:2 ). From this region Isaac obtained his wife Rebecca ( Genesis 24:10 Genesis 24:15 ), and here also Jacob sojourned ( 28:2-7 ) and obtained his wives, and here most of his sons were born ( 35:26 ;  46:15 ). The petty, independent tribes of this region, each under its own prince, were warlike, and used chariots in battle. They maintained their independence till after the time of David, when they fell under the dominion of Assyria, and were absorbed into the empire ( 2 Kings 19:13 ).  </p>
Mess	<p>a portion of food given to a guest ( Genesis 43:34 ;  2 Sam  11:8 ).  </p>
Messenger	<p>(Heb. mal'ak, Gr. angelos), an angel, a messenger who runs on foot, the bearer of despatches ( Job 1:14 ;  1 Samuel 11:7 ;  2 Chr.  36:22 ); swift of foot ( 2 Kings 9:18 ).  </p>
Messiah	<p>(Heb. mashiah), in all the thirty-nine instances of its occurring in the Old Testament, is rendered by the LXX. "Christos." It means anointed. Thus priests ( Exodus 28:41 ;  40:15 ;  Numbers 3:3 ), prophets ( 1 Kings 19:16 ), and kings ( 1 Samuel 9:16 ;  16:3 ;  2 Sam  12:7 ) were anointed with oil, and so consecrated to their respective offices. The great Messiah is anointed "above his fellows" ( Psalms 45:7 ); i.e., he embraces in himself all the three offices. The Greek form "Messias" is only twice used in the New Testament, in  John 1:41  and  4:25  (RSV, "Messiah"), and in the Old Testament the word Messiah, as the rendering of the Hebrew, occurs only twice ( Daniel 9:25 Daniel 9:26 ; RSV, "the anointed one").  </p><p> The first great promise ( Genesis 3:15 ) contains in it the germ of all the prophecies recorded in the Old Testament regarding the coming of the Messiah and the great work he was to accomplish on earth. The prophecies became more definite and fuller as the ages rolled on; the light shone more and more unto the perfect day. Different periods of prophetic revelation have been pointed out, (1) the patriarchal; (2) the Mosaic; (3) the period of David; (4) the period of prophetism, i.e., of those prophets whose works form a part of the Old Testament canon. The expectations of the Jews were thus kept alive from generation to generation, till the "fulness of the times," when Messiah came, "made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law." In him all these ancient prophecies have their fulfilment. Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah, the great Deliverer who was to come. (Compare  Matthew 26:54 ;  Mark 9:12 ;  Luke 18:31 ;  22:37 ;  John 5:39 ;  Acts 2 ;  16:31 ;  Acts 26:22 Acts 26:23 .)  </p>
Metheg-ammah	<p>bridle of the mother, a figurative name for a chief city, as in  2 Samuel 8:1 , "David took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of the Philistines" (RSV, "took the bridle of the mother-city"); i.e., subdued their capital or strongest city, viz., Gath ( 1 Chronicles 18:1 ).  </p>
Methusael	<p>champion of El; man of God, a descendant of Cain ( Genesis 4:18 ), so called, perhaps, to denote that even among the descendants of Cain God had not left himself without a witness.  </p>
Methuselah	<p>man of the dart, the son of Enoch, and grandfather of Noah. He was the oldest man of whom we have any record, dying at the age of nine hundred and sixty-nine years, in the year of the Flood ( Genesis 5:21-27 ;  1 Chronicles 1:3 ).  </p>
Mezahab	<p>water of gold, the father of Matred ( Genesis 36:39 ;  1 Chronicles 1:50 ), and grandfather of Mehetabel, wife of Hadar, the last king of Edom.  </p>
Miamin	<p>=Mijamin, from the right hand. </p><li> The head of one of the divisions of the priests ( 1 Chronicles 24:9 ).  </li><li> A chief priest who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel ( Nehemiah 12:5 ), called Mijamin ( 10:7 ) and Miniamin ( 12:17 ).   </li>
Mibhar	<p>choice, a Hagarene, one of David's warriors ( 1 Chronicles 11:38 ); called also Bani the Gadite ( 2 Samuel 23:36 ).  </p>
Mibsam	<p>fragrance. </p><li> One of Ishmael's twelve sons, and head of an Arab tribe ( Genesis 25:13 ).  </li><li> A son of Simeon ( 1 Chronicles 4:25 ).   </li>
Mibzar	<p>fortress, one of the Edomitish "dukes" descended from Esau ( Genesis 36:42 ;  1 Chronicles 1:53 ).  </p>
Micah	<p>a shortened form of Micaiah, who is like Jehovah? </p><li> A man of Mount Ephraim, whose history so far is introduced in Judg. 17, apparently for the purpose of leading to an account of the settlement of the tribe of Dan in Northern Palestine, and for the purpose also of illustrating the lawlessness of the times in which he lived (Judg. 18;  19:1-29 ;  21:25 ).  </li><li> The son of Merib-baal (Mephibosheth),  1 Chronicles 8:34 1 Chronicles 8:35 .  </li><li> The first in rank of the priests of the family of Kohathites ( 1 Chronicles 23:20 ).  </li><li> A descendant of Joel the Reubenite ( 1 Chronicles 5:5 ).  </li><li> "The Morasthite," so called to distinguish him from Micaiah, the son of Imlah ( 1 Kings 22:8 ). He was a prophet of Judah, a contemporary of Isaiah ( Micah 1:1 ), a native of Moresheth of Gath ( Micah 1:14 Micah 1:15 ). Very little is known of the circumstances of his life (Compare  Jeremiah 26:18 Jeremiah 26:19 ).   </li>
Micah, Book of	<p>the sixth in order of the so-called minor prophets. The superscription to this book states that the prophet exercised his office in the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. If we reckon from the beginning of Jotham's reign to the end of Hezekiah's (B.C. 759-698), then he ministered for about fifty-nine years; but if we reckon from the death of Jotham to the accession of Hezekiah (B.C. 743-726), his ministry lasted only sixteen years. It has been noticed as remarkable that this book commences with the last words of another prophet, "Micaiah the son of Imlah" ( 1 Kings 22:28 ): "Hearken, O people, every one of you."  </p><p> The book consists of three sections, each commencing with a rebuke, "Hear ye," etc., and closing with a promise, (1) ch. 1; 2; (2) ch. 3-5, especially addressed to the princes and heads of the people; (3) ch. 6-7, in which Jehovah is represented as holding a controversy with his people: the whole concluding with a song of triumph at the great deliverance which the Lord will achieve for his people. The closing verse is quoted in the song of Zacharias ( Luke 1:72 Luke 1:73 ). The prediction regarding the place "where Christ should be born," one of the most remarkable Messianic prophecies ( Micah 5:2 ), is quoted in  Matthew 2:6 .  </p><p> There are the following references to this book in the New Testament: </p><p> 5:2 , with  Matthew 2:6 ;  John 7:42 .   7:6 , with  Matthew 10:21 Matthew 10:35 Matthew 10:36 .   7:20 , with  Luke 1:72 Luke 1:73 .  </p>
Micaiah	<p>who is like Jehovah?, the son of Imlah, a faithful prophet of Samaria ( 1 Kings 22:8-28 ). Three years after the great battle with Ben-hadad ( 20:29-34 ), Ahab proposed to Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, that they should go up against Ramoth-Gilead to do battle again with Ben-hadad. Jehoshaphat agreed, but suggested that inquiry should be first made "at the word of Jehovah." Ahab's prophets approved of the expedition; but Jehoshaphat, still dissatisfied, asked if there was no other prophet besides the four hundred that had appeared, and was informed of this Micaiah. He was sent for from prison, where he had been confined, probably on account of some prediction disagreeable to Ahab; and he condemned the expedition, and prophesied that it would end, as it did, in disaster. We hear nothing further of this prophet. Some have supposed that he was the unnamed prophet referred to in  1 Kings 20:35-42 .  </p>
Micha	<p></p><li> 2 Samuel 9:12  =MICAH (2).  </li><li> The son of Zabdi, a Levite of the family of Asaph ( Nehemiah 11:17 Nehemiah 11:22 ).   </li>
Michael	<p>who is like God? </p><li> The title given to one of the chief angels ( Daniel 10:13 Daniel 10:21 ;  12:1 ). He had special charge of Israel as a nation. He disputed with Satan ( Jude 1:9 ) about the body of Moses. He is also represented as warning against "that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world" ( Revelation 12:7-9 ).  </li><li> The father of Sethur, the spy selected to represent Asher ( Numbers 13:13 ).  </li><li> 1 Chronicles 7:3 , a chief of the tribe of Issachar.  </li><li> 1 Chronicles 8:16 , a Benjamite.  </li><li> A chief Gadite in Bashan ( 1 Chronicles 5:13 ).  </li><li> A Manassite, "a captain of thousands" who joined David at Ziklag ( 1 Chronicles 12:20 ).  </li><li> A Gershonite Levite ( 1 Chronicles 6:40 ).  </li><li> The father of Omri ( 1 Chronicles 27:18 ).  </li><li> One of the sons of king Jehoshaphat ( 2 Chronicles 21:2 2 Chronicles 21:4 ). He was murdered by his brother Jehoram.   </li>
Michaiah	<p></p><li> The queen-mother of King Abijah ( 2 Chronicles 13:2 ). (See MAACAH [4]).  </li><li> One of those sent out by Jehoshaphat to instruct the people in the law ( 2 Chronicles 17:7 ).  </li><li> 2 Kings 22:12 .  </li><li> The son of Gemariah. He reported to the king's officers Jeremiah's prediction, which he had heard Baruch read ( Jeremiah 36:11 Jeremiah 36:13 ) from his father Gemariah's chamber in the temple.  </li><li> A Levite ( Nehemiah 12:35 ).  </li><li> A priest ( Nehemiah 12:41 ).   </li>
Michal	<p>rivulet, or who as God?, the younger of Saul's two daughters by his wife Ahinoam ( 1 Samuel 14:49 1 Samuel 14:50 ). "Attracted by the graces of his person and the gallantry of his conduct, she fell in love with David and became his wife" ( 18:20-28 ). She showed her affection for him by promoting his escape to Naioth when Saul sought his life ( 1 Samuel 19:12-17 . Compare  Psalms 59 . See TERAPHIM). After this she did not see David for many years. Meanwhile she was given in marriage to another man, Phalti or Phaltiel of Gallim ( 1 Samuel 25:44 ), but David afterwards formally reclaimed her as his lawful wife ( 2 Samuel 3:13-16 ). The relation between her and David soon after this was altered. They became alienated from each other. This happened on that memorable day when the ark was brought up in great triumph from its temporary resting-place to the Holy City. In David's conduct on that occasion she saw nothing but a needless humiliation of the royal dignity ( 1 Chronicles 15:29 ). She remained childless, and thus the races of David and Saul were not mixed. In  2 Samuel 21:8  her name again occurs, but the name Merab should probably be here substituted for Michal (Compare  1 Samuel 18:19 ).  </p>
Michmash	<p>something hidden, a town of Benjamin ( Ezra 2:27 ), east of Bethel and south of Migron, on the road to Jerusalem ( Isaiah 10:28 ). It lay on the line of march of an invading army from the north, on the north side of the steep and precipitous Wady es-Suweinit ("valley of the little thorn-tree" or "the acacia"), and now bears the name of Mukhmas. This wady is called "the passage of Michmash" ( 1 Samuel 13:23 ). Immediately facing Mukhmas, on the opposite side of the ravine, is the modern representative of Geba, and behind this again are Ramah and Gibeah.  </p><p> This was the scene of a great battle fought between the army of Saul and the Philistines, who were utterly routed and pursued for some 16 miles towards Philistia as far as the valley of Aijalon. "The freedom of Benjamin secured at Michmash led through long years of conflict to the freedom of all its kindred tribes." The power of Benjamin and its king now steadily increased. A new spirit and a new hope were now at work in Israel. (See SAUL .) </p>
Michmethah	<p>hiding-place, a town in the northern border of Ephraim and Manasseh, and not far west of Jordan ( Joshua 16:6 ;  17:7 ).  </p>
Michri	<p>prize of Jehovah, a Benjamite, the father of Uzzi ( 1 Chronicles 9:8 ).  </p>
Michtam	<p>writing; i.e., a poem or song found in the titles of  Psalms 16 ;  <span class="badLink">5660</span> -60. Some translate the word "golden", i.e., precious. It is rendered in the LXX. by a word meaning "tablet inscription" or a "stelograph." The root of the word means to stamp or grave, and hence it is regarded as denoting a composition so precious as to be worthy to be engraven on a durable tablet for preservation; or, as others render, "a psalm precious as stamped gold," from the word <i> kethem</i> , "fine or stamped gold." </p>
Middin	<p>measures, one of the six cities "in the wilderness," on the west of the Dead Sea, mentioned along with En-gedi ( Joshua 15:61 ).  </p>
Midian	<p>strife, the fourth son of Abraham by Keturah, the father of the Midianites ( Genesis 25:2 ;  1 Chronicles 1:32 ).  </p>
Midianite	<p>an Arabian tribe descended from Midian. They inhabited principally the desert north of the peninsula of Arabia. The peninsula of Sinai was the pasture-ground for their flocks. They were virtually the rulers of Arabia, being the dominant tribe. Like all Arabians, they were a nomad people. They early engaged in commercial pursuits. It was to one of their caravans that Joseph was sold ( Genesis 37:28 Genesis 37:36 ). The next notice of them is in connection with Moses' flight from Egypt ( Exodus 2:15-21 ). Here in Midian Moses became the servant and afterwards the son-in-law of Reuel or Jethro, the priest. After the Exodus, the Midianites were friendly to the Israelites so long as they traversed only their outlying pasture-ground on the west of the Arabah; but when, having passed the southern end of Edom, they entered into the land of Midian proper, they joined with Balak, the king of Moab, in a conspiracy against them ( Numbers 22:4-7 ). Balaam, who had been sent for to curse Israel, having utterly failed to do so, was dismissed by the king of Moab; nevertheless he still tarried among the Midianites, and induced them to enter into correspondence with the Israelites, so as to bring them into association with them in the licentious orgies connected with the worship of Baal-Peor. This crafty counsel prevailed. The Israelites took part in the heathen festival, and so brought upon themselves a curse indeed. Their apostasy brought upon them a severe punishment. A plague broke out amongst them, and more than twenty-four thousand of the people perished ( Numbers 25:9 ). But the Midianites were not to be left unpunished. A terrible vengeance was denounced against them. A thousand warriors from each tribe, under the leadership of Phinehas, went forth against them. The Midianites were utterly routed. Their cities were consumed by fire, five of their kings were put to death, and the whole nation was destroyed ( Joshua 13:21 Joshua 13:22 ). Balaam also perished by the sword, receiving the "wages of his unrighteousness" ( Numbers 31:8 ;  2 Pet  2:15 ). The whole of the country on the east of Jordan, now conquered by the Israelites (see SIHON; OG), was divided between the two tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh.  </p><p> Some two hundred and fifty years after this the Midianites had regained their ancient power, and in confederation with the Amalekites and the "children of the east" they made war against their old enemies the Israelites, whom for seven years they oppressed and held in subjection. They were at length assailed by Gideon in that ever-memorable battle in the great plain of Esdraelon, and utterly destroyed (Jud ( Judges 7 ). Frequent allusions are afterwards made to this great victory ( Psalms 83:10 Psalms 83:12 ;  Isaiah 9:4 ;  10:6 ). They now wholly pass away from the page of history both sacred and profane.  </p>
Midwife	<p>The two midwives mentioned in  Exodus 1:15  were probably the superintendents of the whole class.  </p>
Migdal-Edar	<p>tower of the flock, a place 2 miles south of Jerusalem, near the Bethlehem road ( Genesis 35:21 ). (See EDAR .) </p>
Migdal-el	<p>tower of God, a fortified city of Naphtali ( Joshua 19:38 ), supposed by some to be identical with Magdala (q.v.).  </p>
Migdal-gad	<p>tower of fortune, a town in the plains of Judah, probably the modern el-Mejdel, a little to the north-east of Ascalon ( Joshua 15:37 ).  </p>
Migdol	<p>tower. </p><li> A strongly-fortified place 12 miles from Pelusium, in the north of Egypt ( Jeremiah 44:1 ;  46:14 ). This word is rendered "tower" in  Ezekiel 29:10 , but the margin correctly retains the name Migdol, "from Migdol to Syene;" i.e., from Migdol in the north to Syene in the south, in other words, the whole of Egypt.  </li><li> A place mentioned in the passage of the Red Sea ( Exodus 14:2 ;  Numbers 33:7 Numbers 33:8 ). It is probably to be identified with Bir Suweis, about 2 miles from Suez.   </li>
Migron	<p>precipice or landslip, a place between Aiath and Michmash ( Isaiah 10:28 ). The town of the same name mentioned in  1 Samuel 14:2  was to the south of this.  </p>
Mikloth	<p>staves. </p><li> An officer under Dodai, in the time of David and Solomon ( 1 Chronicles 27:4 ).  </li><li> A Benjamite ( 1 Chronicles 8:32 ;  1 Chronicles 9:37 1 Chronicles 9:38 ).   </li>
Milaiai	<p>eloquent, a Levitical musician ( Nehemiah 12:36 ) who took part in the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem.  </p>
Mildew	<p>(the rendering of a Hebrew word meaning "to be yellow," yellowness), the result of cutting east winds blighting and thus rendering the grain unproductive ( Deuteronomy 28:22 ;  1 Kings 8:37 ;  2 Chr  6:28 ).  </p>
Mile	<p>(from Lat. mille, "a thousand;"  Matthew 5:41 ), a Roman measure of 1,000 paces of 5 feet each. Thus the Roman mile has 1618 yards, being 142 yards shorter than the English mile.  </p>
Miletus	<p>(Miletum,  2 Timothy 4:20 ), a seaport town and the ancient capital of Ionia, about 36 miles south of Ephesus. On his voyage from Greece to Syria, Paul touched at this port, and delivered that noble and pathetic address to the elders ("presbyters," ver. 28) of Ephesus recorded in  Acts 20:15-35 . The site of Miletus is now some 10 miles from the coast. (See EPHESIANS, EPISTLE  TO .) </p>
Milk	<p></p><li> Hebrew halabh, "new milk", milk in its fresh state (Judg.  4:19 ). It is frequently mentioned in connection with honey ( Exodus 3:8 ;  13:5 ;  Joshua 5:6 ;  Isaiah 7:15 Isaiah 7:22 ;  Jeremiah 11:5 ). Sheep ( Deuteronomy 32:14 ) and goats ( Proverbs 27:27 ) and camels ( Genesis 32:15 ), as well as cows, are made to give their milk for the use of man. Milk is used figuratively as a sign of abundance ( Genesis 49:12 ; Ezek.  25:4 ;  Joel 3:18 ). It is also a symbol of the rudiments of doctrine ( 1 Corinthians 3:2 ;  Hebrews 5:12 Hebrews 5:13 ), and of the unadulterated word of God ( 1 Peter 2:2 ).  </li><li> Heb. hem'ah, always rendered "butter" in the Authorized Version. It means "butter," but also more frequently "cream," or perhaps, as some think, "curdled milk," such as that which Abraham set before the angels ( Genesis 18:8 ), and which Jael gave to Sisera ( Judges 5:25 ). In this state milk was used by travellers ( 2 Samuel 17:29 ). If kept long enough, it acquired a slightly intoxicating or soporific power.  <p> This Hebrew word is also sometimes used for milk in general ( Deuteronomy 32:14 ;  Job 20:17 ).  </p> </li>
Mill	<p>for grinding corn, mentioned as used in the time of Abraham ( Genesis 18:6 ). That used by the Hebrews consisted of two circular stones, each 2 feet in diameter and half a foot thick, the lower of which was called the "nether millstone" ( Job 41:24 ) and the upper the "rider." The upper stone was turned round by a stick fixed in it as a handle. There were then no public mills, and thus each family required to be provided with a hand-mill. The corn was ground daily, generally by the women of the house ( Isaiah 47:1 Isaiah 47:2 ;  Matthew 24:41 ). It was with the upper stone of a hand-mill that "a certain woman" at Thebez broke Abimelech's skull ( Judges 9:53 , "a piece of a millstone;" literally, "a millstone rider", i.e., the "runner," the stone which revolves. Compare  2 Samuel 11:21 ). Millstones could not be pledged ( Deuteronomy 24:6 ), as they were necessary in every family.  </p>
Millennium	<p>a thousand years; the name given to the era mentioned in  Revelation 20:1-7 . Some maintain that Christ will personally appear on earth for the purpose of establishing his kingdom at the beginning of this millennium. Those holding this view are usually called "millenarians." On the other hand, it is maintained, more in accordance with the teaching of Scripture, we think, that Christ's second advent will not be premillennial, and that the right conception of the prospects and destiny of his kingdom is that which is taught, e.g., in the parables of the leaven and the mustard-seed. The triumph of the gospel, it is held, must be looked for by the wider and more efficient operation of the very forces that are now at work in extending the gospel; and that Christ will only come again at the close of this dispensation to judge the world at the "last day." The millennium will thus precede his coming.  </p>
Millet	<p>(Heb. dohan; only in  Ezekiel 4:9 ), a small grain, the produce of the Panicum miliaceum of botanists. It is universally cultivated in the East as one of the smaller corn-grasses. This seed is the cenchros of the Greeks. It is called in India warree, and by the Arabs dukhan, and is extensively used for food, being often mixed with other grain. In this country it is only used for feeding birds.  </p>
Millo	<p>(Heb. always with the article, "the" Millo). </p><li> Probably the Canaanite name of some fortification, consisting of walls filled in with earth and stones, which protected Jerusalem on the north as its outermost defence. It is always rendered Akra i.e., "the citadel", in the LXX. It was already existing when David conquered Jerusalem ( 2 Samuel 5:9 ). He extended it to the right and left, thus completing the defence of the city. It was rebuilt by Solomon ( 1 Kings 9:15 1 Kings 9:24 ;  11:27 ) and repaired by Hezekiah ( 2 Chronicles 32:5 ).  </li><li> In Jud 9:6,20it is the name of a rampart in Shechem, probably the "tower of Shechem" ( Judges 9:46 Judges 9:49 ).   </li>
Mincing	<p>(Heb. taphoph,  Isaiah 3:16 ), taking affectedly short and quick steps. Luther renders the word by "wag" or "waggle," thus representing "the affected gait of coquettish females."  </p>
Mine	<p>The process of mining is described in  Job 28:1-11 . Moses speaks of the mineral wealth of Palestine ( Deuteronomy 8:9 ).  Job 28:4  is rightly thus rendered in the Revised Version, "He breaketh open a shaft away from where men sojourn; they are forgotten of the foot [that passeth by]; they hang afar from men, they swing to and fro." These words illustrate ancient mining operations.  </p>
Minister	<p>one who serves, as distinguished from the master. </p><li> Heb. meshereth, applied to an attendant on one of superior rank, as to Joshua, the servant of Moses ( Exodus 33:11 ), and to the servant of Elisha ( 2 Kings 4:43 ). This name is also given to attendants at court ( 2 Chronicles 22:8 ), and to the priests and Levites ( Jeremiah 33:21 ;  Ezekiel 44:11 ).  </li><li> Heb. pelah ( Ezra 7:24 ), a "minister" of religion. Here used of that class of sanctuary servants called "Solomon's servants" in  Ezra 2:55-58  and  Nehemiah 7:57-60 .  </li><li> Greek leitourgos, a subordinate public administrator, and in this sense applied to magistrates ( Romans 13:6 ). It is applied also to our Lord ( Hebrews 8:2 ), and to Paul in relation to Christ ( Romans 15:16 ).  </li><li> Greek hyperetes (literally, "under-rower"), a personal attendant on a superior, thus of the person who waited on the officiating priest in the synagogue ( Luke 4:20 ). It is applied also to John Mark, the attendant on Paul and Barnabas ( Acts 13:5 ).  </li><li> Greek diaconos, usually a subordinate officer or assistant employed in relation to the ministry of the gospel, as to Paul and Apollos ( 1 Corinthians 3:5 ), Tychicus ( Ephesians 6:21 ), Epaphras ( Colossians 1:7 ), Timothy ( 1 Thessalonians 3:2 ), and also to Christ ( Romans 15:8 ).   </li>
Minni	<p>only in  Jeremiah 51:27 , as the name of a province in Armenia, which was at this time under the Median kings. Armenia is regarded by some as = Har-minni i.e., the mountainous country of Minni. (See ARMENIA .) </p>
Minnith	<p>distribution, an Ammonitish town ( Judges 11:33 ) from which wheat was exported to Tyre ( Ezekiel 27:17 ). It was probably somewhere in the Mishor or table-land on the east of Jordan. There is a gentle valley running for about 4 miles east of Dhiban called Kurm Dhiban, "the vineyards of Dibon." Tristram supposes that this may be the "vineyards" mentioned in Judg. (l.c.).  </p>
Minstrel	<p>( Matthew 9:23 ), a flute-player. Such music was a usual accompaniment of funerals. In  2 Kings 3:15  it denotes a player on a stringed instrument.  </p>
Mint	<p>(Gr. heduosmon, i.e., "having a sweet smell"), one of the garden herbs of which the Pharisees paid tithes ( Matthew 23:23 ;  Luke 11:42 ). It belongs to the labiate family of plants. The species most common in Syria is the Mentha sylvestris, the wild mint, which grows much larger than the garden mint (M. sativa). It was much used in domestic economy as a condiment, and also as a medicine. The paying of tithes of mint was in accordance with the Mosiac law ( Deuteronomy 14:22 ), but the error of the Pharisees lay in their being more careful about this little matter of the mint than about weightier matters.  </p>
Miracle	<p>an event in the external world brought about by the immediate agency or the simple volition of God, operating without the use of means capable of being discerned by the senses, and designed to authenticate the divine commission of a religious teacher and the truth of his message ( John 2:18 ;  Matthew 12:38 ). It is an occurrence at once above nature and above man. It shows the intervention of a power that is not limited by the laws either of matter or of mind, a power interrupting the fixed laws which govern their movements, a supernatural power.  </p><p> "The suspension or violation of the laws of nature involved in miracles is nothing more than is constantly taking place around us. One force counteracts another: vital force keeps the chemical laws of matter in abeyance; and muscular force can control the action of physical force. When a man raises a weight from the ground, the law of gravity is neither suspended nor violated, but counteracted by a stronger force. The same is true as to the walking of Christ on the water and the swimming of iron at the command of the prophet. The simple and grand truth that the universe is not under the exclusive control of physical forces, but that everywhere and always there is above, separate from and superior to all else, an infinite personal will, not superseding, but directing and controlling all physical causes, acting with or without them." God ordinarily effects his purpose through the agency of second causes; but he has the power also of effecting his purpose immediately and without the intervention of second causes, i.e., of invading the fixed order, and thus of working miracles. Thus we affirm the possibility of miracles, the possibility of a higher hand intervening to control or reverse nature's ordinary movements. </p><p> In the New Testament these four Greek words are principally used to designate miracles: </p><li> Semeion, a "sign", i.e., an evidence of a divine commission; an attestation of a divine message ( Matthew 12:38 Matthew 12:39 ;  Matthew 16:1 Matthew 16:4 ;  Mark 8:11 ;  Luke 11:16 ;  23:8 ;  John 2:11 John 2:18 John 2:23 ;  Acts 6:8 , etc.); a token of the presence and working of God; the seal of a higher power.  </li><li> Terata, "wonders;" wonder-causing events; portents; producing astonishment in the beholder ( Acts 2:19 ).  </li><li> Dunameis, "might works;" works of superhuman power ( Acts 2:22 ;  Romans 15:19 ;  2 th  2:9 ); of a new and higher power.  </li><li> Erga, "works;" the works of Him who is "wonderful in working" ( John 5:20 John 5:36 ).  <p> Miracles are seals of a divine mission. The sacred writers appealed to them as proofs that they were messengers of God. Our Lord also appealed to miracles as a conclusive proof of his divine mission ( John 5:20 John 5:36 ;  John 10:25 John 10:38 ). Thus, being out of the common course of nature and beyond the power of man, they are fitted to convey the impression of the presence and power of God. Where miracles are there certainly God is. The man, therefore, who works a miracle affords thereby clear proof that he comes with the authority of God; they are his credentials that he is God's messenger. The teacher points to these credentials, and they are a proof that he speaks with the authority of God. He boldly says, "God bears me witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles."  </p><p> The credibility of miracles is established by the evidence of the senses on the part of those who are witnesses of them, and to all others by the testimony of such witnesses. The witnesses were competent, and their testimony is trustworthy. Unbelievers, following Hume, deny that any testimony can prove a miracle, because they say miracles are impossible. We have shown that miracles are possible, and surely they can be borne witness to. Surely they are credible when we have abundant and trustworthy evidence of their occurrence. They are credible just as any facts of history well authenticated are credible. Miracles, it is said, are contrary to experience. Of course they are contrary to our experience, but that does not prove that they were contrary to the experience of those who witnessed them. We believe a thousand facts, both of history and of science, that are contrary to our experience, but we believe them on the ground of competent testimony. An atheist or a pantheist must, as a matter of course, deny the possibility of miracles; but to one who believes in a personal God, who in his wisdom may see fit to interfere with the ordinary processes of nature, miracles are not impossible, nor are they incredible. (See LIST OF MIRACLES, Appendix.) </p> </li>
Miriam	<p>their rebellion. </p><li> The sister of Moses and Aaron ( Exodus 2:4-10 ;  1 Chronicles 6:3 ). Her name is prominent in the history of the Exodus. She is called "the prophetess" ( Exodus 15:20 ). She took the lead in the song of triumph after the passage of the Red Sea. She died at Kadesh during the second encampment at that place, toward the close of the wanderings in the wilderness, and was buried there ( Numbers 20:1 ). (See AARON;  MOSES .) </li><li> 1 Chronicles 4:17 , one of the descendants of Judah.   </li>
Misdeem	<p>( Deuteronomy 32:27 , RSV). The Authorized Version reads, "should behave themselves strangely;" i.e., not recognize the truth, misunderstand or mistake the cause of Israel's ruin, which was due to the fact that God had forsaken them on account of their apostasy.  </p>
Misgab	<p>height, a town of Moab, or simply, the height=the citadel, some fortress so called; or perhaps a general name for the highlands of Moab, as some think ( Jeremiah 48:1 ). In  Isaiah 25:12 , the word is rendered "high fort."  </p>
Mishael	<p>who is like God! </p><li> A Levite; the eldest of the three sons of Uzziel ( Exodus 6:22 ).  </li><li> One of the three Hebrew youths who were trained with Daniel in Babylon ( Daniel 1:11 Daniel 1:19 ), and promoted to the rank of Magi. He and his companions were afterwards cast into the burning fiery furnace for refusing to worship the idol the king had set up, from which they were miraculously delivered ( 3:13-30 ). His Chaldean name was Meshach (q.v.).   </li>
Mishal	<p>a city of the tribe of Asher ( Joshua 21:30 ;  1 Chronicles 6:74 ). It is probably the modern Misalli, on the shore near Carmel.  </p>
Misham	<p>their cleansing or their beholding, a Benjamite, one of the sons of Elpaal ( 1 Chronicles 8:12 ).  </p>
Misheal	<p>( Joshua 19:26 ), a town of Asher, probably the same as Mishal.  </p>
Mishma	<p>hearing. </p><li> One of the sons of Ishmael ( Genesis 25:14 ), and founder of an Arab tribe.  </li><li> A Simeonite ( 1 Chronicles 4:25 1 Chronicles 4:26 ).   </li>
Mishmannah	<p>fatness, one of the Gadite heroes who gathered to David at Ziklag ( 1 Chronicles 12:10 ).  </p>
Misrephoth-maim	<p>burning of waters, supposed to be salt-pans, or lime-kilns, or glass-factories, a place to which Joshua pursued a party of Canaanites after the defeat of Jabin ( Joshua 11:8 ). It is identified with the ruin Musheirifeh, at the promontory of en-Nakhurah, some 11 miles north of Acre.  </p>
Mite	<p>contraction of minute, from the Latin minutum, the translation of the Greek word lepton, the very smallest bronze of copper coin ( Luke 12:59 ;  21:2 ). Two mites made one quadrans, i.e., the fourth part of a Roman as, which was in value nearly a halfpenny. (See FARTHING .) </p>
Mithcah	<p>sweetness, one of the stations of the Israelites in the wilderness ( Numbers 33:28 Numbers 33:29 ).  </p>
Mithredath	<p>given by Mithra, or dedicated to Mithra, i.e., the sun, the Hebrew form of the Greek name Mithridates. </p><li> The "treasurer" of King Cyrus ( Ezra 1:8 ).  </li><li> Ezra 4:7 , a Persian officer in Samaria.   </li>
Mitre	<p>(Heb. mitsnepheth), something rolled round the head; the turban or head-dress of the high priest ( Exodus 28:4 Exodus 28:37 Exodus 28:39 ;  29:6 , etc.). In the Authorized Version of  Ezekiel 21:26 , this Hebrew word is rendered "diadem," but in the Revised Version, "mitre." It was a twisted band of fine linen, 8 yards in length, coiled into the form of a cap, and worn on official occasions ( Leviticus 8:9 ;  16:4 ;  Zechariah 3:5 ). On the front of it was a golden plate with the inscription, "Holiness to the Lord." The mitsnepheth differed from the mitre or head-dress (migba'ah) of the common priest. (See BONNET .) </p>
Mitylene	<p>the chief city of the island of Lesbos, on its east coast, in the AEgean Sea. Paul, during his third missionary journey, touched at this place on his way from Corinth to Judea ( Acts 20:14 ), and here tarried for a night. It lies between Assos and Chios. It is now under the Turkish rule, and bears the name of Metelin.  </p>
Mixed multitude	<p>( Exodus 12:38 ), a class who accompanied the Israelites as they journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, the first stage of the Exodus. These were probably miscellaneous hangers-on to the Hebrews, whether Egyptians of the lower orders, or the remains of the Hyksos (see EGYPT; MOSES), as some think. The same thing happened on the return of the Jews from Babylon ( Nehemiah 13:3 ), a "mixed multitude" accompanied them so far.  </p>
Mizar	<p>smallness, a summit on the eastern ridge of Lebanon, near which David lay after escaping from Absalom ( Psalms 42:6 ). It may, perhaps, be the present Jebel Ajlun, thus named, "the little", in contrast with the greater elevation of Lebanon and Hermon.  </p>
Mizpah	<p>or Miz'peh, watch-tower; the look-out. </p><li> A place in Gilead, so named by Laban, who overtook Jacob at this spot ( Genesis 31:49 ) on his return to Palestine from Padan-aram. Here Jacob and Laban set up their memorial cairn of stones. It is the same as Ramath-mizpeh ( Joshua 13:26 ).  </li><li> A town in Gilead, where Jephthah resided, and where he assumed the command of the Israelites in a time of national danger. Here he made his rash vow; and here his daughter submitted to her mysterious fate ( Judges 10:17 ;  Judges 11:11 Judges 11:34 ). It may be the same as Ramoth-Gilead ( Joshua 20:8 ), but it is more likely that it is identical with the foregoing, the Mizpeh of  Genesis 31:23 Genesis 31:25 Genesis 31:48 Genesis 31:49 .  </li><li> Another place in Gilead, at the foot of Mount Hermon, inhabited by Hivites ( Joshua 11:3 Joshua 11:8 ). The name in Hebrew here has the article before it, "the Mizpeh," "the watch-tower." The modern village of Metullah, meaning also "the look-out," probably occupies the site so called.  </li><li> A town of Moab to which David removed his parents for safety during his persecution by Saul ( 1 Samuel 22:3 ). This was probably the citadel known as Kir-Moab, now Kerak. While David resided here he was visited by the prophet Gad, here mentioned for the first time, who was probably sent by Samuel to bid him leave the land of Moab and betake himself to the land of Judah. He accordingly removed to the forest of Hareth (q.v.), on the edge of the mountain chain of Hebron.  </li><li> A city of Benjamin, "the watch-tower", where the people were accustomed to meet in great national emergencies ( Joshua 18:26 ;  Judges 20:1 Judges 20:3 ;  Judges 21:1 Judges 21:5 ;  1 Samuel 7:5-16 ). It has been supposed to be the same as Nob ( 1 Samuel 21:1 ;  22:9-19 ). It was some 4 miles north-west of Jerusalem, and was situated on the loftiest hill in the neighbourhood, some 600 feet above the plain of Gibeon. This village has the modern name of Neby Samwil, i.e., the prophet Samuel, from a tradition that Samuel's tomb is here. (See NOB .) <p> Samuel inaugurated the reformation that characterized his time by convening a great assembly of all Israel at Mizpeh, now the politico-religious centre of the nation. There, in deep humiliation on account of their sins, they renewed their vows and entered again into covenant with the God of their fathers. It was a period of great religious awakening and of revived national life. The Philistines heard of this assembly, and came up against Israel. The Hebrews charged the Philistine host with great fury, and they were totally routed. Samuel commemorated this signal victory by erecting a memorial-stone, which he called "Ebenezer" (q.v.), saying, "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us" ( 1 Samuel 7:7-12 ).  </p> </li>
Mizpar	<p>number, one of the Jews who accompanied Zerubbabel from Babylon ( Ezra 2:2 ); called also Mispereth ( Nehemiah 7:7 ).  </p>
Mizraim	<p>the dual form of matzor, meaning a "mound" or "fortress," the name of a people descended from Ham ( Genesis 10:6 Genesis 10:13 ;  1 Chronicles 1:8 1 Chronicles 1:11 ). It was the name generally given by the Hebrews to the land of Egypt (q.v.), and may denote the two Egypts, the Upper and the Lower. The modern Arabic name for Egypt is Muzr.  </p>
Mizzah	<p>despair, one of the four sons of Reuel, the son of Esau ( Genesis 36:13 Genesis 36:17 ).  </p>
Mnason	<p>reminding, or remembrancer, a Christian of Jerusalem with whom Paul lodged ( Acts 21:16 ). He was apparently a native of Cyprus, like Barnabas ( Acts 11:19 Acts 11:20 ), and was well known to the Christians of Caesarea ( 4:36 ). He was an "old disciple" (RSV, "early disciple"), i.e., he had become a Christian in the beginning of the formation of the Church in Jerusalem.  </p>
Moab	<p>the seed of the father, or, according to others, the desirable land, the eldest son of Lot ( Genesis 19:37 ), of incestuous birth.  </p><li> Used to denote the people of Moab ( Numbers 22:3-14 ; Judg.  3:30 ;  2 Sam  8:2 ;  Jeremiah 48:11 Jeremiah 48:13 ).  </li><li> The land of Moab ( Jeremiah 48:24 ), called also the "country of Moab" ( Ruth 1:2 Ruth 1:6 ;  2:6 ), on the east of Jordan and the Dead Sea, and south of the Arnon ( Numbers 21:13 Numbers 21:26 ). In a wider sense it included the whole region that had been occupied by the Amorites. It bears the modern name of Kerak.  <p> In the Plains of Moab, opposite Jericho ( Numbers 22:1 ;  26:63 ;  Joshua 13:32 ), the children of Israel had their last encampment before they entered the land of Canaan. It was at that time in the possession of the Amorites ( Numbers 21:22 ). "Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah," and "died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord" ( Deuteronomy 34:5 Deuteronomy 34:6 ). "Surely if we had nothing else to interest us in the land of Moab, the fact that it was from the top of Pisgah, its noblest height, this mightiest of the prophets looked out with eye undimmed upon the Promised Land; that it was here on Nebo, its loftiest mountain, that he died his solitary death; that it was here, in the valley over against Beth-peor, he found his mysterious sepulchre, we have enough to enshrine the memory in our hearts."  </p> </li>
Moabite	<p>the designation of a tribe descended from Moab, the son of Lot ( Genesis 19:37 ). From Zoar, the cradle of this tribe, on the south-eastern border of the Dead Sea, they gradually spread over the region on the east of Jordan. Rameses II., the Pharaoh of the Oppression, enumerates Moab (Muab) among his conquests. Shortly before the Exodus, the warlike Amorites crossed the Jordan under Sihon their king and drove the Moabites ( Numbers 21:26-30 ) out of the region between the Arnon and the Jabbok, and occupied it, making Heshbon their capital. They were then confined to the territory to the south of the Arnon.  </p><p> On their journey the Israelites did not pass through Moab, but through the "wilderness" to the east ( Deuteronomy 2:8 ;  Judges 11:18 ), at length reaching the country to the north of the Arnon. Here they remained for some time till they had conquered Bashan (see SIHON; OG). The Moabites were alarmed, and their king, Balak, sought aid from the Midianites ( Numbers 22:2-4 ). It was while they were here that the visit of Balaam (q.v.) to Balak took place. (See MOSES .) </p><p> After the Conquest, the Moabites maintained hostile relations with the Israelites, and frequently harassed them in war (Judg.  3:12-30 ;  1 Samuel 14 ). The story of Ruth, however, shows the existence of friendly relations between Moab and Bethlehem. By his descent from Ruth, David may be said to have had Moabite blood in his veins. Yet there was war between David and the Moabites ( 2 Samuel 8:2 ;  23:20 ;  1 Chronicles 18:2 ), from whom he took great spoil ( 2 Samuel 8:2 2 Samuel 8:11 2 Samuel 8:12 ;  1 Chronicles 11:22 ;  18:11 ).  </p><p> During the one hundred and fifty years which followed the defeat of the Moabites, after the death of Ahab (see MESHA), they regained, apparently, much of their former prosperty. At this time ( Isaiah 15:1 ) delivered his "burden of Moab," predicting the coming of judgment on that land (Compare  2 Kings 17:3 ;  18:9 ;  1 Chronicles 5:25 1 Chronicles 5:26 ). Between the time of Isaiah and the commencement of the Babylonian captivity we have very seldom any reference to Moab ( Jeremiah 25:21 ;  27:3 ;  40:11 ;  Zephaniah 2:8-10 ).  </p><p> After the Return, it was Sanballat, a Moabite, who took chief part in seeking to prevent the rebuilding of Jerusalem ( Nehemiah 2:19 ;  4:1 ;  6:1 ).  </p>
Moabite Stone	<p>a basalt stone, bearing an inscription by King Mesha, which was discovered at Dibon by Klein, a German missionary at Jerusalem, in 1868. It was 3 1/2 feet high and 2 in breadth and in thickness, rounded at the top. It consisted of thirty-four lines, written in Hebrew-Phoenician characters. It was set up by Mesha as a record and memorial of his victories. It records (1) Mesha's wars with Omri, (2) his public buildings, and (3) his wars against Horonaim. This inscription in a remarkable degree supplements and corroborates the history of King Mesha recorded in  2 Kings 3:4-27 .  </p><p> With the exception of a very few variations, the Moabite language in which the inscription is written is identical with the Hebrew. The form of the letters here used supplies very important and interesting information regarding the history of the formation of the alphabet, as well as, incidentally, regarding the arts of civilized life of those times in the land of Moab. </p><p> This ancient monument, recording the heroic struggles of King Mesha with Omri and Ahab, was erected about B.C. 900. Here "we have the identical slab on which the workmen of the old world carved the history of their own times, and from which the eye of their contemporaries read thousands of years ago the record of events of which they themselves had been the witnesses." It is the oldest inscription written in alphabetic characters, and hence is, apart from its value in the domain of Hebrew antiquities, of great linguistic importance.  </p>
Moladah	<p>birth, a city in the south of Judah which fell to Simeon ( Joshua 15:21-26 ;  19:2 ). It has been identified with the modern el-Milh, 10 miles east of Beersheba.  </p>
Mole	<p>Heb. tinshameth ( Leviticus 11:30 ), probably signifies some species of lizard (rendered in RSV, "chameleon"). In  Leviticus 11:18 ,  Deuteronomy 14:16 , it is rendered, in Authorized Version, "swan" (RSV, "horned owl").  </p><p> The Heb. holed ( Leviticus 11:29 ), rendered "weasel," was probably the mole-rat. The true mole (Talpa Europoea) is not found in Palestine. The mole-rat (Spalax typhlus) "is twice the size of our mole, with no external eyes, and with only faint traces within of the rudimentary organ; no apparent ears, but, like the mole, with great internal organs of hearing; a strong, bare snout, and with large gnawing teeth; its colour a pale slate; its feet short, and provided with strong nails; its tail only rudimentary."  </p><p> In  Isaiah 2:20 , this word is the rendering of two words _haphar peroth_, which are rendered by Gesenius "into the digging of rats", i.e., rats' holes. But these two Hebrew words ought probably to be combined into one (lahporperoth) and translated "to the moles", i.e., the rat-moles. This animal "lives in underground communities, making large subterranean chambers for its young and for storehouses, with many runs connected with them, and is decidedly partial to the loose debris among ruins and stone-heaps, where it can form its chambers with least trouble."  </p>
Moloch	<p>king, the name of the national god of the Ammonites, to whom children were sacrificed by fire. He was the consuming and destroying and also at the same time the purifying fire. In  Amos 5:26 , "your Moloch" of the Authorized Version is "your king" in the Revised Version (Compare  Acts 7:43 ). Solomon ( 1 Kings 11:7 ) erected a high place for this idol on the Mount of Olives, and from that time till the days of Josiah his worship continued ( 2 Kings 23:10 2 Kings 23:13 ). In the days of Jehoahaz it was partially restored, but after the Captivity wholly disappeared. He is also called Molech ( Leviticus 18:21 ;  20:2-5 , etc.), Milcom ( 1 Kings 11:5 1 Kings 11:33 , etc.), and Malcham ( Zephaniah 1:5 ). This god became Chemosh among the Moabites.  </p>
Money	<p>Of uncoined money the first notice we have is in the history of Abraham ( Genesis 13:2 ;  20:16 ;  24:35 ). Next, this word is used in connection with the purchase of the cave of Machpelah ( 23:16 ), and again in connection with Jacob's purchase of a field at Shalem ( Genesis 33:18 Genesis 33:19 ) for "an hundred pieces of money"=an hundred Hebrew kesitahs (q.v.), i.e., probably pieces of money, as is supposed, bearing the figure of a lamb.  </p><p> The history of Joseph affords evidence of the constant use of money, silver of a fixed weight. This appears also in all the subsequent history of the Jewish people, in all their internal as well as foreign transactions. There were in common use in trade silver pieces of a definite weight, shekels, half-shekels, and quarter-shekels. But these were not properly coins, which are pieces of metal authoritatively issued, and bearing a stamp. </p><p> Of the use of coined money we have no early notice among the Hebrews. The first mentioned is of Persian coinage, the daric ( Ezra 2:69 ;  Nehemiah 7:70 ) and the 'adarkon ( Ezra 8:27 ). The daric (q.v.) was a gold piece current in Palestine in the time of Cyrus. As long as the Jews, after the Exile, lived under Persian rule, they used Persian coins. These gave place to Greek coins when Palestine came under the dominion of the Greeks (B.C. 331), the coins consisting of gold, silver, and copper pieces. The usual gold pieces were staters (q.v.), and the silver coins tetradrachms and drachms.  </p><p> In the year B.C. 140, Antiochus VII. gave permission to Simon the Maccabee to coin Jewish money. Shekels (q.v.) were then coined bearing the figure of the almond rod and the pot of manna.  </p>
Money-changer	<p>( Matthew 21:12 ;  Mark 11:15 ;  John 2:15 ). Every Israelite from twenty years and upwards had to pay ( Exodus 30:13-15 ) into the sacred treasury half a shekel every year as an offering to Jehovah, and that in the exact Hebrew half-shekel piece. There was a class of men, who frequented the temple courts, who exchanged at a certain premium foreign moneys for these half-shekels to the Jews who came up to Jerusalem from all parts of the world. (See PASSOVER .) When our Lord drove the traffickers out of the temple, these money-changers fared worst. Their tables were overturned and they themselves were expelled. </p>
Month	<p>Among the Egyptians the month of thirty days each was in use long before the time of the Exodus, and formed the basis of their calculations. From the time of the institution of the Mosaic law the month among the Jews was lunar. The cycle of religious feasts depended on the moon. The commencement of a month was determined by the observation of the new moon. The number of months in the year was usually twelve ( 1 Kings 4:7 ;  1 Chronicles 27:1-15 ); but every third year an additional month (ve-Adar) was inserted, so as to make the months coincide with the seasons.  </p><p> "The Hebrews and Phoenicians had no word for month save 'moon,' and only saved their calendar from becoming vague like that of the Moslems by the interpolation of an additional month. There is no evidence at all that they ever used a true solar year such as the Egyptians possessed. The latter had twelve months of thirty days and five epagomenac or odd days.", Palestine Quarterly, January 1889.  </p>
Moon	<p>heb. yareah, from its paleness ( Ezra 6:15 ), and lebanah, the "white" (Cant  6:10 ;  Isaiah 24:23 ), was appointed by the Creator to be with the sun "for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years" ( Genesis 1:14-16 ). A lunation was among the Jews the period of a month, and several of their festivals were held on the day of the new moon. It is frequently referred to along with the sun ( Joshua 10:12 ;  Psalms 72:5 Psalms 72:7 Psalms 72:17 ;  Psalms 89:36 Psalms 89:37 ; Eccl  12:2 ;  Isaiah 24:23 , etc.), and also by itself ( Psalms 8:3 ;  121:6 ).  </p><p> The great brilliance of the moon in Eastern countries led to its being early an object of idolatrous worship ( Deuteronomy 4:19 ;  17:3 ;  Job 31:26 ), a form of idolatry against which the Jews were warned ( Deuteronomy 4:19 ;  17:3 ). They, however, fell into this idolatry, and offered incense ( 2 Kings 23:5 ;  Jeremiah 8:2 ), and also cakes of honey, to the moon ( Jeremiah 7:18 ;  Jeremiah 44:17-19 Jeremiah 44:25 ).  </p>
Mordecai	<p>the son of Jair, of the tribe of Benjamin. It has been alleged that he was carried into captivity with Jeconiah, and hence that he must have been at least one hundred and twenty-nine years old in the twelfth year of Ahasuerus (Xerxes). But the words of Esther do not necessarily lead to this conclusion. It was probably Kish of whom it is said (ver. 6) that he "had been carried away with the captivity."  </p><p> He resided at Susa, the metropolis of Persia. He adopted his cousin Hadassah (Esther), an orphan child, whom he tenderly brought up as his own daughter. When she was brought into the king's harem and made queen in the room of the deposed queen Vashti, he was promoted to some office in the court of Ahasuerus, and was one of those who "sat in the king's gate" ( Esther 2:21 ). While holding this office, he discovered a plot of the eunuchs to put the king to death, which, by his vigilance, was defeated. His services to the king in this matter were duly recorded in the royal chronicles.  </p><p> Haman (q.v.) the Agagite had been raised to the highest position at court. Mordecai refused to bow down before him; and Haman, being stung to the quick by the conduct of Mordecai, resolved to accomplish his death in a wholesale destruction of the Jewish exiles throughout the Persian empire ( Esther 3:8-15 ). Tidings of this cruel scheme soon reached the ears of Mordecai, who communicated with Queen Esther regarding it, and by her wise and bold intervention the scheme was frustrated. The Jews were delivered from destruction, Mordecai was raised to a high rank, and Haman was executed on the gallows he had by anticipation erected for Mordecai ( (6:2-7:10). ). In memory of the signal deliverance thus wrought for them, the Jews to this day celebrate the feast ( 9:26-32 ) of Purim (q.v.).  </p>
Moreh	<p>an archer, teacher; fruitful. </p><li> A Canaanite probably who inhabited the district south of Shechem, between Mounts Ebal and Gerizim, and gave his name to the "plain" there ( Genesis 12:6 ). Here at this "plain," or rather (RSV) "oak," of Moreh, Abraham built his first altar in the land of Palestine; and here the Lord appeared unto him. He afterwards left this plain and moved southward, and pitched his tent between Bethel on the west and Hai on the east ( Genesis 12:7 Genesis 12:8 ).   </li>
Moreh, the Hill of	<p>probably identical with "little Hermon," the modern Jebel ed-Duhy, or perhaps one of the lower spurs of this mountain. It is a gray ridge parallel to Gilboa on the north; and between the two lay the battle-field, the plain of Jezreel (q.v.), where Gideon overthrew the Midianites ( Judges 7:1-12 ).  </p>
Moresheth-gath	<p>possession of the wine-press, the birthplace of the prophet ( Micah 1:14 ), who is called the "Morasthite" ( Jeremiah 26:18 ). This place was probably a suburb of Gath.  </p>
Moriah	<p>the chosen of Jehovah. Some contend that Mount Gerizim is meant, but most probably we are to regard this as one of the hills of Jerusalem. Here Solomon's temple was built, on the spot that had been the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite ( 2 Samuel 24:24 2 Samuel 24:25 ;  2 Chr  3:1 ). It is usually included in Zion, to the north-east of which it lay, and from which it was separated by the Tyropoean valley. This was "the land of Moriah" to which Abraham went to offer up his son Isaac ( Genesis 22:2 ). It has been supposed that the highest point of the temple hill, which is now covered by the Mohammedan Kubbetes-Sakhrah, or "Dome of the Rock," is the actual site of Araunah's threshing-floor. Here also, one thousand years after Abraham, David built an altar and offered sacrifices to God. (See JERUSALEM; NUMBERING THE  PEOPLE .) </p>
Mortar	<p>(Heb. homer), cement of lime and sand ( Genesis 11:3 ;  Exodus 1:14 ); also potter's clay ( Isaiah 41:25 ;  Nahum 3:14 ). Also Heb. 'aphar, usually rendered "dust," clay or mud used for cement in building ( Leviticus 14:42 Leviticus 14:45 ).  </p><p> Mortar for pulverizing ( Proverbs 27:22 ) grain or other substances by means of a pestle instead of a mill. Mortars were used in the wilderness for pounding the manna ( Numbers 11:8 ). It is commonly used in Palestine at the present day to pound wheat, from which the Arabs make a favourite dish called kibby.  </p>
Mosera	<p>a bond, one of the stations of the Israelites in the wilderness ( Deuteronomy 10:6 ), at the foot of Mount Hor. (Compare  Numbers 33:37 Numbers 33:38 ). It has been identified with el-Tayibeh, a small fountain at the bottom of the pass leading to the ascent of Mount Hor.  </p>
Moseroth	<p>bonds, one of the stations in the wilderness ( Numbers 33:30 Numbers 33:31 ), probably the same as Mosera.  </p>
Moses	<p>drawn (or Egypt. mesu, "son;" hence Rameses, royal son). On the invitation of Pharaoh ( Genesis 45:17-25 ), Jacob and his sons went down into Egypt. This immigration took place probably about 350 years before the birth of Moses. Some centuries before Joseph, Egypt had been conquered by a pastoral Semitic race from Asia, the Hyksos, who brought into cruel subjection the native Egyptians, who were an African race. Jacob and his retinue were accustomed to a shepherd's life, and on their arrival in Egypt were received with favour by the king, who assigned them the "best of the land", the land of Goshen, to dwell in. The Hyksos or "shepherd" king who thus showed favour to Joseph and his family was in all probability the Pharaoh Apopi (or Apopis).  </p><p> Thus favoured, the Israelites began to "multiply exceedingly" ( Genesis 47:27 ), and extended to the west and south. At length the supremacy of the Hyksos came to an end. The descendants of Jacob were allowed to retain their possession of Goshen undisturbed, but after the death of Joseph their position was not so favourable. The Egyptians began to despise them, and the period of their "affliction" ( Genesis 15:13 ) commenced. They were sorely oppressed. They continued, however, to increase in numbers, and "the land was filled with them" ( Exodus 1:7 ). The native Egyptians regarded them with suspicion, so that they felt all the hardship of a struggle for existence.  </p><p> In process of time "a king [probably Seti I.] arose who knew not Joseph" ( Exodus 1:8 ). (See PHARAOH .) The circumstances of the country were such that this king thought it necessary to weaken his Israelite subjects by oppressing them, and by degrees reducing their number. They were accordingly made public slaves, and were employed in connection with his numerous buildings, especially in the erection of store-cities, temples, and palaces. The children of Israel were made to serve with rigour. Their lives were made bitter with hard bondage, and "all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour" ( Exodus 1:13 Exodus 1:14 ). But this cruel oppression had not the result expected of reducing their number. On the contrary, "the more the Egyptians afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew" ( Exodus 1:12 ).  </p><p> The king next tried, through a compact secretly made with the guild of midwives, to bring about the destruction of all the Hebrew male children that might be born. But the king's wish was not rigorously enforced; the male children were spared by the midwives, so that "the people multiplied" more than ever. Thus baffled, the king issued a public proclamation calling on the people to put to death all the Hebrew male children by casting them into the river ( Exodus 1:22 ). But neither by this edict was the king's purpose effected.  </p><p> One of the Hebrew households into which this cruel edict of the king brought great alarm was that of Amram, of the family of the Kohathites ( Exodus 6:16-20 ), who with his wife Jochebed and two children, Miriam, a girl of perhaps fifteen years of age, and Aaron, a boy of three years, resided in or near Memphis, the capital city of that time. In this quiet home a male child was born (B.C. 1571). His mother concealed him in the house for three months from the knowledge of the civic authorities. But when the task of concealment became difficult, Jochebed contrived to bring her child under the notice of the daughter of the king by constructing for him an ark of bulrushes, which she laid among the flags which grew on the edge of the river at the spot where the princess was wont to come down and bathe. Her plan was successful. The king's daughter "saw the child; and behold the child wept." The princess (see PHARAOH'S'S DAUGHTER [1]) sent Miriam, who was standing by, to fetch a nurse. She went and brought the mother of the child, to whom the princess said, "Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages." Thus Jochebed's child, whom the princess called "Moses", i.e., "Saved from the water" ( Exodus 2:10 ), was ultimately restored to her.  </p><p> As soon as the natural time for weaning the child had come, he was transferred from the humble abode of his father to the royal palace, where he was brought up as the adopted son of the princess, his mother probably accompanying him and caring still for him. He grew up amid all the grandeur and excitement of the Egyptian court, maintaining, however, probably a constant fellowship with his mother, which was of the highest importance as to his religious belief and his interest in his "brethren." His education would doubtless be carefully attended to, and he would enjoy all the advantages of training both as to his body and his mind. He at length became "learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians" ( Acts 7:22 ). Egypt had then two chief seats of learning, or universities, at one of which, probably that of Heliopolis, his education was completed. Moses, being now about twenty years of age, spent over twenty more before he came into prominence in Bible history. These twenty years were probably spent in military service. There is a tradition recorded by Josephus that he took a lead in the war which was then waged between Egypt and Ethiopia, in which he gained renown as a skilful general, and became "mighty in deeds" ( Acts 7:22 ).  </p><p> After the termination of the war in Ethiopia, Moses returned to the Egyptian court, where he might reasonably have expected to be loaded with honours and enriched with wealth. But "beneath the smooth current of his life hitherto, a life of alternate luxury at the court and comparative hardness in the camp and in the discharge of his military duties, there had lurked from childhood to youth, and from youth to manhood, a secret discontent, perhaps a secret ambition. Moses, amid all his Egyptian surroundings, had never forgotten, had never wished to forget, that he was a Hebrew." He now resolved to make himself acquainted with the condition of his countrymen, and "went out unto his brethren, and looked upon their burdens" ( Exodus 2:11 ). This tour of inspection revealed to him the cruel oppression and bondage under which they everywhere groaned, and could not fail to press on him the serious consideration of his duty regarding them. The time had arrived for his making common cause with them, that he might thereby help to break their yoke of bondage. He made his choice accordingly ( Hebrews 11:25-27 ), assured that God would bless his resolution for the welfare of his people. He now left the palace of the king and took up his abode, probably in his father's house, as one of the Hebrew people who had for forty years been suffering cruel wrong at the hands of the Egyptians.  </p><p> He could not remain indifferent to the state of things around him, and going out one day among the people, his indignation was roused against an Egyptian who was maltreating a Hebrew. He rashly lifted up his hand and slew the Egyptian, and hid his body in the sand. Next day he went out again and found two Hebrews striving together. He speedily found that the deed of the previous day was known. It reached the ears of Pharaoh (the "great Rameses," Rameses II.), who "sought to slay Moses" ( Exodus 2:15 ). Moved by fear, Moses fled from Egypt, and betook himself to the land of Midian, the southern part of the peninsula of Sinai, probably by much the same route as that by which, forty years afterwards, he led the Israelites to Sinai. He was providentially led to find a new home with the family of Reuel, where he remained for forty years ( Acts 7:30 ), under training unconsciously for his great life's work.  </p><p> Suddenly the angel of the Lord appeared to him in the burning bush ( Exodus 3 ), and commissioned him to go down to Egypt and "bring forth the children of Israel" out of bondage. He was at first unwilling to go, but at length he was obedient to the heavenly vision, and left the land of Midian ( 4:18-26 ). On the way he was met by Aaron (q.v.) and the elders of Israel (27-31). He and Aaron had a hard task before them; but the Lord was with them (ch. 7-12), and the ransomed host went forth in triumph. (See EXODUS .) After an eventful journey to and fro in the wilderness, we see them at length encamped in the plains of Moab, ready to cross over the Jordan into the Promised Land. There Moses addressed the assembled elders ( Deuteronomy 1:1-4 ;  5:1-26:19; ;  27:11-30:20), ), and gives the people his last counsels, and then rehearses the great song ( Deuteronomy 32 ), clothing in fitting words the deep emotions of his heart at such a time, and in review of such a marvellous history as that in which he had acted so conspicious a part. Then, after blessing the tribes (33), he ascends to "the mountain of Nebo (q.v.), to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho" ( 34:1 ), and from thence he surveys the land. "Jehovah shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea, and the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar" ( Deuteronomy 34:2-3 ), the magnificient inheritance of the tribes of whom he had been so long the leader; and there he died, being one hundred and twenty years old, according to the word of the Lord, and was buried by the Lord "in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor" ( 34:6 ). The people mourned for him during thirty days.  </p><p> Thus died "Moses the man of God" ( Deuteronomy 33:1 ;  Joshua 14:6 ). He was distinguished for his meekness and patience and firmness, and "he endured as seeing him who is invisible." "There arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face, in all the signs and the wonders, which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, and in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel" ( Deuteronomy 34:10-12 ).  </p><p> The name of Moses occurs frequently in the Psalms and Prophets as the chief of the prophets. </p><p> In the New Testament he is referred to as the representative of the law and as a type of Christ ( John 1:17 ;  2 co  3:13-18 ;  Hebrews 3:5 Hebrews 3:6 ). Moses is the only character in the Old Testament to whom Christ likens himself ( John 5:46 ; Compare  Deuteronomy 18:15 Deuteronomy 18:18 Deuteronomy 18:19 ;  Acts 7:37 ). In  Hebrews 3:1-19  this likeness to Moses is set forth in various particulars.  </p><p> In  Jude 1:9  mention is made of a contention between Michael and the devil about the body of Moses. This dispute is supposed to have had reference to the concealment of the body of Moses so as to prevent idolatry.  </p>
Mote	<p>(Gr. karphos, something dry, hence a particle of wood or chaff, etc.). A slight moral defect is likened to a mote ( Matthew 7:3-5 ;  Luke 6:41 Luke 6:42 ).  </p>
Moth	<p>Heb. 'ash, from a root meaning "to fall away," as moth-eaten garments fall to pieces ( Job 4:19 ;  13:28 ;  Isaiah 50:9 ;  51:8 ;  Hosea 5:12 ).  </p><p> Gr. ses, thus rendered in  Matthew 6:19 Matthew 6:20 ;  Luke 12:33 . Allusion is thus made to the destruction of clothing by the larvae of the clothes-moth. This is the only lepidopterous insect referred to in Scripture.  </p>
Mouldy	<p>Of the Gibeonites it is said that "all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy" ( Joshua 9:5 Joshua 9:12 ). The Hebrew word here rendered "mouldy" (nikuddim) is rendered "cracknels" in  1 Kings 14:3 , and denotes a kind of crisp cake. The meaning is that the bread of the Gibeonites had become dry and hard, hard as biscuits, and thus was an evidence of the length of the journey they had travelled.  </p>
Mount	<p>Palestine is a hilly country ( Deuteronomy 3:25 ;  11:11 ;  Ezekiel 34:13 ). West of Jordan the mountains stretch from Lebanon far down into Galilee, terminating in Carmel. The isolated peak of Tabor rises from the elevated plain of Esdraelon, which, in the south, is shut in by hills spreading over the greater part of Samaria. The mountains of Western and Middle Palestine do not extend to the sea, but gently slope into plains, and toward the Jordan fall down into the Ghor.  </p><p> East of the Jordan the Anti-Lebanon, stretching south, terminates in the hilly district called Jebel Heish, which reaches down to the Sea of Gennesareth. South of the river Hieromax there is again a succession of hills, which are traversed by wadies running toward the Jordan. These gradually descend to a level at the river Arnon, which was the boundary of the ancient trans-Jordanic territory toward the south. </p><p> The composition of the Palestinian hills is limestone, with occasional strata of chalk, and hence the numerous caves, some of large extent, found there. </p>
Mount of beatitudes	<p>See SERMON . </p>
Mount of corruption	<p>( 2 Kings 23:13 ; Vulg., "mount of offence"), the name given to a part of the Mount of Olives, so called because idol temples were there erected in the time of Solomon, temples to the Zidonian Ashtoreth and to the "abominations" of Moab and Ammon.  </p>
Mount of the Amalekites	<p>a place near Pirathon (q.v.), in the tribe of Ephraim (Judg.  12:15 ).  </p>
Mount of the Amorites	<p>the range of hills which rises abruptly in the wilderness of et-Tih ("the wandering"), mentioned  Deuteronomy 1:19 Deuteronomy 1:20 , "that great and terrible wilderness."  </p>
Mount of the congregation	<p>only in  Isaiah 14:13 , a mythic mountain of the Babylonians, regarded by them as the seat of the gods. It was situated in the far north, and in Babylonian inscriptions is described as a mountain called Im-Kharasak, "the mighty mountain of Bel, whose head reaches heaven, whose root is the holy deep." In their geography they are said to have identified it with mount El-wend, near Ecbatana.  </p>
Mount of the valley	<p>( Joshua 13:19 ), a district in the east of Jordan, in the territory of Reuben. The "valley" here was probably the Ghor or valley of the Jordan, and hence the "mount" would be the hilly region in the north end of the Dead Sea. (See ZARETH-SHAHAR.)  </p>
Mourn	<p>Frequent references are found in Scripture to, </p><li> Mourning for the dead. Abraham mourned for Sarah ( Genesis 23:2 ); Jacob for Joseph ( Genesis 37:34 Genesis 37:35 ); the Egyptians for Jacob ( 50:3-10 ); Israel for Aaron ( Numbers 20:29 ), for Moses ( Deuteronomy 34:8 ), and for Samuel ( 1 Samuel 25:1 ); David for Abner ( 2 Samuel 3:31 2 Samuel 3:35 ); Mary and Martha for Lazarus ( John 11 ); devout men for Stephen ( Acts 8:2 ), etc.  </li><li> For calamities, ( Job 1:20 Job 1:21 ;  2:8 ); Israel ( Exodus 33:4 ); the Ninevites ( Jonah 3:5 ); Israel, when defeated by Benjamin ( Judges 20:26 ), etc.  </li><li> Penitential mourning, by the Israelites on the day of atonement ( Leviticus 23:27 ;  Acts 27:9 ); under Samuel's ministry ( 1 Samuel 7:6 ); predicted in Zechariah ( Zechariah 12:10 Zechariah 12:11 ); in many of the psalms (51, etc.).  <p> Mourning was expressed, (1) by weeping ( Genesis 35:8 , marg.;  Luke 7:38 , etc.); (2) by loud lamentation ( Ruth 1:9 ;  1 Samuel 6:19 ;  2 Sam  3:31 ); (3) by the disfigurement of the person, as rending the clothes ( Genesis 37:29 Genesis 37:34 ;  Matthew 26:65 ), wearing sackcloth ( Genesis 37:34 ;  Psalms 35:13 ), sprinkling dust or ashes on the person ( 2 Samuel 13:19 ;  Jeremiah 6:26 ;  Job 2:12 ), shaving the head and plucking out the hair of the head or beard ( Leviticus 10:6 ;  Job 1:20 ), neglect of the person or the removal of ornaments ( Exodus 33:4 ;  Deuteronomy 21:12 Deuteronomy 21:13 ;  2 Sam  14:2 ;  19:24 ;  Matthew 6:16 Matthew 6:17 ), fasting ( 2 Samuel 1:12 ), covering the upper lip ( Leviticus 13:45 ;  Micah 3:7 ), cutting the flesh ( Jeremiah 16:6 Jeremiah 16:7 ), and sitting in silence ( Judges 20:26 ;  2 Sam  12:16 ;  13:31 ;  Job 1:20 ).  </p><p> In the later times we find a class of mourners who could be hired to give by their loud lamentation the external tokens of sorrow ( 2 Chronicles 35:25 ;  Jeremiah 9:17 ;  Matthew 9:23 ).  </p><p> The period of mourning for the dead varied. For Jacob it was seventy days ( Genesis 50:3 ); for Aaron ( Numbers 20:29 ) and Moses ( Deuteronomy 34:8 ) thirty days; and for Saul only seven days ( 1 Samuel 31:13 ). In  2 Samuel 3:31-35 , we have a description of the great mourning for the death of Abner.  </p> </li>
Mouse	<p>Heb. 'akhbar, "swift digger"), properly the dormouse, the field-mouse ( 1 Samuel 6:4 ). In  Leviticus 11:29 ,  Isaiah 66:17  this word is used generically, and includes the jerboa (Mus jaculus), rat, hamster (Cricetus), which, though declared to be unclean animals, were eaten by the Arabs, and are still eaten by the Bedouins. It is said that no fewer than twenty-three species of this group ('akhbar=Arab. ferah) of animals inhabit Palestine. God "laid waste" the people of Ashdod by the terrible visitation of field-mice, which are like locusts in their destructive effects ( 1 Samuel 6:4 1 Samuel 6:11 1 Samuel 6:18 ). Herodotus, the Greek historian, accounts for the destruction of the army of Sennacherib ( 2 Kings 19:35 ) by saying that in the night thousands of mice invaded the camp and gnawed through the bow-strings, quivers, and shields, and thus left the Assyrians helpless. (See SENNACHERIB .) </p>
Mowing	<p>(Heb. gez), rendered in  Psalms 72:6  "mown grass." The expression "king's mowings" ( Amos 7:1 ) refers to some royal right of early pasturage, the first crop of grass for the cavalry (Compare  1 Kings 18:5 ).  </p>
Moza	<p>a going forth. </p><li> One of the sons of Caleb ( 1 Chronicles 2:46 ).  </li><li> The son of Zimri, of the posterity of Saul ( 1 Chronicles 8:36 1 Chronicles 8:37 ;  1 Chronicles 9:42 1 Chronicles 9:43 ).   </li>
Mozah	<p>an issuing of water, a city of Benjamin ( Joshua 18:26 ).  </p>
Mufflers	<p>( Isaiah 3:19 ), veils, light and tremulous. Margin, "spangled ornaments."  </p>
Mulberry	<p>Heb. bakah, "to weep;" rendered "Baca" (RSV, "weeping") in  Psalms 84:6 . The plural form of the Hebrew bekaim is rendered "mulberry trees" in 2Sam 5:23,24and  1 Chronicles 14:14 1 Chronicles 14:15 . The tree here alluded to was probably the aspen or trembling poplar. "We know with certainty that the black poplar, the aspen, and the Lombardy poplar grew in Palestine. The aspen, whose long leaf-stalks cause the leaves to tremble with every breath of wind, unites with the willow and the oak to overshadow the watercourses of the Lebanon, and with the oleander and the acacia to adorn the ravines of Southern Palestine" (Kitto). By "the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees" we are to understand a rustling among the trees like the marching of an army. This was the signal that the Lord himself would lead forth David's army to victory. (See SYCAMINE .) </p>
Mule	<p>(Heb. pered), so called from the quick step of the animal or its power of carrying loads. It is not probable that the Hebrews bred mules, as this was strictly forbidden in the law ( Leviticus 19:19 ), although their use was not forbidden. We find them in common use even by kings and nobles ( 2 Samuel 18:9 ;  1 Kings 1:33 ;  2 Kings  5:17 ;  Psalms 32:9 ). They are not mentioned, however, till the time of David, for the word rendered "mules" (RSV correctly, "hot springs") in  Genesis 36:24  (yemim) properly denotes the warm springs of Callirhoe, on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea. In David's reign they became very common ( 2 Samuel 13:29 ;  1 Kings 10:25 ).  </p><p> Mules are not mentioned in the New Testament. Perhaps they had by that time ceased to be used in Palestine. </p>
Murder	<p>Wilful murder was distinguished from accidental homicide, and was invariably visited with capital punishment ( Numbers 35:16 Numbers 35:18 Numbers 35:21 Numbers 35:31 ;  Leviticus 24:17 ). This law in its principle is founded on the fact of man's having been made in the likeness of God ( Genesis 9:5 Genesis 9:6 ;  John 8:44 ;  1 John 3:12 1 John 3:15 ). The Mosiac law prohibited any compensation for murder or the reprieve of the murderer ( Exodus 21:12 Exodus 21:14 ;  Deuteronomy 19:11 Deuteronomy 19:13 ;  2 Sam  <span class="badLink">17:25</span> ;  20:10 ). Two witnesses were required in any capital case ( Numbers 35:19-30 ;  Deuteronomy 17:6-12 ). If the murderer could not be discovered, the city nearest the scene of the murder was required to make expiation for the crime committed ( Deuteronomy 21:1-9 ). These offences also were to be punished with death, (1) striking a parent; (2) cursing a parent; (3) kidnapping ( Exodus 21:15-17 ;  Deuteronomy 27:16 ).  </p>
Murmuring	<p>of the Hebrews in the wilderness, called forth the displeasure of God, which was only averted by the earnest prayer of Moses ( Numbers 11:33 Numbers 11:34 ;  12 ;  Numbers 14:27 Numbers 14:30 Numbers 14:31 ;  16:3 ;  21:4-6 ;  Psalms 106:25 ). Forbidden by Paul ( 1 Corinthians 10:10 ).  </p>
Murrain	<p>Heb. deber, "destruction," a "great mortality", the fifth plague that fell upon the Egyptians ( Exodus 9:3 ). It was some distemper that resulted in the sudden and widespread death of the cattle. It was confined to the cattle of the Egyptians that were in the field ( 9:6 ).  </p>
Mushi	<p>receding, the second of the two sons of Merari ( Exodus 6:19 ;  Numbers 3:20 ). His sons were called Mushites ( Numbers 3:33 ;  26:58 ).  </p>
Music	<p>Jubal was the inventor of musical instruments ( Genesis 4:21 ). The Hebrews were much given to the cultivation of music. Their whole history and literature afford abundant evidence of this. After the Deluge, the first mention of music is in the account of Laban's interview with Jacob ( Genesis 31:27 ). After their triumphal passage of the Red Sea, Moses and the children of Israel sang their song of deliverance ( Exodus 15 ).  </p><p> But the period of Samuel, David, and Solomon was the golden age of Hebrew music, as it was of Hebrew poetry. Music was now for the first time systematically cultivated. It was an essential part of training in the schools of the prophets ( 1 Samuel 10:5 ;  19:19-24 ;  2 Kings  3:15 ;  1 Chronicles 25:6 ). There now arose also a class of professional singers ( 2 Samuel 19:35 ; Eccl  2:8 ). The temple, however, was the great school of music. In the conducting of its services large bands of trained singers and players on instruments were constantly employed ( 2 Samuel 6:5 ;  1 Chronicles 15 ;  16 ;  <span class="badLink">235</span> ;5;  25:1-6 ).  </p><p> In private life also music seems to have held an important place among the Hebrews (Eccl  2:8 ;  Amos 6:4-6 ;  Isaiah 5:11 Isaiah 5:12 ;  Isaiah 24:8 Isaiah 24:9 ;  Psalms 137 ;  Jeremiah 48:33 ;  Luke 15:25 ).  </p>
Music, Instrumental	<p>Among instruments of music used by the Hebrews a principal place is given to stringed instruments. These were, </p><li> The kinnor, the "harp." </li><li> The nebel, "a skin bottle," rendered "psaltery." </li><li> The sabbeka, or "sackbut," a lute or lyre. </li><li> The gittith, occurring in the title of  Psalms 8 ;  8 ;  84 . </li><li> Minnim ( Psalms 150:4 ), rendered "stringed instruments;" in  Psalms 45:8 , in the form <i> minni</i> , probably the apocopated (i.e., shortened) plural, rendered, Authorized Version, "whereby," and in the Revised Version "stringed instruments." </li><li> Machalath, in the titles of  Psalms 53  and 88; supposed to be a kind of lute or guitar.  <p> Of wind instruments mention is made of, </p></li><li> The 'ugab ( Genesis 4:21 ;  Job 21:12 ;  30:31 ), probably the so-called Pan's pipes or syrinx. </li><li> The qeren or "horn" ( Joshua 6:5 ;  1 Chronicles 25:5 ). </li><li> The shophar, rendered "trumpet" ( Joshua 6:4 Joshua 6:6 Joshua 6:8 ). The word means "bright," and may have been so called from the clear, shrill sound it emitted. It was often used ( Exodus 19:13 ;  Numbers 10:10 ;  Judges 7:16 Judges 7:18 ;  1 Samuel 13:3 ). </li><li> The hatsotserah, or straight trumpet ( Psalms 98:6 ;  Numbers 10:1-10 ). This name is supposed by some to be an onomatopoetic word, intended to imitate the pulse-like sound of the trumpet, like the Latin taratantara. Some have identified it with the modern trombone. </li><li> The halil, i.e, "bored through," a flute or pipe ( 1 Samuel 10:5 ;  1 Kings 1:40 ;  Isaiah 5:12 ;  Jeremiah 48:36 ) which is still used in Palestine. </li><li> The sumponyah, rendered "dulcimer" ( Daniel 3:5 ), probably a sort of bagpipe. </li><li> The maskrokith'a ( Daniel 3:5 ), rendered "flute," but its precise nature is unknown.  <p> Of instruments of percussion mention is made of, </p></li><li> The toph, an instrument of the drum kind, rendered "timbrel" ( Exodus 15:20 ;  Job 21:12 ;  Psalms 68:25 ); also "tabret" ( Genesis 31:27 ;  Isaiah 24:8 ;  1 Samuel 10:5 ). </li><li> The paamon, the "bells" on the robe of the high priest ( Exodus 28:33 ;  39:25 ). </li><li> The tseltselim, "cymbals" ( 2 Samuel 6:5 ;  Psalms 150:5 ), which are struck together and produce a loud, clanging sound. Metsilloth, "bells" on horses and camels for ornament, and metsiltayim, "cymbals" ( 1 Chronicles 13:8 ;  Ezra 3:10 , etc.). These words are all derived from the same root, tsalal, meaning "to tinkle." </li><li> The menaan'im, used only in  2 Samuel 6:5 , rendered "cornets" (RSV, "castanets"); in the Vulgate, "sistra," an instrument of agitation. </li><li> The shalishim, mentioned only in  1 Samuel 18:6 , rendered "instruments of music" (marg. of RSV, "triangles or three-stringed instruments").  <p> The words in Eccl  2:8 , "musical instruments, and that of all sorts," Authorized Version, are in the Revised Version "concubines very many."  </p> </li>
Musician, Chief	<p>(Heb. menatstseah), the precentor of the Levitical choir or orchestra in the temple, mentioned in the titles of fifty-five psalms, and in  Habakkuk 3:19 , Revised Version. The first who held this office was Jeduthun ( 1 Chronicles 16:41 ), and the office appears to have been hereditary. Heman and Asaph were his two colleagues ( 2 Chronicles 35:15 ).  </p>
Mustard	<p>a plant of the genus sinapis, a pod-bearing, shrub-like plant, growing wild, and also cultivated in gardens. The little round seeds were an emblem of any small insignificant object. It is not mentioned in the Old Testament; and in each of the three instances of its occurrence in the New Testament ( Matthew 13:31 Matthew 13:32 ;  Mark 4:31 Mark 4:32 ;  Luke 13:18 Luke 13:19 ) it is spoken of only with reference to the smallness of its seed. The common mustard of Palestine is the Sinapis nigra. This garden herb sometimes grows to a considerable height, so as to be spoken of as "a tree" as compared with garden herbs.  </p>
Muth-labben	<p>occurring only in the title of  Psalms 9 . Some interpret the words as meaning "on the death of Labben," some unknown person. Others render the word, "on the death of the son;" i.e., of Absalom ( 2 Samuel 18:33 ). Others again have taken the word as the name of a musical instrument, or as the name of an air to which the psalm was sung.  </p>
Muzzle	<p>Grain in the East is usually thrashed by the sheaves being spread out on a floor, over which oxen and cattle are driven to and fro, till the grain is trodden out. Moses ordained that the ox was not to be muzzled while thrashing. It was to be allowed to eat both the grain and the straw ( Deuteronomy 25:4 ). (See AGRICULTURE .) </p>
Myra	<p>one of the chief towns of Lycia, in Asia Minor, about 2 1/2 miles from the coast ( Acts 27:5 ). Here Paul removed from the Adramyttian ship in which he had sailed from Caesarea, and entered into the Alexandrian ship, which was afterwards wrecked at Melita ( 27:39-44 ).  </p>
Myrrh	<p>Heb. mor. </p><li> First mentioned as a principal ingredient in the holy anointing oil ( Exodus 30:23 ). It formed part of the gifts brought by the wise men from the east, who came to worship the infant Jesus ( Matthew 2:11 ). It was used in embalming ( John 19:39 ), also as a perfume ( Esther 2:12 ;  Psalms 45:8 ;  Proverbs 7:17 ). It was a custom of the Jews to give those who were condemned to death by crucifixion "wine mingled with myrrh" to produce insensibility. This drugged wine was probably partaken of by the two malefactors, but when the Roman soldiers pressed it upon Jesus "he received it not" ( Mark 15:23 ). (See GALL .) <p> This was the gum or viscid white liquid which flows from a tree resembling the acacia, found in Africa and Arabia, the Balsamodendron myrrha of botanists. The "bundle of myrrh" in Cant  1:13  is rather a "bag" of myrrh or a scent-bag.  </p></li><li> Another word <i> lot</i> is also translated "myrrh" ( Genesis 37:25 ;  43:11 ; RSV, marg., "or ladanum"). What was meant by this word is uncertain. It has been thought to be the chestnut, mastich, stacte, balsam, turpentine, pistachio nut, or the lotus. It is probably correctly rendered by the Latin word ladanum, the Arabic ladan, an aromatic juice of a shrub called the Cistus or rock rose, which has the same qualities, though in a slight degree, of opium, whence a decoction of opium is called laudanum. This plant was indigenous to Syria and Arabia.   </li>
Myrtle	<p>( Isaiah 41:19 ;  Nehemiah 8:15 ;  Zechariah 1:8 ), Hebrew hadas, known in the East by the name <i> as</i> , the Myrtus communis of the botanist. "Although no myrtles are now found on the mount (of Olives), excepting in the gardens, yet they still exist in many of the glens about Jerusalem, where we have often seen its dark shining leaves and white flowers. There are many near Bethlehem and about Hebron, especially near Dewir Dan, the ancient Debir. It also sheds its fragrance on the sides of Carmel and of Tabor, and fringes the clefts of the Leontes in its course through Galilee. We meet with it all through Central Palestine" (Tristram). </p>
Mysia	<p>a province in the north-west of Asia Minor. On his first voyage to Europe ( Acts 16:7 Acts 16:8 ) Paul passed through this province and embarked at its chief port Troas.  </p>
Mystery	<p>the calling of the Gentiles into the Christian Church, so designated ( Ephesians 1:9 Ephesians 1:10 ;  3:8-11 ;  Colossians 1:25-27 ); a truth undiscoverable except by revelation, long hid, now made manifest. The resurrection of the dead ( 1 Corinthians 15:51 ), and other doctrines which need to be explained but which cannot be fully understood by finite intelligence ( Matthew 13:11 ;  Romans 11:25 ;  1 Corinthians 13:2 ); the union between Christ and his people symbolized by the marriage union ( Ephesians 5:31 Ephesians 5:32 ; comp  6:19 ); the seven stars and the seven candlesticks ( Revelation 1:20 ); and the woman clothed in scarlet ( 17:7 ), are also in this sense mysteries. The anti-Christian power working in his day is called by the apostle ( 2 Thessalonians 2:7 ) the "mystery of iniquity."  </p>
Nehemiah, Book of	<p>The author of this book was no doubt Nehemiah himself. There are portions of the book written in the first person (ch. 1-7;  12:27-47 , and 13). But there are also portions of it in which Nehemiah is spoken of in the third person (ch. 8; 9; 10). It is supposed that these portions may have been written by Ezra; of this, however, there is no distinct evidence. These portions had their place assigned them in the book, there can be no doubt, by Nehemiah. He was the responsible author of the whole book, with the exception of ch  Nehemiah 12:11 Nehemiah 12:22 Nehemiah 12:23 .  </p><p> The date at which the book was written was probably about B.C. 431-430, when Nehemiah had returned the second time to Jerusalem after his visit to Persia.  </p><p> The book, which may historically be regarded as a continuation of the book of Ezra, consists of four parts. </p><li> An account of the rebuilding of the wall of Jerusalem, and of the register Nehemiah had found of those who had returned from Babylon (ch. 1-7). </li><li> An account of the state of religion among the Jews during this time (8-10). </li><li> Increase of the inhabitants of Jerusalem; the census of the adult male population, and names of the chiefs, together with lists of priests and Levites ( (11-12:1-26). ). </li><li> Dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, the arrangement of the temple officers, and the reforms carried out by Nehemiah  Nehemiah 13 ).  <p> This book closes the history of the Old Testament. Malachi the prophet was contemporary with Nehemiah. </p> </li>
Nehiloth	<p>only in the title of  Psalms 5 . It is probably derived from a root meaning "to bore," "perforate," and hence denotes perforated wind instruments of all kinds. The psalm may be thus regarded as addressed to the conductor of the temple choir which played on flutes and such-like instruments.  </p>
Nehushta	<p>copper, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem, and the wife of Jehoiakin ( 2 Kings 24:8 ), king of Judah.  </p>
Nehushtan	<p>of copper; a brazen thing a name of contempt given to the serpent Moses had made in the wilderness ( Numbers 21:8 ), and which Hezekiah destroyed because the children of Israel began to regard it as an idol and "burn incense to it." The lapse of nearly one thousand years had invested the "brazen serpent" with a mysterious sanctity; and in order to deliver the people from their infatuation, and impress them with the idea of its worthlessness, Hezekiah called it, in contempt, "Nehushtan," a brazen thing, a mere piece of brass ( 2 Kings 18:4 ).  </p>
Neiel	<p>dwelling-place of God, a town in the territory of Asher, near its southern border ( Joshua 19:27 ). It has been identified with the ruin Y'anin, near the outlet of the Wady esh Sha-ghur, less than 2 miles north of Kabul, and 16 miles east of Caesarea.  </p>
Nekeb	<p>cavern, a town on the boundary of Naphtali ( Joshua 19:33 ). It has with probability, been identified with Seiyadeh, nearly 2 miles east of Bessum, a ruin half way between Tiberias and Mount Tabor.  </p>
Nemuel	<p>day of God. </p><li> One of Simeon's five sons ( 1 Chronicles 4:24 ), called also Jemuel ( Genesis 46:10 ). </li><li> A Reubenite, a son of Eliab, and brother of Dathan and Abiram ( Numbers 26:9 ).   </li>
Nephilim	<p>( Genesis 6:4 ;  Numbers 13:33 , RSV), giants, the Hebrew word left untranslated by the Revisers, the name of one of the Canaanitish tribes. The Revisers have, however, translated the Hebrew gibborim, in  Genesis 6:4 , "mighty men."  </p>
Nephtoah	<p>opened, a fountain and a stream issuing from it on the border between Judah and Benjamin ( Joshua 15:8 Joshua 15:9 ;  18:15 ). It has been identified with 'Ain Lifta, a spring about 2 1/2 miles north-west of Jerusalem. Others, however, have identified it with 'Ain' Atan, on the south-west of Bethlehem, whence water is conveyed through "Pilate's aqueduct" to the Haram area at Jerusalem.  </p>
Ner	<p>light, the father of Kish ( 1 Chronicles 8:33 ).  1 Samuel 14:51  should be read, "Kish, the father of Saul, and Ner, the father of Abner, were the sons of Abiel." And hence this Kish and Ner were brothers, and Saul and Abner were first cousins (Compare  1 Chronicles 9:36 ).  </p>
Nereus	<p>a Christian at Rome to whom Paul sent his salutation ( Romans 16:15 ).  </p>
Nergal	<p>the great dog; that is, lion, one of the chief gods of the Assyrians and Babylonians ( 2 Kings 17:30 ), the god of war and hunting. He is connected with Cutha as its tutelary deity.  </p>
Nergal-sharezer	<p>Nergal, protect the king! </p><li> One of the "princes of the king of Babylon who accompanied him in his last expedition against Jerusalem" ( Jeremiah 39:3 Jeremiah 39:13 ).  </li><li> Another of the "princes," who bore the title of "Rabmag." He was one of those who were sent to release Jeremiah from prison ( Jeremiah 39:13 ) by "the captain of the guard." He was a Babylonian grandee of high rank. From profane history and the inscriptions, we are led to conclude that he was the Neriglissar who murdered Evil-merodach, the son of Nebuchadnezzar, and succeeded him on the throne of Babylon (B.C. 559-556). He was married to a daughter of Nebuchadnezzar. The ruins of a palace, the only one on the right bank of the Euphrates, bear inscriptions denoting that it was built by this king. He was succeeded by his son, a mere boy, who was murdered after a reign of some nine months by a conspiracy of the nobles, one of whom, Nabonadius, ascended the vacant throne, and reigned for a period of seventeen years (B.C. 555-538), at the close of which period Babylon was taken by Cyrus. Belshazzar, who comes into notice in connection with the taking of Babylon, was by some supposed to have been the same as Nabonadius, who was called Nebuchadnezzar's son ( Daniel 5:11 Daniel 5:18 Daniel 5:22 ), because he had married his daughter. But it is known from the inscriptions that Nabonadius had a son called Belshazzar, who may have been his father's associate on the throne at the time of the fall of Babylon, and who therefore would be the grandson of Nebuchadnezzar. The Jews had only one word, usually rendered "father," to represent also such a relationship as that of "grandfather" or "great-grandfather."   </li>
Nero	<p>occurs only in the superscription (which is probably spurious, and is altogether omitted in the RSV) to the Second Epistle to Timothy. He became emperor of Rome when he was about seventeen years of age (A.D. 54), and soon began to exhibit the character of a cruel tyrant and heathen debauchee. In May A.D. 64, a terrible conflagration broke out in Rome, which raged for six days and seven nights, and totally destroyed a great part of the city. The guilt of this fire was attached to him at the time, and the general verdict of history accuses him of the crime. "Hence, to suppress the rumour," says Tacitus (Annals, xv. 44), "he falsely charged with the guilt, and punished with the most exquisite tortures, the persons commonly called Christians, who are hated for their enormities. Christus, the founder of that name, was put to death as a criminal by Pontius Pilate, procurator of Judea, in the reign of Tiberius; but the pernicious superstition, repressed for a time, broke out again, not only throughout Judea, where the mischief originated, but through the city of Rome also, whither all things horrible and disgraceful flow, from all quarters, as to a common receptacle, and where they are encouraged. Accordingly, first three were seized, who confessed they were Christians. Next, on their information, a vast multitude were convicted, not so much on the charge of burning the city as of hating the human race. And in their deaths they were also made the subjects of sport; for they were covered with the hides of wild beasts and worried to death by dogs, or nailed to crosses, or set fire to, and, when day declined, burned to serve for nocturnal lights. Nero offered his own gardens for that spectacle, and exhibited a Circensian game, indiscriminately mingling with the common people in the habit of a charioteer, or else standing in his chariot; whence a feeling of compassion arose toward the sufferers, though guilty and deserving to be made examples of by capital punishment, because they seemed not to be cut off for the public good, but victims to the ferocity of one man." Another Roman historian, Suetonius (Nero, xvi.), says of him: "He likewise inflicted punishments on the Christians, a sort of people who hold a new and impious superstition" (Forbes's Footsteps of St. Paul, p. 60).  </p><p> Nero was the emperor before whom Paul was brought on his first imprisonment at Rome, and the apostle is supposed to have suffered martyrdom during this persecution. He is repeatedly alluded to in Scripture ( Acts 25:11 ; Phil  Acts 1:12 Acts 1:13 ;  4:22 ). He died A.D. 68.  </p>
Net	<p>in use among the Hebrews for fishing, hunting, and fowling. The fishing-net was probably constructed after the form of that used by the Egyptians ( Isaiah 19:8 ). There were three kinds of nets. </p><li> The drag-net or hauling-net (Gr. sagene), of great size, and requiring many men to work it. It was usually let down from the fishing-boat, and then drawn to the shore or into the boat, as circumstances might require ( Matthew 13:47 Matthew 13:48 ). </li><li> The hand-net or casting-net (Gr. amphiblestron), which was thrown from a rock or a boat at any fish that might be seen ( Matthew 4:18 ;  Mark 1:16 ). It was called by the Latins funda. It was of circular form, "like the top of a tent." </li><li> The bag-net (Gr. diktyon), used for enclosing fish in deep water ( Luke 5:4-9 ).  <p> The fowling-nets were (1) the trap, consisting of a net spread over a frame, and supported by a stick in such a way that it fell with the slightest touch ( Amos 3:5 , "gin;"  Psalms 69:22 ;  Job 18:9 ; Eccl  9:12 ). (2) The snare, consisting of a cord to catch birds by the leg ( Job 18:10 ;  Psalms 18:5 ;  116:3 ;  140:5 ). </p></li><li> The decoy, a cage filled with birds as decoys ( Jeremiah 5:26 Jeremiah 5:27 ). Hunting-nets were much in use among the Hebrews.   </li>
Nethaneel	<p>given of God. </p><li> The son of Zuar, chief of the tribe of Issachar at the Exodus ( Numbers 1:8 ;  2:5 ).  </li><li> One of David's brothers ( 1 Chronicles 2:14 ).  </li><li> A priest who blew the trumpet before the ark when it was brought up to Jerusalem ( 1 Chronicles 15:24 ).  </li><li> A Levite ( 1 Chronicles 24:6 ).  </li><li> A temple porter, of the family of the Korhites ( 1 Chronicles 26:4 ).  </li><li> One of the "princes" appointed by Jehoshaphat to teach the law through the cities of Judah ( 2 Chronicles 17:7 ).  </li><li> A chief Levite in the time of Josiah ( 2 Chronicles 35:9 ).  </li><li> Ezra 10:22 .  </li><li> Nehemiah 12:21 .  </li><li> A priest's son who bore a trumpet at the dedication of the walls of Jerusalem ( Nehemiah 12:36 ).   </li>
Nethaniah	<p>given of Jehovah. </p><li> One of Asaph's sons, appointed by David to minister in the temple ( 1 Chronicles 25:2 1 Chronicles 25:12 ).  </li><li> A Levite sent by Jehoshaphat to teach the law ( 2 Chronicles 17:8 ).  </li><li> Jeremiah 36:14 .  </li><li> 2 Kings 25:23 2 Kings 25:25 .   </li>
Nethinim	<p>the name given to the hereditary temple servants in all the post-Exilian books of Scripture. The word means given, i.e., "those set apart", viz., to the menial work of the sanctuary for the Levites. The name occurs seventeen times, and in each case in the Authorized Version incorrectly terminates in "s", "Nethinims;" in the Revised Version, correctly without the "s" ( Ezra 2:70 ;  Ezra 7:7 Ezra 7:24 ;  8:20 , etc.). The tradition is that the Gibeonites ( Joshua 9:27 ) were the original caste, afterwards called Nethinim. Their numbers were added to afterwards from captives taken in battle; and they were formally given by David to the Levites ( Ezra 8:20 ), and so were called Nethinim, i.e., the given ones, given to the Levites to be their servants. Only 612Nethinim returned from Babylon ( Ezra 2:58 ;  8:20 ). They were under the control of a chief from among themselves ( 2:43 ;  Nehemiah 7:46 ). No reference to them appears in the New Testament, because it is probable that they became merged in the general body of the Jewish people.  </p>
Netophah	<p>distillation; dropping, a town in Judah, in the neighbourhood, probably, of Bethlehem ( Nehemiah 7:26 ;  1 Chronicles 2:54 ). Two of David's guards were Netophathites ( 1 Chronicles 27:13 1 Chronicles 27:15 ). It has been identified with the ruins of Metoba, or Um Toba, to the north-east of Bethlehem.  </p>
Nettle	<p></p><li> Heb. haral, "pricking" or "burning," Prov 24:30,31(RSV marg., "wild vetches");  Job 30:7 ;  Zephaniah 2:9 . Many have supposed that some thorny or prickly plant is intended by this word, such as the bramble, the thistle, the wild plum, the cactus or prickly pear, etc. It may probably be a species of mustard, the Sinapis arvensis, which is a pernicious weed abounding in corn-fields. Tristram thinks that this word "designates the prickly acanthus (Acanthus spinosus), a very common and troublesome weed in the plains of Palestine."  </li><li> Heb. qimmosh,  Isaiah 34:13 ;  Hosea 9:6 ;  Proverbs 24:31  (in both versions, "thorns"). This word has been regarded as denoting thorns, thistles, wild camomile; but probably it is correctly rendered "nettle," the Urtica pilulifera, "a tall and vigorous plant, often 6 feet high, the sting of which is much more severe and irritating than that of our common nettle."   </li>
New Moon, Feast of	<p>Special services were appointed for the commencement of a month ( Numbers 28:11-15 ;  10:10 ). (See FESTIVALS .) </p>
New Testament	<p>( Luke 22:20 ), rather "New Covenant," in contrast to the old covenant of works, which is superseded. "The covenant of grace is called new; it succeeds to the old broken covenant of works. It is ever fresh, flourishing, and excellent; and under the gospel it is dispensed in a more clear, spiritual, extensive, and powerful manner than of old" (Brown of Haddington). Hence is derived the name given to the latter portion of the Bible. (See TESTAMENT .) </p>
Neziah	<p>victory; pure,  Ezra 2:54 ;  Nehemiah 7:56 .  </p>
Nezib	<p>a town in the "plain" of Judah. It has been identified with Beit Nuzib, about 14 miles south-west of Jerusalem, in the Wady Sur ( Joshua 15:43 ).  </p>
Nibhaz	<p>barker, the name of an idol, supposed to be an evil demon of the Zabians. It was set up in Samaria by the Avites ( 2 Kings 17:31 ), probably in the form of a dog.  </p>
Nibshan	<p>fertile; light soil, a city somewhere "in the wilderness" of Judah ( Joshua 15:62 ), probably near Engedi.  </p>
Nicanor	<p>conqueror, one of the seven deacons appointed in the apostolic Church ( Acts 6:1-6 ). Nothing further is known of him.  </p>
Nicodemus	<p>the people is victor, a Pharisee and a member of the Sanhedrin. He is first noticed as visiting Jesus by night ( John 3:1-21 ) for the purpose of learning more of his doctrines, which our Lord then unfolded to him, giving prominence to the necessity of being "born again." He is next met with in the Sanhedrin ( 7:50-52 ), where he protested against the course they were taking in plotting against Christ. Once more he is mentioned as taking part in the preparation for the anointing and burial of the body of Christ ( John 19:39 ). We hear nothing more of him. There can be little doubt that he became a true disciple.  </p>
Nicolaitanes	<p>The church at Ephesus ( Revelation 2:6 ) is commended for hating the "deeds" of the Nicolaitanes, and the church of Pergamos is blamed for having them who hold their "doctrines" (15). They were seemingly a class of professing Christians, who sought to introduce into the church a false freedom or licentiousness, thus abusing Paul's doctrine of grace (Compare  2 Peter 2:15 2 Peter 2:16 2 Peter 2:19 ), and were probably identical with those who held the doctrine of Baalam (q.v.),  Revelation 2:14 .  </p>
Nicolas	<p>the victory of the people, a proselyte of Antioch, one of the seven deacons ( Acts 6:5 ).  </p>
Nicopolis	<p>city of victory, where Paul intended to winter ( Titus 3:12 ). There were several cities of this name. The one here referred to was most probably that in Epirus, which was built by Augustus Caesar to commemorate his victory at the battle of Actium (B.C. 31). It is the modern Paleoprevesa, i.e., "Old Prevesa." The subscription to the epistle to Titus calls it "Nicopolis of Macedonia", i.e., of Thrace. This is, however, probably incorrect.  </p>
Niger	<p>black, a surname of Simeon ( Acts 13:1 ). He was probably so called from his dark complexion.  </p>
Night-hawk	<p>(Heb. tahmas) occurs only in the list of unclean birds ( Leviticus 11:16 ;  Deuteronomy 14:15 ). This was supposed to be the night-jar (Caprimulgus), allied to the swifts. The Hebrew word is derived from a root meaning "to scratch or tear the face," and may be best rendered, in accordance with the ancient versions, "an owl" (Strix flammea). The Revised Version renders "night-hawk."  </p>
Nile	<p>dark; blue, not found in Scripture, but frequently referred to in the Old Testament under the name of Sihor, i.e., "the black stream" ( Isaiah 23:3 ;  Jeremiah 2:18 ) or simply "the river" ( Genesis 41:1 ;  Exodus 1:22 , etc.) and the "flood of Egypt" ( Amos 8:8 ). It consists of two rivers, the White Nile, which takes its rise in the Victoria Nyanza, and the Blue Nile, which rises in the Abyssinian Mountains. These unite at the town of Khartoum, whence it pursues its course for 1,800 miles, and falls into the Mediterranean through its two branches, into which it is divided a few miles north of Cairo, the Rosetta and the Damietta branch. (See EGYPT .) </p>
Nimrah	<p>pure, a city on the east of Jordan ( Numbers 32:3 ); probably the same as Beth-nimrah ( Joshua 13:27 ). It has been identified with the Nahr Nimrin, at one of the fords of Jordan, not far from Jericho.  </p>
Nimrim, Waters of	<p>the stream of the leopards, a stream in Moab ( Isaiah 15:6 ;  Jeremiah 48:34 ); probably the modern Wady en-Nemeirah, a rich, verdant spot at the south-eastern end of the Dead Sea.  </p>
Nimrod	<p>firm, a descendant of Cush, the son of Ham. He was the first who claimed to be a "mighty one in the earth." Babel was the beginning of his kingdom, which he gradually enlarged ( Genesis 10:8-10 ). The "land of Nimrod" ( Micah 5:6 ) is a designation of Assyria or of Shinar, which is a part of it.  </p>
Nimshi	<p>saved. Jehu was "the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi" ( 2 Kings 9:2 ; Compare  1 Kings 19:16 ).  </p>
Nineveh	<p>First mentioned in  Genesis 10:11 , which is rendered in the Revised Version, "He [i.e., Nimrod] went forth into Assyria and builded Nineveh." It is not again noticed till the days of Jonah, when it is described ( Jonah 3:3 ;  4:11 ) as a great and populous city, the flourishing capital of the Assyrian empire ( 2 Kings 19:36 ;  Isaiah 37:37 ). The book of the prophet Nahum is almost exclusively taken up with prophetic denunciations against this city. Its ruin and utter desolation are foretold (Nah.1:14;  3:19 , etc.). Zephaniah also ( 2:13-15 ) predicts its destruction along with the fall of the empire of which it was the capital. From this time there is no mention of it in Scripture till it is named in gospel history ( Matthew 12:41 ;  Luke 11:32 ).  </p><p> This "exceeding great city" lay on the eastern or left bank of the river Tigris, along which it stretched for some 30 miles, having an average breadth of 10 miles or more from the river back toward the eastern hills. This whole extensive space is now one immense area of ruins. Occupying a central position on the great highway between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean, thus uniting the East and the West, wealth flowed into it from many sources, so that it became the greatest of all ancient cities.  </p><p> About B.C. 633 the Assyrian empire began to show signs of weakness, and Nineveh was attacked by the Medes, who subsequently, about B.C. 625, being joined by the Babylonians and Susianians, again attacked it, when it fell, and was razed to the ground. The Assyrian empire then came to an end, the Medes and Babylonians dividing its provinces between them. "After having ruled for more than six hundred years with hideous tyranny and violence, from the Caucasus and the Caspian to the Persian Gulf, and from beyond the Tigris to Asia Minor and Egypt, it vanished like a dream" ( Nahum 2:6-11 ). Its end was strange, sudden, tragic. It was God's doing, his judgement on Assyria's pride ( Isaiah 10:5-19 ).  </p><p> Forty years ago our knowledge of the great Assyrian empire and of its magnificent capital was almost wholly a blank. Vague memories had indeed survived of its power and greatness, but very little was definitely known about it. Other cities which had perished, as Palmyra, Persepolis, and Thebes, had left ruins to mark their sites and tell of their former greatness; but of this city, imperial Nineveh, not a single vestige seemed to remain, and the very place on which it had stood was only matter of conjecture. In fulfilment of prophecy, God made "an utter end of the place." It became a "desolation." </p><p> In the days of the Greek historian Herodotus, B.C. 400, it had become a thing of the past; and when Xenophon the historian passed the place in the "Retreat of the Ten Thousand," the very memory of its name had been lost. It was buried out of sight, and no one knew its grave. It is never again to rise from its ruins.  </p><p> At length, after being lost for more than two thousand years, the city was disentombed. A little more than forty years ago the French consul at Mosul began to search the vast mounds that lay along the opposite bank of the river. The Arabs whom he employed in these excavations, to their great surprise, came upon the ruins of a building at the mound of Khorsabad, which, on further exploration, turned out to be the royal palace of Sargon, one of the Assyrian kings. They found their way into its extensive courts and chambers, and brought forth form its hidded depths many wonderful sculptures and other relics of those ancient times. </p><p> The work of exploration has been carried on almost continuously by M. Botta, Sir Henry Layard, George Smith, and others, in the mounds of Nebi-Yunus, Nimrud, Koyunjik, and Khorsabad, and a vast treasury of specimens of old Assyrian art has been exhumed. Palace after palace has been discovered, with their decorations and their sculptured slabs, revealing the life and manners of this ancient people, their arts of war and peace, the forms of their religion, the style of their architecture, and the magnificence of their monarchs. The streets of the city have been explored, the inscriptions on the bricks and tablets and sculptured figures have been read, and now the secrets of their history have been brought to light. </p><p> One of the most remarkable of recent discoveries is that of the library of King Assur-bani-pal, or, as the Greek historians call him, Sardanapalos, the grandson of Sennacherib (q.v.). (See ASNAPPER .) This library consists of about ten thousand flat bricks or tablets, all written over with Assyrian characters. They contain a record of the history, the laws, and the religion of Assyria, of the greatest value. These strange clay leaves found in the royal library form the most valuable of all the treasuries of the literature of the old world. The library contains also old Accadian documents, which are the oldest extant documents in the world, dating as far back as probably about the time of Abraham. (See SARGON .) </p><p> "The Assyrian royalty is, perhaps, the most luxurious of our century [reign of Assur-bani-pa]...Its victories and conquests, uninterrupted for one hundred years, have enriched it with the spoil of twenty peoples. Sargon has taken what remained to the Hittites; Sennacherib overcame Chaldea, and the treasures of Babylon were transferred to his coffers; Esarhaddon and Assur-bani-pal himself have pillaged Egypt and her great cities, Sais, Memphis, and Thebes of the hundred gates...Now foreign merchants flock into Nineveh, bringing with them the most valuable productions from all countries, gold and perfume from South Arabia and the Chaldean Sea, Egyptian linen and glass-work, carved enamels, goldsmiths' work, tin, silver, Phoenician purple; cedar wood from Lebanon, unassailable by worms; furs and iron from Asia Minor and Armenia" (Ancient Egypt and Assyria, by G. Maspero, page 271).  </p><p> The bas-reliefs, alabaster slabs, and sculptured monuments found in these recovered palaces serve in a remarkable manner to confirm the Old Testament history of the kings of Israel. The appearance of the ruins shows that the destruction of the city was due not only to the assailing foe but also to the flood and the fire, thus confirming the ancient prophecies concerning it. "The recent excavations," says Rawlinson, "have shown that fire was a great instrument in the destruction of the Nineveh palaces. Calcined alabaster, charred wood, and charcoal, colossal statues split through with heat, are met with in parts of the Nineveh mounds, and attest the veracity of prophecy." </p><p> Nineveh in its glory was ( Jonah 3:4 ) an "exceeding great city of three days' journey", i.e., probably in circuit. This would give a circumference of about 60 miles. At the four corners of an irregular quadrangle are the ruins of Kouyunjik, Nimrud, Karamless and Khorsabad. These four great masses of ruins, with the whole area included within the parallelogram they form by lines drawn from the one to the other, are generally regarded as composing the whole ruins of Nineveh.  </p>
Nisan	<p>month of flowers, ( Nehemiah 2:1 ) the first month of the Jewish sacred year. (See ABIB .) Assyrian nisannu, "beginning." </p>
Nisroch	<p>probably connected with the Hebrew word <i> nesher</i> , an eagle. An Assyrian god, supposed to be that represented with the head of an eagle. Sennacherib was killed in the temple of this idol ( 2 Kings 19:37 ;  Isaiah 37:38 ).  </p>
Nitre	<p>( Proverbs 25:20 ; RSV marg., "soda"), properly "natron," a substance so called because, rising from the bottom of the Lake Natron in Egypt, it becomes dry and hard in the sun, and is the soda which effervesces when vinegar is poured on it. It is a carbonate of soda, not saltpetre, which the word generally denotes ( Jeremiah 2:22 ; RSV "lye").  </p>
No	<p>or No-A'mon, the home of Amon, the name of Thebes, the ancient capital of what is called the Middle Empire, in Upper or Southern Egypt. "The multitude of No" ( Jeremiah 46:25 ) is more correctly rendered, as in the Revised Version, "Amon of No", i.e., No, where Jupiter Amon had his temple. In Eze 30:14,16it is simply called "No;" but in ver. 15 the name has the Hebrew Hamon prefixed to it, "Hamon No." This prefix is probably the name simply of the god usually styled Amon or Ammon. In  Nahum 3:8  the "populous No" of the Authorized Version is in the Revised Version correctly rendered "No-Amon."  </p><p> It was the Diospolis or Thebes of the Greeks, celebrated for its hundred gates and its vast population. It stood on both sides of the Nile, and is by some supposed to have included Karnak and Luxor. In grandeur and extent it can only be compared to Nineveh. It is mentioned only in the prophecies referred to, which point to its total destruction. It was first taken by the Assyrians in the time of Sargon ( Isaiah 20 ). It was afterwards "delivered into the hand" of Nebuchadnezzar and Assurbani-pal ( Jeremiah 46:25 Jeremiah 46:26 ). Cambyses, king of the Persians (B.C. 525), further laid it waste by fire. Its ruin was completed (B.C. 81) by Ptolemy Lathyrus. The ruins of this city are still among the most notable in the valley of the Nile. They have formed a great storehouse of interesting historic remains for more than two thousand years. "As I wandered day after day with ever-growing amazement amongst these relics of ancient magnificence, I felt that if all the ruins in Europe, classical, Celtic, and medieval, were brought together into one centre, they would fall far short both in extent and grandeur of those of this single Egyptian city." Manning, The Land of the Pharaohs.  </p>
Noadiah	<p>meeting with the Lord. </p><li> A Levite who returned from Babylon ( Ezra 8:33 ).  </li><li> A false prophetess who assisted Tobiah and Sanballat against the Jews ( Nehemiah 6:14 ). Being bribed by them, she tried to stir up discontent among the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and so to embarrass Nehemiah in his great work of rebuilding the ruined walls of the city.   </li>
Noah	<p>rest, (Heb. Noah) the grandson of Methuselah ( Genesis 5:25-29 ), who was for two hundred and fifty years contemporary with Adam, and the son of Lamech, who was about fifty years old at the time of Adam's death. This patriarch is rightly regarded as the connecting link between the old and the new world. He is the second great progenitor of the human family.  </p><p> The words of his father Lamech at his birth ( Genesis 5:29 ) have been regarded as in a sense prophetical, designating Noah as a type of Him who is the true "rest and comfort" of men under the burden of life (Matt.11:28).  </p><p> He lived five hundred years, and then there were born unto him three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth ( Genesis 5:32 ). He was a "just man and perfect in his generation," and "walked with God" (Compare  Ezekiel 14:14 Ezekiel 14:20 ). But now the descendants of Cain and of Seth began to intermarry, and then there sprang up a race distinguished for their ungodliness. Men became more and more corrupt, and God determined to sweep the earth of its wicked population ( Genesis 6:7 ). But with Noah God entered into a covenant, with a promise of deliverance from the threatened deluge (18). He was accordingly commanded to build an ark ( 6:14-16 ) for the saving of himself and his house. An interval of one hundred and twenty years elapsed while the ark was being built ( 6:3 ), during which Noah bore constant testimony against the unbelief and wickedness of that generation ( 1 Peter 3:18-20 ;  2 Pet  2:5 ).  </p><p> When the ark of "gopher-wood" (mentioned only here) was at length completed according to the command of the Lord, the living creatures that were to be preserved entered into it; and then Noah and his wife and sons and daughters-in-law entered it, and the "Lord shut him in" (Gen.7:16). The judgment-threatened now fell on the guilty world, "the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished" ( 2 Peter 3:6 ). The ark floated on the waters for one hundred and fifty days, and then rested on the mountains of Ararat ( Genesis 8:3 Genesis 8:4 ); but not for a considerable time after this was divine permission given him to leave the ark, so that he and his family were a whole year shut up within it ( Genesis 614 -14).  </p><p> On leaving the ark Noah's first act was to erect an altar, the first of which there is any mention, and offer the sacrifices of adoring thanks and praise to God, who entered into a covenant with him, the first covenant between God and man, granting him possession of the earth by a new and special charter, which remains in force to the present time ( Genesis 8:21-9:17). ). As a sign and witness of this covenant, the rainbow was adopted and set apart by God, as a sure pledge that never again would the earth be destroyed by a flood.  </p><p> But, alas! Noah after this fell into grievous sin ( Genesis 9:21 ); and the conduct of Ham on this sad occasion led to the memorable prediction regarding his three sons and their descendants. Noah "lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years, and he died" ( 28:29 ). (See DELUGE).  </p><p> Noah, motion, (Heb. No'ah) one of the five daughters of Zelophehad (Num.26:33;  27:1 ;  36:11 ;  Joshua 17:3 ).  </p>
Nob	<p>high place, a city of the priests, first mentioned in the history of David's wanderings ( 1 Samuel 21:1 ). Here the tabernacle was then standing, and here Ahimelech the priest resided. (See AHIMELECH .) From  Isaiah 10:28-32  it seems to have been near Jerusalem. It has been identified by some with el-Isawiyeh, one mile and a half to the north-east of Jerusalem. But according to  Isaiah 10:28-32  it was on the south of Geba, on the road to Jerusalem, and within sight of the city. This identification does not meet these conditions, and hence others (as Dean Stanley) think that it was the northern summit of Mount Olivet, the place where David "worshipped God" when fleeing from Absalom ( 2 Samuel 15:32 ), or more probably (Conder) that it was the same as Mizpeh (q.v.),  Judges 20:1 ;  Joshua 18:26 ;  1 Samuel 7:16 , at Nebi Samwil, about 5 miles north-west of Jerusalem.  </p><p> After being supplied with the sacred loaves of showbread, and girding on the sword of Goliath, which was brought forth from behind the ephod, David fled from Nob and sought refuge at the court of Achish, the king of Gath, where he was cast into prison. (Compare titles of  Psalms 34  and 56.)  </p>
Nobah	<p>howling. </p><li> Numbers 32:42 .  </li><li> The name given to Kenath (q.v.) by Nobah when he conquered it. It was on the east of Gilead ( Judges 8:11 ).   </li>
Nobleman	<p>(Gr. basilikos, i.e., "king's man"), an officer of state ( John 4:49 ) in the service of Herod Antipas. He is supposed to have been the Chuza, Herod's steward, whose wife was one of those women who "ministered unto the Lord of their substance" ( Luke 8:3 ). This officer came to Jesus at Cana and besought him to go down to Capernaum and heal his son, who lay there at the point of death. Our Lord sent him away with the joyful assurance that his son was alive.  </p>
Nod	<p>exile; wandering; unrest, a name given to the country to which Cain fled (Gen.4:16). It lay on the east of Eden.  </p>
Nodab	<p>noble, probably a tribe descended from one of the sons of Ishmael, with whom the trans-Jordanic tribes made war (1Chr.5:19).  </p>
Nogah	<p>splendour, one of David's sons, born at Jerusalem ( 1 Chronicles 3:7 ).  </p>
Noph	<p>the Hebrew name of an Egyptian city ( Isaiah 19:13 ; ( Isaiah 44:1 ;  Isaiah 46:14  Isaiah 46:19 ;  Ezekiel 30:13 Ezekiel 30:16 ). In  Hosea 9:6  the Hebrew name is Moph, and is translated "Memphis," which is its Greek and Latin form. It was one of the most ancient and important cities of Egypt, and stood a little to the south of the modern Cairo, on the western bank of the Nile. It was the capital of Lower Egypt. Among the ruins found at this place is a colossal statue of Rameses the Great. (See MEMPHIS .) </p>
Nophah	<p>blast, a city of Moab which was occupied by the Amorites ( Numbers 21:30 ).  </p>
North country	<p>a general name for the countries that lay north of Palestine. Most of the invading armies entered Palestine from the north ( Isaiah 41:25 ;  Jeremiah 1:14 Jeremiah 1:15 ;  Jeremiah 50:3 Jeremiah 50:9 Jeremiah 50:41 ;  51:48 ;  Ezekiel 26:7 ).  </p>
Northward	<p>(Heb. tsaphon), a "hidden" or "dark place," as opposed to the sunny south ( Deuteronomy 3:27 ). A Hebrew in speaking of the points of the compass was considered as always having his face to the east, and hence "the left hand" ( Genesis 14:15 ;  Job 23:9 ) denotes the north. The "kingdoms of the north" are Chaldea, Assyria, Media, etc.  </p>
Nose-jewels	<p>Only mentioned in  Isaiah 3:21 , although refered to in  Genesis 24:47 ,  Proverbs 11:22 ,  Hosea 2:13 . They were among the most valued of ancient female ornaments. They "were made of ivory or metal, and occasionally jewelled. They were more than an inch in diameter, and hung upon the mouth. Eliezer gave one to Rebekah which was of gold and weighed half a shekel...At the present day the women in the country and in the desert wear these ornaments in one of the sides of the nostrils, which droop like the ears in consequence."  </p>
Numbering of the people	<p>Besides the numbering of the tribes mentioned in the history of the wanderings in the wilderness, we have an account of a general census of the whole nation from Dan to Beersheba, which David gave directions to Joab to make ( 1 Chronicles 21:1 ). Joab very reluctantly began to carry out the king's command.  </p><p> This act of David in ordering a numbering of the people arose from pride and a self-glorifying spirit. It indicated a reliance on his part on an arm of flesh, an estimating of his power not by the divine favour but by the material resources of his kingdom. He thought of military achievement and of conquest, and forgot that he was God's vicegerent. In all this he sinned against God. While Joab was engaged in the census, David's heart smote him, and he became deeply conscious of his fault; and in profound humiliation he confessed, "I have sinned greatly in what I have done." The prophet Gad was sent to him to put before him three dreadful alternatives ( 2 Samuel 24:13 ; for "seven years" in this verse, the LXX. and  1 Chronicles 21:12  have "three years"), three of Jehovah's four sore judgments ( Ezekiel 14:21 ). Two of these David had already experienced. He had fled for some months before Absalom, and had suffered three years' famine on account of the slaughter of the Gibeonites. In his "strait" David said, "Let me fall into the hands of the Lord." A pestilence broke out among the people, and in three days swept away 70,000. At David's intercession the plague was stayed, and at the threshing-floor of Araunah (q.v.), where the destroying angel was arrested in his progress, David erected an altar, and there offered up sacrifies to God ( 2 Chronicles 3:1 ).  </p><p> The census, so far as completed, showed that there were at least 1,300,000 fighting men in the kingdom, indicating at that time a population of about six or seven millions in all. (See CENSUS .) </p>
Numbers, Book of	<p>the fourth of the books of the Pentateuch, called in the Hebrew be-midbar, i.e., "in the wilderness." In the LXX. version it is called "Numbers," and this name is now the usual title of the book. It is so called because it contains a record of the numbering of the people in the wilderness of Sinai (1-4), and of their numbering afterwards on the plain of Moab (26).  </p><p> This book is of special historical interest as furnishing us with details as to the route of the Israelites in the wilderness and their principal encampments. It may be divided into three parts: </p><p> 1. The numbering of the people at Sinai, and preparations for their resuming their march ( (1-10:10). ). The sixth chapter gives an account of the vow of a Nazarite.  </p><p> 2. An account of the journey from Sinai to Moab, the sending out of the spies and the report they brought back, and the murmurings (eight times) of the people at the hardships by the way ( (10:11-21:20). ).  </p><p> 3. The transactions in the plain of Moab before crossing the Jordan (21:21-ch. 36).  </p><p> The period comprehended in the history extends from the second month of the second year after the Exodus to the beginning of the eleventh month of the fortieth year, in all about thirty-eight years and ten months; a dreary period of wanderings, during which that disobedient generation all died in the wilderness. They were fewer in number at the end of their wanderings than when they left the land of Egypt. We see in this history, on the one hand, the unceasing care of the Almighty over his chosen people during their wanderings; and, on the other hand, the murmurings and rebellions by which they offended their heavenly Protector, drew down repeated marks of his displeasure, and provoked him to say that they should "not enter into his rest" because of their unbelief ( Hebrews 3:19 ).  </p><p> This, like the other books of the Pentateuch, bears evidence of having been written by Moses. </p><p> The expression "the book of the wars of the Lord," occurring in  21:14 , has given rise to much discussion. But, after all, "what this book was is uncertain, whether some writing of Israel not now extant, or some writing of the Amorites which contained songs and triumphs of their king Sihon's victories, out of which Moses may cite this testimony, as Paul sometimes does out of heathen poets ( Acts 17:28 ;  Titus 1:12 )."  </p>
Nun	<p>Beyond the fact that he was the father of Joshua nothing more is known of him ( Exodus 33:11 ).  </p>
Nuts	<p>were among the presents Jacob sent into Egypt for the purpose of conciliating Joseph ( Genesis 43:11 ). This was the fruit of the pistachio tree, which resembles the sumac. It is of the size of an olive. In Cant  6:11  a different Hebrew word ('egoz), which means "walnuts," is used.  </p>
Nymphas	<p>nymph, saluted by Paul in his Epistle to the Colossians as a member of the church of Laodicea ( Colossians 4:15 ).  </p>
Onion	<p>The Israelites in the wilderness longed for the "onions and garlick of Egypt" ( Numbers 11:5 ). This was the <i> betsel</i> of the Hebrews, the Allium cepe of botanists, of which it is said that there are some thirty or forty species now growing in Palestine. The onion is "the 'undivided' leek, <i> unio_, _unus</i> , one." </p>
Ono	<p>a town of Benjamin, in the "plain of Ono" ( 1 Chronicles 8:12 ;  Ezra 2:33 ); now Kefr 'Ana, 5 miles north of Lydda, and about 30 miles north-west of Jerusalem. Not succeeding in their attempts to deter Nehemiah from rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem, Sanballat and Tobiah resorted to strategem, and pretending to wish a conference with him, they invited him to meet them at Ono. Four times they made the request, and every time Nehemiah refused to come. Their object was to take him prisoner.  </p>
Onycha	<p>a nail; claw; hoof, (Heb. sheheleth;  Exodus 30:34 ), a Latin word applied to the operculum, i.e., the claw or nail of the strombus or wing-shell, a univalve common in the Red Sea. The opercula of these shell-fish when burned emit a strong odour "like castoreum." This was an ingredient in the sacred incense.  </p>
Onyx	<p>a hail; claw; hoof, (Heb. shoham), a precious stone adorning the breast-plate of the high priest and the shoulders of the ephod ( Exodus 28:9-12 Exodus 28:20 ;  35:27 ;  Job 28:16 ;  Ezekiel 28:13 ). It was found in the land of Havilah ( Genesis 2:12 ). The LXX. translates the Hebrew word by smaragdos, an emerald. Some think that the sardonyx is meant. But the onyx differs from the sardonyx in this, that while the latter has two layers (black and white) the former has three (black, white, and red).  </p>
Open place	<p> Genesis 38:14 Genesis 38:21 , mar. Enaim; the same probably as Enam ( Joshua 15:34 ), a city in the lowland or Shephelah.  </p>
Ophel	<p>hill; mound, the long, narrow, rounded promontory on the southern slope of the temple hill, between the Tyropoeon and the Kedron valley ( 2 Chronicles 27:3 ;  33:14 ;  Nehemiah 3:26 Nehemiah 3:27 ). It was surrounded by a separate wall, and was occupied by the Nethinim after the Captivity. This wall has been discovered by the engineers of the Palestine Exploration Fund at the south-eastern angle of the temple area. It is 4 feet below the present surface. In  2 Kings 5:24  this word is translated "tower" (RSV, "hill"), denoting probably some eminence near Elisha's house.  </p>
Ophir	<p></p><li> One of the sons of Joktan ( Genesis 10:29 ).  </li><li> Some region famous for its gold ( 1 Kings 9:28 ;  10:11 ;  22:48 ;  Job 22:24 ;  28:16 ;  Isaiah 13:12 ). In the LXX. this word is rendered "Sophir," and "Sofir" is the Coptic name for India, which is the rendering of the Arabic version, as also of the Vulgate. Josephus has identified it with the Golden Chersonese, i.e., the Malay peninsula. It is now generally identified with Abhira, at the mouth of the Indus. Much may be said, however, in favour of the opinion that it was somewhere in Arabia.   </li>
Ophni	<p>mouldy, a city of Benjamin ( Joshua 18:24 ).  </p>
Ophrah	<p>a fawn.  1 Chronicles 4:14 . </p><li> A city of Benjamin ( Joshua 18:23 ); probably identical with Ephron ( 2 Chronicles 13:19 ) and Ephraim ( John 11:54 ).  </li><li> "Of the Abi-ezrites." A city of Manasseh, 6 miles south-west of Shechem, the residence of Gideon ( Judges 6:11 ;  Judges 8:27 Judges 8:32 ). After his great victory over the Midianites, he slew at this place the captive kings ( 8:18-21 ). He then assumed the function of high priest, and sought to make Ophrah what Shiloh should have been. This thing "became a snare" to Gideon and his house. After Gideon's death his family resided here till they were put to death by Abimelech ( Judges 9:5 ). It is identified with Ferata.   </li>
Oracle	<p>In the Old Testament used in every case, except  2 Samuel 16:23 , to denote the most holy place in the temple ( 1 Kings 6:5 1 Kings 6:19-23 ;  8:6 ). In  2 Samuel 16:23  it means the Word of God. A man inquired "at the oracle of God" by means of the Urim and Thummim in the breastplate on the high priest's ephod. In the New Testament it is used only in the plural, and always denotes the Word of God ( Romans 3:2 ;  Hebrews 5:12 , etc.). The Scriptures are called "living oracles" (Compare  Hebrews 4:12 ) because of their quickening power ( Acts 7:38 ).  </p>
Oreb	<p>raven, a prince of Midian, who, being defeated by Gideon and put to straits, was slain along with Zeeb ( Judges 7:20-25 ). Many of the Midianites perished along with him ( Psalms 83:9 ;  Isaiah 10:26 ).  </p>
Oreb, The rock of	<p>the place where Gideon slew Oreb after the defeat of the Midianites ( Judges 7:25 ;  Isaiah 10:26 ). It was probably the place now called Orbo, on the east of Jordan, near Bethshean.  </p>
Oren	<p>ash or pine, the son of Jerahmeel ( 1 Chronicles 2:25 ).  </p>
Organ	<p>some kind of wind instrument, probably a kind of Pan's pipes ( Genesis 4:21 ;  Job 21:12 ;  Psalms 150:4 ), which consisted of seven or eight reeds of unequal length.  </p>
Orion	<p>Heb. Kesil; i.e., "the fool", the name of a constellation ( Job 9:9 ;  38:31 ;  Amos 5:8 ) consisting of about eighty stars. The Vulgate renders thus, but the LXX. renders by Hesperus, i.e., "the evening-star," Venus. The Orientals "appear to have conceived of this constellation under the figure of an impious giant bound upon the sky." This giant was, according to tradition, Nimrod, the type of the folly that contends against God. In  Isaiah 13:10  the plural form of the Hebrew word is rendered "constellations."  </p>
Ornan	<p> 1 Chronicles 21:15 . (See ARAUNAH .) </p>
Orpah	<p>forelock or fawn, a Moabitess, the wife of Chilion ( Ruth 1:4 ;  4:10 ). On the death of her husband she accompanied Naomi, her mother-in-law, part of the way to Bethlehem, and then returned to Moab.  </p>
Orphans	<p>( Lamentations 5:3 ), i.e., desolate and without protectors. The word occurs only here. In  John 14:18  the word there rendered "comfortless" (RSV, "desolate;" marg., "orphans") properly means "orphans." The same Greek word is rendered "fatherless" in  James 1:27 .  </p>
Osprey	<p>Heb. 'ozniyyah, an unclean bird according to the Mosaic law ( Leviticus 11:13 ;  Deuteronomy 14:12 ); the fish-eating eagle (Pandion haliaetus); one of the lesser eagles. But the Hebrew word may be taken to denote the short-toed eagle (Circaetus gallicus of Southern Europe), one of the most abundant of the eagle tribe found in Palestine.  </p>
Ossifrage	<p>Heb. peres = to "break" or "crush", the lammer-geier, or bearded vulture, the largest of the whole vulture tribe. It was an unclean bird ( Leviticus 11:13 ;  Deuteronomy 14:12 ). It is not a gregarious bird, and is found but rarely in Palestine. "When the other vultures have picked the flesh off any animal, he comes in at the end of the feast, and swallows the bones, or breaks them, and swallows the pieces if he cannot otherwise extract the marrow. The bones he cracks [hence the appropriateness of the name ossifrage, i.e., "bone-breaker"] by letting them fall on a rock from a great height. He does not, however, confine himself to these delicacies, but whenever he has an opportunity will devour lambs, kids, or hares. These he generally obtains by pushing them over cliffs, when he has watched his opportunity; and he has been known to attack men while climbing rocks, and dash them against the bottom. But tortoises and serpents are his ordinary food...No doubt it was a lammer-geier that mistook the bald head of the poet AEschylus for a stone, and dropped on it the tortoise which killed him" (Tristram's Nat. Hist.).  </p>
Ostrich	<p>( Lamentations 4:3 ), the rendering of Hebrew pl. enim; so called from its greediness and gluttony. The allusion here is to the habit of the ostrich with reference to its eggs, which is thus described: "The outer layer of eggs is generally so ill covered that they are destroyed in quantities by jackals, wild-cats, etc., and that the natives carry them away, only taking care not to leave the marks of their footsteps, since, when the ostrich comes and finds that her nest is discovered, she crushes the whole brood, and builds a nest elsewhere." In  Job 39:13  this word in the Authorized Version is the rendering of a Hebrew word (notsah) which means "feathers," as in the Revised Version. In the same verse the word "peacocks" of the Authorized Version is the rendering of the Hebrew pl. renanim, properly meaning "ostriches," as in the Revised Version. (See OWL [1].)  </p>
Othni	<p>a lion of Jehovah, a son of Shemaiah, and one of the temple porters in the time of David ( 1 Chronicles 26:7 ). He was a "mighty man of valour."  </p>
Othniel	<p>lion of God, the first of the judges. His wife Achsah was the daughter of Caleb ( Joshua 15:16 Joshua 15:17 ;  Judges 1:13 ). He gained her hand as a reward for his bravery in leading a successful expedition against Debir (q.v.). Some thirty years after the death of Joshua, the Israelites fell under the subjection of Chushan-rishathaim (q.v.), the king of Mesopotamia. He oppressed them for full eight years, when they "cried" unto Jehovah, and Othniel was raised up to be their deliverer. He was the younger brother of Caleb ( Judges 3:8 Judges 3:9-11 ). He is the only judge mentioned connected with the tribe of Judah. Under him the land had rest forty years.  </p>
Ouches	<p>an Old English word denoting cavities or sockets in which gems were set ( Exodus 28:11 ).  </p>
Oven	<p>Heb. tannur, ( Hosea 7:4 ). In towns there appear to have been public ovens. There was a street in Jerusalem ( Jeremiah 37:21 ) called "bakers' street" (the only case in which the name of a street in Jerusalem is preserved). The words "tower of the furnaces" ( Nehemiah 3:11 ;  12:38 ) is more properly "tower of the ovens" (Heb. tannurim). These resemble the ovens in use among ourselves.  </p><p> There were other private ovens of different kinds. Some were like large jars made of earthenware or copper, which were heated inside with wood ( 1 Kings 17:12 ;  Isaiah 44:15 ;  Jeremiah 7:18 ) or grass ( Matthew 6:30 ), and when the fire had burned out, small pieces of dough were placed inside or spread in thin layers on the outside, and were thus baked. (See FURNACE .) </p><p> Pits were also formed for the same purposes, and lined with cement. These were used after the same manner. </p><p> Heated stones, or sand heated by a fire heaped over it, and also flat irons pans, all served as ovens for the preparation of bread. (See   Genesis 18:6 ;  1 Kings 19:6 .)  </p>
Owl	<p></p><li> Heb. bath-haya'anah, "daughter of greediness" or of "shouting." In the list of unclean birds ( Leviticus 11:16 ;  Deuteronomy 14:15 ); also mentioned in  Job 30:29 ;  Isaiah 13:21 ;  34:13 ;  43:20 ;  Jeremiah 50:39 ;  Micah 1:8 . In all these passages the Revised Version translates "ostrich" (q.v.), which is the correct rendering.  </li><li> Heb. yanshuph, rendered "great owl" in  Leviticus 11:17 ;  Deuteronomy 14:16 , and "owl" in  Isaiah 34:11 . This is supposed to be the Egyptian eagle-owl (Bubo ascalaphus), which takes the place of the eagle-owl (Bubo maximus) found in Southern Europe. It is found frequenting the ruins of Egypt and also of the Holy Land. "Its cry is a loud, prolonged, and very powerful hoot. I know nothing which more vividly brought to my mind the sense of desolation and loneliness than the re-echoing hoot of two or three of these great owls as I stood at midnight among the ruined temples of Baalbek" (Tristram).  <p> The LXX. and Vulgate render this word by "ibis", i.e., the Egyptian heron. </p></li><li> Heb. kos, rendered "little owl" in  Leviticus 11:17 ;  Deuteronomy 14:16 , and "owl" in  Psalms 102:6 . The Arabs call this bird "the mother of ruins." It is by far the most common of all the owls of Palestine. It is the Athene persica, the bird of Minerva, the symbol of ancient Athens.  </li><li> Heb. kippoz, the "great owl" ( Isaiah 34:15 ); Revised Version, "arrow-snake;" LXX. and Vulgate, "hedgehog," reading in the text, kippod, instead of kippoz. There is no reason to doubt the correctness of the rendering of the Authorized Version. Tristram says: "The word [i.e., kippoz] is very possibly an imitation of the cry of the scops owl (Scops giu), which is very common among ruins, caves, and old walls of towns...It is a migrant, returning to Palestine in spring."  </li><li> Heb. lilith, "screech owl" ( Isaiah 34:14 , marg. and RSV, "night monster"). The Hebrew word is from a root signifying "night." Some species of the owl is obviously intended by this word. It may be the hooting or tawny owl (Syrnium aluco), which is common in Egypt and in many parts of Palestine. This verse in Isaiah is "descriptive of utter and perpetual desolation, of a land that should be full of ruins, and inhabited by the animals that usually make such ruins their abode."   </li>
Ox	<p>Heb. bakar, "cattle;" "neat cattle", ( Genesis 12:16 ;  34:28 ;  Job 1:3 Job 1:14 ;  42:12 , etc.); not to be muzzled when treading the corn ( Deuteronomy 25:4 ). Referred to by our Lord in his reproof to the Pharisees ( Luke 13:15 ;  14:5 ).  </p>
Ox goad	<p>mentioned only in  Judges 3:31 , the weapon with which Shamgar (q.v.) slew six hundred Philistines. "The ploughman still carries his goad, a weapon apparently more fitted for the hand of the soldier than the peaceful husbandman. The one I saw was of the 'oak of Bashan,' and measured upwards of ten feet in length. At one end was an iron spear, and at the other a piece of the same metal flattened. One can well understand how a warrior might use such a weapon with effect in the battle-field" (Porter's Syria, etc.). (See GOAD .) </p>
Ozem	<p>strong. </p><li> One of David's brothers; the sixth son of Jesse ( 1 Chronicles 2:15 ).  </li><li> A son of Jerahmeel ( 1 Chronicles 2:25 ).   </li>
Ozias	<p>son of Joram ( Matthew 1:8 ); called also Uzziah ( 2 Kings 15:32 2 Kings 15:34 ).  </p>
Ozni	<p>hearing, one of the sons of Gad; also called Ezbon ( Genesis 46:16 ;  Numbers 26:16 ).  </p>
Pharisees	<p>separatists (Heb. persahin, from parash, "to separate"). They were probably the successors of the Assideans (i.e., the "pious"), a party that originated in the time of Antiochus Epiphanes in revolt against his heathenizing policy. The first mention of them is in a description by Josephus of the three sects or schools into which the Jews were divided (B.C. 145). The other two sects were the Essenes and the Sadducees. In the time of our Lord they were the popular party ( John 7:48 ). They were extremely accurate and minute in all matters appertaining to the law of Moses ( Matthew 9:14 ;  23:15 ;  Luke 11:39 ;  18:12 ). Paul, when brought before the council of Jerusalem, professed himself a Pharisee ( Acts 23:6-8 ;  Acts 26:4 Acts 26:5 ).  </p><p> There was much that was sound in their creed, yet their system of religion was a form and nothing more. Theirs was a very lax morality ( Matthew 5:20 ;  Matthew 15:4 Matthew 15:8 ;  Matthew 23:3  Matthew 23:14  Matthew 23:23 Matthew 23:25 ;  John 8:7 ). On the first notice of them in the New Testament ( Matthew 3:7 ), they are ranked by our Lord with the Sadducees as a "generation of vipers." They were noted for their self-righteousness and their pride ( Matthew 9:11 ;  Luke 7:39 ;  Luke 18:11 Luke 18:12 ). They were frequently rebuked by our Lord ( Matthew 12:39 ;  16:1-4 ).  </p><p> From the very beginning of his ministry the Pharisees showed themselves bitter and persistent enemies of our Lord. They could not bear his doctrines, and they sought by every means to destroy his influence among the people. </p>
Pharpar	<p>swift, one of the rivers of Damascus ( 2 Kings 5:12 ). It has been identified with the 'Awaj, "a small lively river." The whole of the district watered by the 'Awaj is called the Wady el-'Ajam, i.e., "the valley of the Persians", so called for some unknown reason. This river empties itself into the lake or marsh Bahret Hijaneh, on the east of Damascus. One of its branches bears the modern name of Wady Barbar, which is probably a corruption of Pharpar.  </p>
Phebe	<p>a "deaconess of the church at Cenchrea," the port of Corinth. She was probably the bearer of Paul's epistle to the Romans. Paul commended her to the Christians at Rome; "for she hath been," says he, "a succourer of many, and of myself also" ( Romans 16:1 Romans 16:2 ).  </p>
Phenice	<p>properly Phoenix a palm-tree (as in the RSV), a town with a harbour on the southern side of Crete ( Acts 27:12 ), west of the Fair Havens. It is now called Lutro.  </p>
Phenicia	<p>( Acts 21:2 ) = Phenice ( 11:19 ;  15:3 ; RSV, Phoenicia), Gr. phoinix, "a palm", the land of palm-trees; a strip of land of an average breadth of about 20 miles along the shores of the Mediterranean, from the river Eleutherus in the north to the promotory of Carmel in the south, about 120 miles in length. This name is not found in the Old Testament, and in the New Testament it is mentioned only in the passages above referred to.  </p><p> "In the Egyptian inscriptions Phoenicia is called Keft, the inhabitants being Kefa; and since Keft-ur, or 'Greater Phoenicia,' was the name given to the delta of the Nile from the Phoenician colonies settled upon it, the Philistines who came from Caphtor or Keft-ur must have been of Phoenician origin" (Compare  Deuteronomy 2:23 ;  Jeremiah 47:4 ;  Amos 9:7 )., Sayce's Bible and the Monuments.  </p><p> Phoenicia lay in the very centre of the old world, and was the natural entrepot for commerce with foreign nations. It was the "England of antiquity." "The trade routes from all Asia converged on the Phoenician coast; the centres of commerce on the Euphrates and Tigris forwarding their goods by way of Tyre to the Nile, to Arabia, and to the west; and, on the other hand, the productions of the vast regions bordering the Mediterranean passing through the Canaanite capital to the eastern world." It was "situate at the entry of the sea, a merchant of the people for many isles" ( Ezekiel 27:3 Ezekiel 27:4 ). The far-reaching commercial activity of the Phoenicians, especially with Tarshish and the western world, enriched them with vast wealth, which introduced boundless luxury and developed among them a great activity in all manner of arts and manufactures. (See TYRE .) </p><p> The Phoenicians were the most enterprising merchants of the old world, establishing colonies at various places, of which Carthage was the chief. They were a Canaanite branch of the race of Ham, and are frequently called Sidonians, from their principal city of Sidon. None could "skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians" ( 1 Kings 5:6 ). King Hiram rendered important service to Solomon in connection with the planning and building of the temple, casting for him all the vessels for the temple service, and the two pillars which stood in the front of the porch, and "the molten sea" ( 1 Kings 7:21-23 ). Singular marks have been found by recent exploration on the great stones that form the substructure of the temple. These marks, both painted and engraved, have been regarded as made by the workmen in the quarries, and as probably intended to indicate the place of these stones in the building. "The Biblical account ( 1 Kings 5:17 1 Kings 5:18 ) is accurately descriptive of the massive masonry now existing at the south-eastern angle (of the temple area), and standing on the native rock 80 feet below the present surface. The Royal Engineers found, buried deeply among the rubbish of many centuries, great stones, costly and hewed stones, forming the foundation of the sanctuary wall; while Phoenician fragments of pottery and Phoenician marks painted on the massive blocks seem to proclaim that the stones were prepared in the quarry by the cunning workmen of Hiram, the king of Tyre." (See TEMPLE .) </p><p> The Phoenicians have been usually regarded as the inventors of alphabetic writing. The Egyptians expressed their thoughts by certain symbols, called "hieroglyphics", i.e., sacred carvings, so styled because used almost exclusively on sacred subjects. The recent discovery, however, of inscriptions in Southern Arabia (Yemen and Hadramaut), known as Hemyaritic, in connection with various philogical considerations, has led some to the conclusion that the Phoenician alphabet was derived from the Mineans (admitting the antiquity of the kingdom of Ma'in, Judg.  10:12 ;  2 Chr  <span class="badLink">26:7</span> ). Thus the Phoenician alphabet ceases to be the mother alphabet. Sayce thinks "it is more than possible that the Egyptians themselves were emigrants from Southern Arabia." (See MOABITE  STONE .) </p><p> "The Phoenicians were renowned in ancient times for the manufacture of glass, and some of the specimens of this work that have been preserved are still the wonder of mankind...In the matter of shipping, whether ship-building be thought of or traffic upon the sea, the Phoenicians surpassed all other nations." "The name Phoenicia is of uncertain origin, though it may be derived from Fenkhu, the name given in the Egyptian inscriptions to the natives of Palestine. Among the chief Phoenician cities were Tyre and Sidon, Gebal north of Beirut, Arvad or Arados and Zemar." </p>
Phicol	<p>great, the chief captain of the army of Abimelech, the Philistine king of Gerar. He entered into an alliance with Abraham with reference to a certain well which, from this circumstance, was called Beersheba (q.v.), "the well of the oath" ( Genesis 21:22 Genesis 21:32 ;  26:26 ).  </p>
Philadelphia	<p>brotherly love, a city of Lydia in Asia Minor, about 25 miles south-east of Sardis. It was the seat of one of the "seven churches" ( Revelation 3:7-12 ). It came into the possession of the Turks in A.D. 1392. It has several times been nearly destroyed by earthquakes. It is still a town of considerable size, called Allahshehr, "the city of God."  </p>
Philemon	<p>an inhabitant of Colosse, and apparently a person of some note among the citizens ( Colossians 4:9 ;  Philemon 1:2 ). He was brought to a knowledge of the gospel through the instrumentality of Paul (19), and held a prominent place in the Christian community for his piety and beneficence (4-7). He is called in the epistle a "fellow-labourer," and therefore probably held some office in the church at Colosse; at all events, the title denotes that he took part in the work of spreading a knowledge of the gospel.  </p>
Philemon, Epistle to	<p>was written from Rome at the same time as the epistles to the Colossians and Ephesians, and was sent also by Onesimus. It was addressed to Philemon and the members of his family. </p><p> It was written for the purpose of interceding for Onesimus (q.v.), who had deserted his master Philemon and been "unprofitable" to him. Paul had found Onesimus at Rome, and had there been instrumental in his conversion, and now he sends him back to his master with this letter. </p><p> This epistle has the character of a strictly private letter, and is the only one of such epistles preserved to us. "It exhibits the apostle in a new light. He throws off as far as possible his apostolic dignity and his fatherly authority over his converts. He speaks simply as Christian to Christian. He speaks, therefore, with that peculiar grace of humility and courtesy which has, under the reign of Christianity, developed the spirit of chivalry and what is called 'the character of a gentleman,' certainly very little known in the old Greek and Roman civilization" (Dr. Barry). (See SLAVE .) </p>
Philetus	<p>amiable, with Hymenaeus, at Ephesus, said that the "resurrection was past already" ( 2 Timothy 2:17 2 Timothy 2:18 ). This was a Gnostic heresy held by the Nicolaitanes. (See ALEXANDER [4].)  </p>
Philip	<p>lover of horses. </p><li> One of the twelve apostles; a native of Bethsaida, "the city of Andrew and Peter" ( John 1:44 ). He readily responded to the call of Jesus when first addressed to him (43), and forthwith brought Nathanael also to Jesus (45,46). He seems to have held a prominent place among the apostles ( Matthew 10:3 ;  Mark 3:18 ;  John 6:5-7 ;  John 12:21 John 12:22 ;  John 14:8 John 14:9 ;  Acts 1:13 ). Of his later life nothing is certainly known. He is said to have preached in Phrygia, and to have met his death at Hierapolis.  </li><li> One of the "seven" ( Acts 6:5 ), called also "the evangelist" ( Acts 21:8 Acts 21:9 ). He was one of those who were "scattered abroad" by the persecution that arose on the death of Stephen. He went first to Samaria, where he laboured as an evangelist with much success ( 8:5-13 ). While he was there he received a divine command to proceed toward the south, along the road leading from Jerusalem to Gaza. These towns were connected by two roads. The one Philip was directed to take was that which led through Hebron, and thence through a district little inhabited, and hence called "desert." As he travelled along this road he was overtaken by a chariot in which sat a man of Ethiopia, the eunuch or chief officer of Queen Candace, who was at that moment reading, probably from the Septuagint version, a portion of the prophecies of ( Isaiah 53:6 Isaiah 53:7 ). Philip entered into conversation with him, and expounded these verses, preaching to him the glad tidings of the Saviour. The eunuch received the message and believed, and was forthwith baptized, and then "went on his way rejoicing." Philip was instantly caught away by the Spirit after the baptism, and the eunuch saw him no more. He was next found at Azotus, whence he went forth in his evangelistic work till he came to Caesarea. He is not mentioned again for about twenty years, when he is still found at Caesarea ( Acts 21:8 ) when Paul and his companions were on the way to Jerusalem. He then finally disappears from the page of history.  </li><li> Mentioned only in connection with the imprisonment of John the Baptist ( Matthew 14:3 ;  Mark 6:17 ;  Luke 3:19 ). He was the son of Herod the Great, and the first husband of Herodias, and the father of Salome. (See HEROD PHILIP I.)  </li><li> The "tetrarch of Ituraea" ( Luke 3:1 ); a son of Herod the Great, and brother of Herod Antipas. The city of Caesarea-Philippi was named partly after him ( Matthew 16:13 ;  Mark 8:27 ). (See HEROD PHILIP II.)   </li>
Philippi	<p></p><li> Formerly Crenides, "the fountain," the capital of the province of Macedonia. It stood near the head of the Sea, about 8 miles north-west of Kavalla. It is now a ruined village, called Philibedjik. Philip of Macedonia fortified the old Thracian town of Crenides, and called it after his own name Philippi (B.C. 359-336). In the time of the Emperor Augustus this city became a Roman colony, i.e., a military settlement of Roman soldiers, there planted for the purpose of controlling the district recently conquered. It was a "miniature Rome," under the municipal law of Rome, and governed by military officers, called duumviri, who were appointed directly from Rome. Having been providentially guided thither, here Paul and his companion Silas preached the gospel and formed the first church in Europe. (See LYDIA .) This success stirred up the enmity of the people, and they were "shamefully entreated" ( Acts 16:9-40 ;  1 Thessalonians 2:2 ). Paul and Silas at length left this city and proceeded to Amphipolis (q.v.).  </li><li> When Philip the tetrarch, the son of Herod, succeeded to the government of the northern portion of his kingdom, he enlarged the city of Paneas, and called it Caesarea, in honour of the emperor. But in order to distinguish it from the Caesarea on the sea coast, he added to it subsequently his own name, and called it Caesarea-Philippi (q.v.).   </li>
Philippians, Epistle to	<p>was written by Paul during the two years when he was "in bonds" in Rome (Phil  1:7-13 ), probably early in the year A.D. 62 or in the end of 61.  </p><p> The Philippians had sent Epaphroditus, their messenger, with contributions to meet the necessities of the apostle; and on his return Paul sent back with him this letter. With this precious communication Epaphroditus sets out on his homeward journey. "The joy caused by his return, and the effect of this wonderful letter when first read in the church of Philippi, are hidden from us. And we may almost say that with this letter the church itself passes from our view. To-day, in silent meadows, quiet cattle browse among the ruins which mark the site of what was once the flourishing Roman colony of Philippi, the home of the most attractive church of the apostolic age. But the name and fame and spiritual influence of that church will never pass. To myriads of men and women in every age and nation the letter written in a dungeon at Rome, and carried along the Egnatian Way by an obscure Christian messenger, has been a light divine and a cheerful guide along the most rugged paths of life" (Professor Beet). </p><p> The church at Philippi was the first-fruits of European Christianity. Their attachment to the apostle was very fervent, and so also was his affection for them. They alone of all the churches helped him by their contributions, which he gratefully acknowledges ( Acts 20:33-35 ;  2 co  11:7-12 ;  2 th  3:8 ). The pecuniary liberality of the Philippians comes out very conspicuously (Phil  4:15 ). "This was a characteristic of the Macedonian missions, as  2 Corinthians 8  and 9 amply and beautifully prove. It is remarkable that the Macedonian converts were, as a class, very poor ( 2 Corinthians 8:2 ); and the parallel facts, their poverty and their open-handed support of the great missionary and his work, are deeply harmonious. At the present day the missionary liberality of poor Christians is, in proportion, really greater than that of the rich" (Moule's Philippians, Introd.).  </p><p> The contents of this epistle give an interesting insight into the condition of the church at Rome at the time it was written. Paul's imprisonment, we are informed, was no hindrance to his preaching the gospel, but rather "turned out to the furtherance of the gospel." The gospel spread very extensively among the Roman soldiers, with whom he was in constant contact, and the Christians grew into a "vast multitude." It is plain that Christianity was at this time making rapid advancement in Rome. </p><p> The doctrinal statements of this epistle bear a close relation to those of the Epistle to the Romans. Compare also Phil  3:20  with  Ephesians 2:12 Ephesians 2:19 , where the church is presented under the idea of a city or commonwealth for the first time in Paul's writings. The personal glory of Christ is also set forth in almost parallel forms of expression in Phil  2:5-11 , compared with  Ephesians 1:17-23 ;  2:8 ; and  Colossians 1:15-20 . "This exposition of the grace and wonder of His personal majesty, personal self-abasement, and personal exaltation after it," found in these epistles, "is, in a great measure, a new development in the revelations given through St. Paul" (Moule). Other minuter analogies in forms of expression and of thought are also found in these epistles of the Captivity.  </p>
Philistia	<p>=Palestine (q.v.), "the land of the Philistines" ( Psalms 60:8 ;  87:4 ;  108:9 ). The word is supposed to mean "the land of wanderers" or "of strangers."  </p>
Philistines	<p>( Genesis 10:14 , RSV; but in A.V., "Philistim"), a tribe allied to the Phoenicians. They were a branch of the primitive race which spread over the whole district of the Lebanon and the valley of the Jordan, and Crete and other Mediterranean islands. Some suppose them to have been a branch of the Rephaim ( 2 Samuel 21:16-22 ). In the time of Abraham they inhabited the south-west of Judea, Abimelech of Gerar being their king ( Genesis 21:32 Genesis 21:34 ;  26:1 ). They are, however, not noticed among the Canaanitish tribes mentioned in the Pentateuch. They are spoken of by ( Amos 9:7 ) and ( Jeremiah 47:4 ) as from Caphtor, i.e., probably Crete, or, as some think, the Delta of Egypt. In the whole record from Exodus to Samuel they are represented as inhabiting the tract of country which lay between Judea and Egypt ( Exodus 13:17 ;  Exodus 15:14 Exodus 15:15 ;  Joshua 13:3 ;  1 Samuel 4 ).  </p><p> This powerful tribe made frequent incursions against the Hebrews. There was almost perpetual war between them. They sometimes held the tribes, especially the southern tribes, in degrading servitude ( Judges 15:11 ;  1 Samuel 13:19-22 ); at other times they were defeated with great slaughter ( 1 Samuel 14:1-47 ;  17 ). These hostilities did not cease till the time of Hezekiah ( 2 Kings 18:8 ), when they were entirely subdued. They still, however, occupied their territory, and always showed their old hatred to Israel ( Ezekiel 25:15-17 ). They were finally conquered by the Romans.  </p><p> The Philistines are called Pulsata or Pulista on the Egyptian monuments; the land of the Philistines (Philistia) being termed Palastu and Pilista in the Assyrian inscriptions. They occupied the five cities of Gaza, Ashkelon, Ashdod, Ekron, and Gath, in the south-western corner of Canaan, which belonged to Egypt up to the closing days of the Nineteenth Dynasty. The occupation took place during the reign of Rameses III. of the Twentieth Dynasty. The Philistines had formed part of the great naval confederacy which attacked Egypt, but were eventually repulsed by that Pharaoh, who, however, could not dislodge them from their settlements in Palestine. As they did not enter Palestine till the time of the Exodus, the use of the name Philistines in  Genesis 26:1  must be proleptic. Indeed the country was properly Gerar, as in ch. 20.  </p><p> They are called Allophyli, "foreigners," in the Septuagint, and in the Books of Samuel they are spoken of as uncircumcised. It would therefore appear that they were not of the Semitic race, though after their establishment in Canaan they adopted the Semitic language of the country. We learn from the Old Testament that they came from Caphtor, usually supposed to be Crete. From Philistia the name of the land of the Philistines came to be extended to the whole of "Palestine." Many scholars identify the Philistines with the Pelethites of  2 Samuel 8:18 .  </p>
Phinehas	<p>mouth of brass, or from old Egypt, the negro. </p><li> Son of Eleazar, the high priest ( Exodus 6:25 ). While yet a youth he distinguished himself at Shittim by his zeal against the immorality into which the Moabites had tempted the people ( Numbers 25:1-9 ), and thus "stayed the plague" that had broken out among the people, and by which twenty-four thousand of them perished. For his faithfulness on that occasion he received the divine approbation (10-13). He afterwards commanded the army that went out against the Midianites ( 31:6-8 ). When representatives of the people were sent to expostulate with the two and a half tribes who, just after crossing Jordan, built an altar and departed without giving any explanation, Phinehas was their leader, and addressed them in the words recorded in  Joshua 22:16-20 . Their explanation follows. This great altar was intended to be all ages only a witness that they still formed a part of Israel. Phinehas was afterwards the chief adviser in the war with the Benjamites. He is commemorated in  Psalms 106:30 Psalms 106:31 . (See ED .) </li><li> One of the sons of Eli, the high priest ( 1 Samuel 1:3 ;  2:12 ). He and his brother Hophni were guilty of great crimes, for which destruction came on the house of Eli (31). He died in battle with the Philistines ( 1 Samuel 4:4 1 Samuel 4:11 ); and his wife, on hearing of his death, gave birth to a son, whom she called "Ichabod," and then she died (19-22).   </li>
Phlegon	<p>burning, a Roman Christian to whom Paul sent salutations ( Romans 16:14 ).  </p>
Phoenicia	<p>( Acts 21:2 ). (See PHENICIA .) </p>
Phrygia	<p>dry, an irregular and ill-defined district in Asia Minor. It was divided into two parts, the Greater Phrygia on the south, and the Lesser Phrygia on the west. It is the Greater Phrygia that is spoken of in the New Testament. The towns of Antioch in Pisidia ( Acts 13:14 ), Colosse, Hierapolis, Iconium, and Laodicea were situated in it.  </p>
Phut	<p>Phut is placed between Egypt and Canaan in  Genesis 10:6 , and elsewhere we find the people of Phut described as mercenaries in the armies of Egypt and Tyre ( Jeremiah 46:9 ;  Ezekiel 30:5 ;  27:10 ). In a fragment of the annuals of Nebuchadrezzar which records his invasion of Egypt, reference is made to "Phut of the Ionians."  </p>
Phygellus	<p>fugitive, a Christian of Asia, who "turned away" from Paul during his second imprisonment at Rome ( 2 Timothy 1:15 ). Nothing more is known of him.  </p>
Phylacteries	<p>(Gr. phulakteria; i.e., "defences" or "protections"), called by modern Jews tephillin (i.e., "prayers") are mentioned only in  Matthew 23:5 . They consisted of strips of parchment on which were inscribed these four texts: </p><li> Exodus 13:1-10 ; </li><li> 11-16; </li><li> Deuteronomy 6:4-9 ;  Deuteronomy 11:18-21 , and which were enclosed in a square leather case, on one side of which was inscribed the Hebrew letter shin, to which the rabbis attached some significance. This case was fastened by certain straps to the forehead just between the eyes. The "making broad the phylacteries" refers to the enlarging of the case so as to make it conspicuous. (See FRONTLETS .) <p> Another form of the phylactery consisted of two rolls of parchment, on which the same texts were written, enclosed in a case of black calfskin. This was worn on the left arm near the elbow, to which it was bound by a thong. It was called the "Tephillah on the arm." </p> </li>
Physician	<p>Asa, afflicted with some bodily malady, "sought not to the Lord but to the physicians" ( 2 Chronicles 16:12 ). The "physicians" were those who "practised heathen arts of magic, disavowing recognized methods of cure, and dissociating the healing art from dependence on the God of Israel. The sin of Asa was not, therefore, in seeking medical advice, as we understand the phrase, but in forgetting Jehovah."  </p>
Pi-beseth	<p>( Ezekiel 30:17 ), supposed to mean. "a cat," or a deity in the form of a cat, worshipped by the Egyptians. It was called by the Greeks Bubastis. The hieroglyphic name is "Pe-bast", i.e., the house of Bast, the Artemis of the Egyptians. The town of Bubasts was situated on the Pelusian branch, i.e., the easternmost branch, of the Delta. It was the seat of one of the chief annual festivals of the Egyptians. Its ruins bear the modern name of Tel-Basta.  </p>
Pieces	<p>(1) of silver. In  Psalms 68:30  denotes "fragments," and not properly money. In  1 Samuel 2:36  (Heb. agorah), properly a "small sum" as wages, weighed rather than coined.  Joshua 24:32  (Heb. kesitah, q.v.), supposed by some to have been a piece of money bearing the figure of a lamb, but rather simply a certain amount. (Compare  Genesis 33:19 ).  </p><li> The word pieces is omitted in many passages, as  Genesis 20:16 ;  37:28 ;  45:22 , etc. The passage in Zech 11:12,13is quoted in the Gospel ( Matthew 26:15 ), and from this we know that the word to be supplied is "shekels." In all these omissions we may thus warrantably supply this word.  </li><li> The "piece of money" mentioned in  Matthew 17:27  is a stater=a Hebrew shekel, or four Greek drachmae; and that in  Luke 15:8 Luke 15:9 , Act  19:19 , a Greek drachma=a denarius. (See PENNY .)  </li>
Piety	<p>Lat. pietas, properly honour and respect toward parents ( 1 Timothy 5:4 ). In  Acts 17:23  the Greek verb is rendered "ye worship," as applicable to God.  </p>
Pigeon	<p>Pigeons are mentioned as among the offerings which, by divine appointment, Abram presented unto the Lord ( Genesis 15:9 ). They were afterwards enumerated among the sin-offerings ( Leviticus 1:14 ;  12:6 ), and the law provided that those who could not offer a lamb might offer two young pigeons ( 5:7 ; Compare  Luke 2:24 ). (See DOVE .) </p>
Pi-hahiroth	<p>place where the reeds grow (LXX. and Copt. read "farmstead"), the name of a place in Egypt where the children of Israel encamped ( Exodus 14:2 Exodus 14:9 ), how long is uncertain. Some have identified it with Ajrud, a fortress between Etham and Suez. The condition of the Isthmus of Suez at the time of the Exodus is not exactly known, and hence this, with the other places mentioned as encampments of Israel in Egypt, cannot be definitely ascertained. The isthmus has been formed by the Nile deposits. This increase of deposit still goes on, and so rapidly that within the last fifty years the mouth of the Nile has advanced northward about four geographical miles. In the maps of Ptolemy (of the second and third centuries A.D.) the mouths of the Nile are forty miles further south than at present. (See EXODUS .) </p>
Pilate, Pontius	<p>probably connected with the Roman family of the Pontii, and called "Pilate" from the Latin pileatus, i.e., "wearing the pileus", which was the "cap or badge of a manumitted slave," as indicating that he was a "freedman," or the descendant of one. He was the sixth in the order of the Roman procurators of Judea (A.D. 26-36). His headquarters were at Caesarea, but he frequently went up to Jerusalem. His reign extended over the period of the ministry of John the Baptist and of Jesus Christ, in connection with whose trial his name comes into prominent notice. Pilate was a "typical Roman, not of the antique, simple stamp, but of the imperial period, a man not without some remains of the ancient Roman justice in his soul, yet pleasure-loving, imperious, and corrupt. He hated the Jews whom he ruled, and in times of irritation freely shed their blood. They returned his hatred with cordiality, and accused him of every crime, maladministration, cruelty, and robbery. He visited Jerusalem as seldom as possible; for, indeed, to one accustomed to the pleasures of Rome, with its theatres, baths, games, and gay society, Jerusalem, with its religiousness and ever-smouldering revolt, was a dreary residence. When he did visit it he stayed in the palace of Herod the Great, it being common for the officers sent by Rome into conquered countries to occupy the palaces of the displaced sovereigns."  </p><p> After his trial before the Sanhedrin, Jesus was brought to the Roman procurator, Pilate, who had come up to Jerusalem as usual to preserve order during the Passover, and was now residing, perhaps, in the castle of Antonia, or it may be in Herod's palace. Pilate came forth from his palace and met the deputation from the Sanhedrin, who, in answer to his inquiry as to the nature of the accusation they had to prefer against Jesus, accused him of being a "malefactor." Pilate was not satisfied with this, and they further accused him (1) of sedition, (2) preventing the payment of the tribute to Caesar, and (3) of assuming the title of king ( Luke 23:2 ). Pilate now withdrew with Jesus into the palace ( John 18:33 ) and examined him in private (37,38); and then going out to the deputation still standing before the gate, he declared that he could find no fault in Jesus ( Luke 23:4 ). This only aroused them to more furious clamour, and they cried that he excited the populace "throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee." When Pilate heard of Galilee, he sent the accused to Herod Antipas, who had jurisdiction over that province, thus hoping to escape the difficulty in which he found himself. But Herod, with his men of war, set Jesus at nought, and sent him back again to Pilate, clad in a purple robe of mockery ( Luke 23:11 Luke 23:12 ).  </p><p> Pilate now proposed that as he and Herod had found no fault in him, they should release Jesus; and anticipating that they would consent to this proposal, he ascended the judgment-seat as if ready to ratify the decision ( Matthew 27:19 ). But at this moment his wife (Claudia Procula) sent a message to him imploring him to have nothing to do with the "just person." Pilate's feelings of perplexity and awe were deepened by this incident, while the crowd vehemently cried out, "Not this man, but Barabbas." Pilate answered, "What then shall I do with Jesus?" The fierce cry immediately followed. "Let him be crucified." Pilate, apparently vexed, and not knowning what to do, said, "Why, what evil hath he done?" but with yet fiercer fanaticism the crowd yelled out, "Away with him! crucify him, crucify him!" Pilate yielded, and sent Jesus away to be scourged. This scourging was usually inflicted by lictors; but as Pilate was only a procurator he had no lictor, and hence his soldiers inflicted this terrible punishment. This done, the soldiers began to deride the sufferer, and they threw around him a purple robe, probably some old cast-off robe of state ( Matthew 27:28 ;  John 19:2 ), and putting a reed in his right hand, and a crowd of thorns on his head, bowed the knee before him in mockery, and saluted him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!" They took also the reed and smote him with it on the head and face, and spat in his face, heaping upon him every indignity.  </p><p> Pilate then led forth Jesus from within the Praetorium ( Matthew 27:27 ) before the people, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, saying, "Behold the man!" But the sight of Jesus, now scourged and crowned and bleeding, only stirred their hatred the more, and again they cried out, "Crucify him, crucify him!" and brought forth this additional charge against him, that he professed to be "the Son of God." Pilate heard this accusation with a superstitious awe, and taking him once more within the Praetorium, asked him, "Whence art thou?" Jesus gave him no answer. Pilate was irritated by his continued silence, and said, "Knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee?" Jesus, with calm dignity, answered the Roman, "Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above."  </p><p> After this Pilate seemed more resolved than ever to let Jesus go. The crowd perceiving this cried out, "If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend." This settled the matter. He was afraid of being accused to the emperor. Calling for water, he washed his hands in the sight of the people, saying, "I am innocent of the blood of this just person." The mob, again scorning his scruples, cried, "His blood be on us, and on our children." Pilate was stung to the heart by their insults, and putting forth Jesus before them, said, "Shall I crucify your King?" The fatal moment had now come. They madly exclaimed, "We have no king but Caesar;" and now Jesus is given up to them, and led away to be crucified. </p><p> By the direction of Pilate an inscription was placed, according to the Roman custom, over the cross, stating the crime for which he was crucified. Having ascertained from the centurion that he was dead, he gave up the body to Joseph of Arimathea to be buried. Pilate's name now disappears from the Gospel history. References to him, however, are found in the Acts of the Apostles ( 3:13 ;  4:27 ;  13:28 ), and in  1 Timothy 6:13 . In A.D. 36 the governor of Syria brought serious accusations against Pilate, and he was banished to Vienne in Gaul, where, according to tradition, he committed suicide.  </p>
Pillar	<p>used to support a building ( Judges 16:26 Judges 16:29 ); as a trophy or memorial ( Genesis 28:18 ;  35:20 ;  Exodus 24:4 ;  1 Samuel 15:12 , A.V., "place," more correctly "monument," or "trophy of victory," as in  2 Samuel 18:18 ); of fire, by which the Divine Presence was manifested ( Exodus 13:2 ). The "plain of the pillar" in  Judges 9:6  ought to be, as in the Revised Version, the "oak of the pillar", i.e., of the monument or stone set up by ( Joshua 24:26 ).  </p>
Pine tree	<p>Heb. tidhar, mentioned along with the fir-tree in  Isaiah 41:19 ;  60:13 . This is probably the cypress; or it may be the stone-pine, which is common on the northern slopes of Lebanon. Some suppose that the elm, others that the oak, or holm, or ilex, is meant by the Hebrew word. In  Nehemiah 8:15  the Revised Version has "wild olive" instead of "pine." (See FIR .) </p>
Pinnacle	<p>a little wing, ( Matthew 4:5 ;  Luke 4:9 ). On the southern side of the temple court was a range of porches or cloisters forming three arcades. At the south-eastern corner the roof of this cloister was some 300 feet above the Kidron valley. The pinnacle, some parapet or wing-like projection, was above this roof, and hence at a great height, probably 350 feet or more above the valley.  </p>
Pipe	<p>( 1 Samuel 10:5 ;  1 Kings 1:40 ;  Isaiah 5:12 ;  30:29 ). The Hebrew word halil, so rendered, means "bored through," and is the name given to various kinds of wind instruments, as the fife, flute, Pan-pipes, etc. In  Amos 6:5  this word is rendered "instrument of music." This instrument is mentioned also in the New Testament ( Matthew 11:17 ;  1 Corinthians 14:7 ). It is still used in Palestine, and is, as in ancient times, made of different materials, as reed, copper, bronze, etc.  </p>
Piram	<p>like a wild ass, a king of Jarmuth, a royal city of the Canaanites, who was conquered and put to death by ( Joshua 10:3 Joshua 10:23 Joshua 10:26 ).  </p>
Pirathon	<p>prince, or summit, a place "in the land of Ephraim" (Judg.  12:15 ), now Fer'on, some 10 miles south-west of Shechem. This was the home of Abdon the judge.  </p>
Pirathonite	<p></p><li> Abdon, the son of Hillel, so called,  Judges 12:13 Judges 12:15 .  </li><li> Benaiah the Ephraimite ( 2 Samuel 23:30 ), one of David's thirty heroes.   </li>
Pisgah	<p>a part, a mountain summit in the land of Moab, in the territory of Reuben, where Balak offered up sacrifices ( Numbers 21:20 ;  23:14 ), and from which Moses viewed the promised land ( Deuteronomy 3:27 ). It is probably the modern Jebel Siaghah. (See NEBO .) </p>
Pisidia	<p>a district in Asia Minor, to the north of Pamphylia. The Taurus range of mountains extends through it. Antioch, one of its chief cities, was twice visited by Paul ( Acts 13:14 ;  14:21-24 ).  </p>
Pison	<p>Babylonian, the current, broad-flowing, one of the "four heads" into which the river which watered the garden of Eden was divided ( Genesis 2:11 ). Some identify it with the modern Phasis, others with the Halys, others the Jorak or Acampis, others the Jaab, the Indus, the Ganges, etc.  </p>
Pit	<p>a hole in the ground ( Exodus 21:33 Exodus 21:34 ), a cistern for water ( Genesis 37:24 ;  Jeremiah 14:3 ), a vault ( 41:9 ), a grave ( Psalms 30:3 ). It is used as a figure for mischief ( Psalms 9:15 ), and is the name given to the unseen place of woe ( Revelation 20:1 Revelation 20:3 ). The slime-pits in the vale of Siddim were wells which yielded asphalt ( Genesis 14:10 ).  </p>
Pitch	<p>( Genesis 6:14 ), asphalt or bitumen in its soft state, called "slime" ( Genesis 11:3 ;  14:10 ;  Exodus 2:3 ), found in pits near the Dead Sea (q.v.). It was used for various purposes, as the coating of the outside of vessels and in building. Allusion is made in  Isaiah 34:9  to its inflammable character. (See SLIME .) </p>
Pitcher	<p>a vessel for containing liquids. In the East pitchers were usually carried on the head or shoulders ( Genesis 24:15-20 ; Judg.  Genesis 7:16 Genesis 7:19 ;  Mark 14:13 ).  </p>
Pithom	<p>Egyptian, Pa-Tum, "house of Tum," the sun-god, one of the "treasure" cities built for Pharaoh Rameses II. by the Israelites ( Exodus 1:11 ). It was probably the Patumos of the Greek historian Herodotus. It has now been satisfactorily identified with Tell-el-Maskhuta, about 12 miles west of Ismailia, and 20 east of Tel-el-Kebir, on the southern bank of the present Suez Canal. Here have recently (1883) been discovered the ruins of supposed grain-chambers, and other evidences to show that this was a great "store city." Its immense ruin-heaps show that it was built of bricks, and partly also of bricks without straw. Succoth ( Exodus 12:37 ) is supposed by some to be the secular name of this city, Pithom being its sacred name. This was the first halting-place of the Israelites in their exodus. It has been argued (Dr. Lansing) that these "store" cities "were residence cities, royal dwellings, such as the Pharaohs of old, the Kings of Israel, and our modern Khedives have ever loved to build, thus giving employment to the superabundant muscle of their enslaved peoples, and making a name for themselves."  </p>
Plague	<p>a "stroke" of affliction, or disease. Sent as a divine chastisement ( Numbers 11:33 ;  14:37 ;  16:46-49 ;  2 Sam  24:21 ). Painful afflictions or diseases, ( Leviticus 13:3 Leviticus 13:5 Leviticus 13:30 ;  1 Kings 8:37 ), or severe calamity ( Mark 5:29 ;  Luke 7:21 ), or the judgment of God, so called ( Exodus 9:14 ). Plagues of Egypt were ten in number.  </p><li> The river Nile was turned into blood, and the fish died, and the river stank, so that the Egyptians loathed to drink of the river ( Exodus 7:14-25 ).  </li><li> The plague of frogs ( Exodus 8:1-15 ).  </li><li> The plague of lice (Heb. kinnim, properly gnats or mosquitoes; Compare  Psalms 78:45 ;  105:31 ), "out of the dust of the land" ( Exodus 8:16-19 ).  </li><li> The plague of flies (Heb. arob, rendered by the LXX. dog-fly),  Exodus 8:21-24 .  </li><li> The murrain (Ex.9:1-7), or epidemic pestilence which carried off vast numbers of cattle in the field. Warning was given of its coming.  </li><li> The sixth plague, of "boils and blains," like the third, was sent without warning (Ex.9:8-12). It is called ( Deuteronomy 28:27 ) "the botch of Egypt," A.V.; but in RSV, "the boil of Egypt." "The magicians could not stand before Moses" because of it.  </li><li> The plague of hail, with fire and thunder ( Exodus 9:13-33 ). Warning was given of its coming. (Compare  Psalms 18:13 ;  Psalms 105:32 Psalms 105:33 ).  </li><li> The plague of locusts, which covered the whole face of the earth, so that the land was darkened with them ( Exodus 10:12-15 ). The Hebrew name of this insect, <i> arbeh</i> , points to the "multitudinous" character of this visitation. Warning was given before this plague came. </li><li> After a short interval the plague of darkness succeeded that of the locusts; and it came without any special warning ( Exodus 10:21-29 ). The darkness covered "all the land of Egypt" to such an extent that "they saw not one another." It did not, however, extend to the land of Goshen.  </li><li> The last and most fearful of these plagues was the death of the first-born of man and of beast ( Exodus 11:4 Exodus 11:5 ;  Exodus 12:29 Exodus 12:30 ). The exact time of the visitation was announced, "about midnight", which would add to the horror of the infliction. Its extent also is specified, from the first-born of the king to the first-born of the humblest slave, and all the first-born of beasts. But from this plague the Hebrews were completely exempted. The Lord "put a difference" between them and the Egyptians. (See PASSOVER .)  </li>
Plain	<p></p><li> Heb. 'abel ( Judges 11:33 ), a "grassy plain" or "meadow." Instead of "plains of the vineyards," as in the Authorized Version, the Revised Version has "Abel-cheramim" (q.v.), Compare  Judges 11:22 ;  2 Chr  16:4 .  </li><li> Heb. 'elon ( Genesis 12:6 ;  13:18 ;  14:13 ;  18:1 ;  Deuteronomy 11:30 ;  Judges 9:6 ), more correctly "oak," as in the Revised Version; margin, "terebinth."  </li><li> Heb. bik'ah ( Genesis 11:2 ;  Nehemiah 6:2 ;  Ezekiel 3:23 ;  Daniel 3:1 ), properly a valley, as rendered in  Isaiah 40:4 , a broad plain between mountains. In  Amos 1:5  the margin of Authorized Version has "Bikathaven."  </li><li> Heb. kikar, "the circle," used only of the Ghor, or the low ground along the Jordan ( Genesis 13:10-12 ;  Genesis 19:17 Genesis 19:25 Genesis 19:28 Genesis 19:29 ;  Deuteronomy 34:3 ;  2 Sam  <span class="badLink">18:23</span> ;  1 Kings 7:46 ;  2 Chr  4:17 ;  Nehemiah 3:22 ;  12:28 ), the floor of the valley through which it flows. This name is applied to the Jordan valley as far north as Succoth.  </li><li> Heb. mishor, "level ground," smooth, grassy table-land ( Deuteronomy 3:10 ;  4:43 ;  Joshua 13:9 Joshua 13:16 Joshua 13:17 Joshua 13:21 ;  20:8 ;  Jeremiah 48:21 ), an expanse of rolling downs without rock or stone. In these passages, with the article prefixed, it denotes the plain in the tribe of Reuben. In  2 Chronicles 26:10  the plain of Judah is meant. Jerusalem is called "the rock of the plain" in  Jeremiah 21:13 , because the hills on which it is built rise high above the plain.  </li><li> Heb. 'arabah, the valley from the Sea of Galilee southward to the Dead Sea (the "sea of the plain,"  2 Kings 14:25 ;  Deuteronomy 1:1 ;  2:8 ), a distance of about 70 miles. It is called by the modern Arabs the Ghor. This Hebrew name is found in Authorized Version ( Joshua 18:18 ), and is uniformly used in the Revised Version. Down through the centre of this plain is a ravine, from 200 to 300 yards wide, and from 50 to 100 feet deep, through which the Jordan flows in a winding course. This ravine is called the "lower plain."  <p> The name Arabah is also applied to the whole Jordan valley from Mount Hermon to the eastern branch of the Red Sea, a distance of about 200 miles, as well as to that portion of the valley which stretches from the Sea of Galilee to the same branch of the Red Sea, i.e., to the Gulf of Akabah about 100 miles in all.  </p></li><li> Heb. shephelah, "low ground," "low hill-land," rendered "vale" or "valley" in Authorized Version ( Joshua 9:1 ;  10:40 ;  11:2 ;  12:8 ;  Judges 1:9 ;  1 Kings 10:27 ). In Authorized Version ( 1 Chronicles 27:28 ;  2 Chr  26:10 ) it is also rendered "low country." In  Jeremiah 17:26 ,  Obadiah 1:19 ,  Zechariah 7:7 , "plain." The Revised Version renders it uniformly "low land." When it is preceded by the article, as in  Deuteronomy 1:7 ,  Joshua 11:16 ;  15:33 ,  Jeremiah 32:44 ;  33:13 ,  Zechariah 7:7 , "the shephelah," it denotes the plain along the Mediterranean from Joppa to Gaza, "the plain of the Philistines." (See VALLEY .)  </li>
Plain of Mamre	<p>( Genesis 13:18 ;  14:13 ; RSV, "oaks of Mamre;" marg., "terebinths"). (See MAMRE; TEIL-TREE.)  </p>
Plane tree	<p>Heb. 'armon ( Genesis 30:37 ;  Ezekiel 31:8 ), rendered "chesnut" in the Authorized Version, but correctly "plane tree" in the Revised Version and the LXX. This tree is frequently found in Palestine, both on the coast and in the north. It usually sheds its outer bark, and hence its Hebrew name, which means "naked." (See CHESTNUT .) </p>
Pledge	<p>See LOAN . </p>
Pleiades	<p>Heb. kimah, "a cluster" ( Job 9:9 ;  38:31 ;  Amos 5:8 , A.V., "seven stars;" RSV, "Pleiades"), a name given to the cluster of stars seen in the shoulder of the constellation Taurus.  </p>
Plough	<p>first referred to in  Genesis 45:6 , where the Authorized Version has "earing," but the Revised Version "ploughing;" next in  Exodus 34:21  and  Deuteronomy 21:4 . The plough was originally drawn by oxen, but sometimes also by asses and by men. (See AGRICULTURE .) </p>
Poetry	<p>has been well defined as "the measured language of emotion." Hebrew poetry deals almost exclusively with the great question of man's relation to God. "Guilt, condemnation, punishment, pardon, redemption, repentance are the awful themes of this heaven-born poetry." </p><p> In the Hebrew scriptures there are found three distinct kinds of poetry, (1) that of the Book of Job and the Song of Solomon, which is dramatic; (2) that of the Book of Psalms, which is lyrical; and (3) that of the Book of Ecclesiastes, which is didactic and sententious.  </p><p> Hebrew poetry has nothing akin to that of Western nations. It has neither metre nor rhyme. Its great peculiarity consists in the mutual correspondence of sentences or clauses, called parallelism, or "thought-rhyme." Various kinds of this parallelism have been pointed out: </p><li> Synonymous or cognate parallelism, where the same idea is repeated in the same words ( Psalms 93:3 ;  94:1 ;  Proverbs 6:2 ), or in different words ( Psalms 222328114 ,23,28,114, etc.); or where it is expressed in a positive form in the one clause and in a negative in the other ( Psalms 40:12 ;  Proverbs 6:26 ); or where the same idea is expressed in three successive clauses ( Psalms 40:15 Psalms 40:16 ); or in a double parallelism, the first and second clauses corresponding to the third and fourth ( Isaiah 9:1 ;  Isaiah 61:10 Isaiah 61:11 ).  </li><li> Antithetic parallelism, where the idea of the second clause is the converse of that of the first ( Psalms 20:8 ;  Psalms 27:6 Psalms 27:7 ;  34:11 ;  Psalms 37:9 Psalms 37:17 Psalms 37:21 Psalms 37:22 ). This is the common form of gnomic or proverbial poetry. (See   Proverbs 1015 -15.)  </li><li> Synthetic or constructive or compound parallelism, where each clause or sentence contains some accessory idea enforcing the main idea ( Psalms 19:7-10 ;  85:12 ;  Job 3:3-9 ;  Isaiah 1:5-9 ).  </li><li> Introverted parallelism, in which of four clauses the first answers to the fourth and the second to the third ( Psalms 135:15-18 ;  Proverbs 23:15 Proverbs 23:16 ), or where the second line reverses the order of words in the first ( Psalms 86:2 ).  <p> Hebrew poetry sometimes assumes other forms than these. </p></li><li> An alphabetical arrangement is sometimes adopted for the purpose of connecting clauses or sentences. Thus in the following the initial words of the respective verses begin with the letters of the alphabet in regular succession:  Proverbs 31:10-31 ; Lam. 1,2,3,4;  Psalms 253437145 ,34,37,145.  Psalms 119  has a letter of the alphabet in regular order beginning every eighth verse.  </li><li> The repetition of the same verse or of some emphatic expression at intervals ( Psalms 42107 ,107, where the refrain is in verses, 8,15,21,31). (Compare also  Isaiah 9:8-10:4; ;  Amos 1:3 Amos 1:6 Amos 1:9 Amos 1:11 Amos 1:13 ;  Amos 2:1 Amos 2:4 Amos 2:6 .)  </li><li> Gradation, in which the thought of one verse is resumed in another ( Psalms 121 ).  <p> Several odes of great poetical beauty are found in the historical books of the Old Testament, such as the song of Moses ( Exodus 15 ), the song of Deborah (Judg. 5), of Hannah ( 1 Samuel 2 ), of Hezekiah ( Isaiah 38:9-20 ), of Habakkuk ( Habakkuk 3 ), and David's "song of the bow" ( 2 Samuel 1:19-27 ).  </p> </li>
Poison	<p></p><li> Heb. hemah, "heat," the poison of certain venomous reptiles ( Deuteronomy 32:24 Deuteronomy 32:33 ;  Job 6:4 ;  Psalms 58:4 ), causing inflammation.  </li><li> Heb. rosh, "a head," a poisonous plant ( Deuteronomy 29:18 ), growing luxuriantly ( Hosea 10:4 ), of a bitter taste ( Psalms 69:21 ;  Lamentations 3:5 ), and coupled with wormwood; probably the poppy. This word is rendered "gall", q.v., ( Deuteronomy 29:18 ;  32:33 ;  Psalms 69:21 ;  Jeremiah 8:14 , etc.), "hemlock" ( Hosea 10:4 ;  Amos 6:12 ), and "poison" ( Job 20:16 ), "the poison of asps," showing that the <i> rosh</i> was not exclusively a vegetable poison. </li><li> In  Romans 3:13  (Compare  Job 20:16 ;  Psalms 140:3 ),  James 3:8 , as the rendering of the Greek ios.   </li>
Pomegranate	<p>i.e., "grained apple" (pomum granatum), Heb. rimmon. Common in Egypt ( Numbers 20:5 ) and Palestine ( 13:23 ;  Deuteronomy 8:8 ). The Romans called it Punicum malum, i.e., Carthaginian apple, because they received it from Carthage. It belongs to the myrtle family of trees. The withering of the pomegranate tree is mentioned among the judgments of God ( Joel 1:12 ). It is frequently mentioned in the Song of Solomon (Cant  Joel 4:3  Joel 4:13 , etc.). The skirt of the high priest's blue robe and ephod was adorned with the representation of pomegranates, alternating with golden bells ( Exodus 28:33 Exodus 28:34 ), as also were the "chapiters upon the two pillars" ( 1 Kings 7:20 ) which "stood before the house."  </p>
Pommels	<p>( 2 Chronicles 4:12 2 Chronicles 4:13 ), or bowls ( 1 Kings 7:41 ), were balls or "rounded knobs" on the top of the chapiters (q.v.).  </p>
Pontius Pilate	<p>See PILATE . </p>
Pontus	<p>a province of Asia Minor, stretching along the southern coast of the Euxine Sea, corresponding nearly to the modern province of Trebizond. In the time of the apostles it was a Roman province. Strangers from this province were at Jerusalem at Pentecost ( Acts 2:9 ), and to "strangers scattered throughout Pontus," among others, Peter addresses his first epistle ( 1 Peter 1:1 ). It was evidently the resort of many Jews of the Dispersion. Aquila was a native of Pontus ( Acts 18:2 ).  </p>
Pool	<p>a pond, or reservoir, for holding water (Heb. berekhah; modern Arabic, birket), an artificial cistern or tank. Mention is made of the pool of Gibeon ( 2 Samuel 2:13 ); the pool of Hebron ( 4:12 ); the upper pool at Jerusalem ( 2 Kings 18:17 ;  20:20 ); the pool of Samaria ( 1 Kings 22:38 ); the king's pool ( Nehemiah 2:14 ); the pool of Siloah ( Nehemiah 3:15 ;  Ecclesiastes 2:6 ); the fishpools of Heshbon (Cant  7:4 ); the "lower pool," and the "old pool" ( Isaiah 22:9 Isaiah 22:11 ).  </p><p> The "pool of Bethesda" ( John 5:2  John 5:4  John 5:7 ) and the "pool of Siloam" ( John 9:7 John 9:11 ) are also mentioned. ( Isaiah 35:7 ) says, "The parched ground shall become a pool." This is rendered in the Revised Version "glowing sand," etc. (marg., "the mirage," etc.). The Arabs call the mirage "serab," plainly the same as the Hebrew word <i> sarab</i> , here rendered "parched ground." "The mirage shall become a pool", i.e., the mock-lake of the burning desert shall become a real lake, "the pledge of refreshment and joy." The "pools" spoken of in  Isaiah 14:23  are the marshes caused by the ruin of the canals of the Euphrates in the neighbourhood of Babylon.  </p><p> The cisterns or pools of the Holy City are for the most part excavations beneath the surface. Such are the vast cisterns in the temple hill that have recently been discovered by the engineers of the Palestine Exploration Fund. These underground caverns are about thirty-five in number, and are capable of storing about ten million gallons of water. They are connected with one another by passages and tunnels. </p>
Pools of Solomon	<p>the name given to three large open cisterns at Etam, at the head of the Wady Urtas, having an average length of 400 feet by 220 in breadth, and 20 to 30 in depth. These pools derive their chief supply of water from a spring called "the sealed fountain," about 200 yards to the north-west of the upper pool, to which it is conveyed by a large subterranean passage. They are 150 feet distant from each other, and each pool is 20 feet lower than that above it, the conduits being so arranged that the lowest, which is the largest and finest of the three, is filled first, and then in succession the others. It has been estimated that these pools cover in all a space of about 7 acres, and are capable of containing three million gallons of water. They were, as is generally supposed, constructed in the days of Solomon. They are probably referred to in  Ecclesiastes 2:6 . On the fourth day after his victory over the Ammonites, etc., in the wilderness of Tekoa, Jehoshaphat assembled his army in the valley of Berachah ("blessing"), and there blessed the Lord. Berachah has been identified with the modern Bereikut, some 5 miles south of Wady Urtas, and hence the "valley of Berachah" may be this valley of pools, for the word means both "blessing" and "pools;" and it has been supposed, therefore, that this victory was celebrated beside Solomon's pools ( 2 Chronicles 20:26 ).  </p><p> These pools were primarily designed to supply Jerusalem with water. From the lower pool an aqueduct has been traced conveying the water through Bethlehem and across the valley of Gihon, and along the west slope of the Tyropoeon valley, till it finds its way into the great cisterns underneath the temple hill. The water, however, from the pools reaches now only to Bethlehem. The aqueduct beyond this has been destroyed. </p>
Poor	<p>The Mosaic legislation regarding the poor is specially important. </p><li> They had the right of gleaning the fields ( Leviticus 19:9 Leviticus 19:10 ;  Deuteronomy 24:19 Deuteronomy 24:21 ).  </li><li> In the sabbatical year they were to have their share of the produce of the fields and the vineyards ( Exodus 23:11 ;  Leviticus 25:6 ).  </li><li> In the year of jubilee they recovered their property ( Leviticus 25:25-30 ).  </li><li> Usury was forbidden, and the pledged raiment was to be returned before the sun went down ( Exodus 22:25-27 ;  Deuteronomy 24:10-13 ). The rich were to be generous to the poor ( Deuteronomy 15:7-11 ).  </li><li> In the sabbatical and jubilee years the bond-servant was to go free ( Deuteronomy 15:12-15 ;  Leviticus 25:39-42 Leviticus 25:47-54 ).  </li><li> Certain portions from the tithes were assigned to the poor ( Deuteronomy 14:28 Deuteronomy 14:29 ;  Deuteronomy 26:12 Deuteronomy 26:13 ).  </li><li> They shared in the feasts ( Deuteronomy 16:11 Deuteronomy 16:14 ;  Nehemiah 8:10 ).  </li><li> Wages were to be paid at the close of each day ( Leviticus 19:13 ).  <p> In the New Testament ( Luke 3:11 ;  14:13 ;  Acts 6:1 ;  Galatians 2:10 ;  James 2:15 James 2:16 ) we have similar injunctions given with reference to the poor. Begging was not common under the Old Testament, while it was so in the New Testament times ( Luke 16:20 Luke 16:21 , etc.). But begging in the case of those who are able to work is forbidden, and all such are enjoined to "work with their own hands" as a Christian duty ( 1 Thessalonians 4:11 ;  2 th  3:7-13 ;  Ephesians 4:28 ). This word is used figuratively in  Matthew 5:3 ;  Luke 6:20 ;  2 co  8:9 ;  Revelation 3:17 .  </p> </li>
Poplar	<p>Heb. libneh, "white", ( Genesis 30:37 ;  Hosea 4:13 ), in all probability the storax tree (Styrax officinalis) or white poplar, distinguished by its white blossoms and pale leaves. It is common in the Anti-Libanus. Other species of the poplar are found in Palestine, such as the white poplar (P. alba) of our own country, the black poplar (P. nigra), and the aspen (P. tremula). (See WILLOW .) </p>
Porch, Solomons	<p>a colonnade on the east of the temple, so called from a tradition that it was a relic of Solomon's temple left standing after the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians. (Compare  1 Kings 7:6 .) The word "porch" is in the New Testament the rendering of three different Greek words:  </p><li> Stoa, meaning a portico or veranda ( John 5:2 ;  10:23 ;  Acts 3:11 ;  5:12 ).  </li><li> Pulon, a gateway ( Matthew 26:71 ).  </li><li> Proaulion, the entrance to the inner court ( Mark 14:68 ).   </li>
Porcius Festus	<p>See FESTUS . </p>
Porter	<p>a gate-keeper ( 2 Samuel 18:26 ;  2 Kings  7:10 ;  1 Chronicles 9:21 ;  2 Chr.  8:14 ). Of the Levites, 4,000 were appointed as porters by David ( 1 Chronicles 23:5 ), who were arranged according to their families ( 26:1-19 ) to take charge of the doors and gates of the temple. They were sometimes employed as musicians ( 1 Chronicles 15:18 ).  </p>
Post	<p></p><li> A runner, or courier, for the rapid transmission of letters, etc. ( 2 Chronicles 30:6 ;  Esther 3:13 Esther 3:15 ;  Esther 8:10 Esther 8:14 ;  Job 9:25 ;  Jeremiah 51:31 ). Such messengers were used from very early times. Those employed by the Hebrew kings had a military character ( 1 Samuel 22:17 ;  2 Kings  10:25 , "guard," marg. "runners"). The modern system of postal communication was first established by Louis XI. of France in A.D. 1464.  </li><li> This word sometimes also is used for lintel or threshold ( Isaiah 6:4 ).   </li>
Potiphar	<p>dedicated to Ra; i.e., to the sun-god, the Egyptian to whom the Ishmaelites sold Joseph ( Genesis 39:1 ). He was "captain of the guard", i.e., chief, probably, of the state police, who, while they formed part of the Egyptian army, were also largely employed in civil duties ( 37:36 ; marg., "chief of the executioners"). Joseph, though a foreigner, gradually gained his confidence, and became overseer over all his possessions. Believing the false accusation which his profligate wife brought against Joseph, Potiphar cast him into prison, where he remained for some years. (See JOSEPH .) </p>
Potipherah	<p>a priest of On, whose daughter Asenath became Joseph's wife ( Genesis 41:45 ).  </p>
Potsherd	<p>a "shred", i.e., anything severed, as a fragment of earthenware ( Job 2:8 ;  Proverbs 26:23 ;  Isaiah 45:9 ).  </p>
Pottage	<p>Heb. nazid, "boiled", a dish of boiled food, as of lentils ( Genesis 25:29 ;  2 Kings  4:38 ).  </p>
Potters field	<p>the name given to the piece of ground which was afterwards bought with the money that had been given to Judas. It was called the "field of blood" ( Matthew 27:7-10 ). Tradition places it in the valley of Hinnom. (See ACELDAMA .) </p>
Pottery	<p>the art of, was early practised among all nations. Various materials seem to have been employed by the potter. Earthenware is mentioned in connection with the history of Melchizedek ( Genesis 14:18 ), of Abraham ( 18:4-8 ), of Rebekah ( 27:14 ), of Rachel ( Genesis 29:2 Genesis 29:3 Genesis 29:8 Genesis 29:10 ). The potter's wheel is mentioned by ( Jeremiah 18:3 ). See also  1 Chronicles 4:23 ;  Psalms 2:9 ;  Isaiah 45:9 ;  64:8 ;  Jeremiah 19:1 ;  Lamentations 4:2 ;  Zechariah 11:13 ;  Romans 9:21 .  </p>
Pound	<p></p><li> A weight. Heb. maneh, equal to 100 shekels ( 1 Kings 10:17 ;  Ezra 2:69 ;  Nehemiah 7:71 Nehemiah 7:72 ). Gr. litra, equal to about 12 oz. avoirdupois ( John 12:3 ;  19:39 ).  </li><li> A sum of money; the Gr. mna or mina ( Luke 19:13 Luke 19:16 Luke 19:18 Luke 19:20 Luke 19:24 Luke 19:25 ). It was equal to 100 drachmas, and was of the value of about $3,6s. 8d. of our money. (See MONEY .)  </li>
Praetorium	<p>The Greek word (praitorion) thus rendered in  Mark 15:16  is rendered "common hall" ( Matthew 27:27 , marg., "governor's house"), "judgment hall," ( John 18:28 John 18:33 , marg., "Pilate's house",  19:9 ;  Acts 23:35 ), "palace" (Phil  1:13 ). This is properly a military word. It denotes (1) the general's tent or headquarters; (2) the governor's residence, as in  Acts 23:35  (RSV, "palace"); and (3) the praetorian guard (See PALACE), or the camp or quarters of the praetorian cohorts ( Acts 28:16 ), the imperial guards in immediate attendance on the emperor, who was "praetor" or commander-in-chief.  </p>
Prayer	<p>is converse with God; the intercourse of the soul with God, not in contemplation or meditation, but in direct address to him. Prayer may be oral or mental, occasional or constant, ejaculatory or formal. It is a "beseeching the Lord" ( Exodus 32:11 ); "pouring out the soul before the Lord" ( 1 Samuel 1:15 ); "praying and crying to heaven" ( 2 Chronicles 32:20 ); "seeking unto God and making supplication" ( Job 8:5 ); "drawing near to God" ( Psalms 73:28 ); "bowing the knees" ( Ephesians 3:14 ).  </p><p> Prayer presupposes a belief in the personality of God, his ability and willingness to hold intercourse with us, his personal control of all things and of all his creatures and all their actions. </p><p> Acceptable prayer must be sincere ( Hebrews 10:22 ), offered with reverence and godly fear, with a humble sense of our own insignificance as creatures and of our own unworthiness as sinners, with earnest importunity, and with unhesitating submission to the divine will. Prayer must also be offered in the faith that God is, and is the hearer and answerer of prayer, and that he will fulfil his word, "Ask, and ye shall receive" ( Matthew 7:7 Matthew 7:8 ;  21:22 ;  Mark 11:24 ;  John 14:13 John 14:14 ), and in the name of Christ ( John 16:23 John 16:24 ;  15:16 ;  Ephesians 2:18 ;  5:20 ;  Colossians 3:17 ;  1 Peter 2:5 ).  </p><p> Prayer is of different kinds, secret ( Matthew 6:6 ); social, as family prayers, and in social worship; and public, in the service of the sanctuary.  </p><p> Intercessory prayer is enjoined ( Numbers 6:23 ;  Job 42:8 ;  Isaiah 62:6 ;  Psalms 122:6 ;  1 Timothy 2:1 ;  James 5:14 ), and there are many instances on record of answers having been given to such prayers, e.g., of Abraham ( Genesis 17:18 Genesis 17:20 ;  18:23-32 ;  Genesis 20:7 Genesis 20:17 Genesis 20:18 ), of Moses for Pharaoh ( Exodus 8:12 Exodus 8:13 Exodus 8:30 Exodus 8:31 ;  Exodus 9:33 ), for the Israelites ( Exodus 17:11 Exodus 17:13 ;  Exodus 32:11-14 Exodus 32:31-34 ;  Numbers 21:7 Numbers 21:8 ;  Deuteronomy 9:18 Deuteronomy 9:19 Deuteronomy 9:25 ), for Miriam ( Numbers 12:13 ), for Aaron ( Deuteronomy 9:20 ), of Samuel ( 1 Samuel 7:5-12 ), of Solomon ( 1 Kings 8 ;  2 Chr.  6 ), Elijah ( 1 Kings 17:20-23 ), Elisha ( 2 Kings 4:33-36 ), Isaiah ( 2 Kings 19 ), ( Jeremiah 42:2-10 ), Peter ( Acts 9:40 ), the church ( 12:5-12 ), Paul ( 28:8 ).  </p><p> No rules are anywhere in Scripture laid down for the manner of prayer or the attitude to be assumed by the suppliant. There is mention made of kneeling in prayer ( 1 Kings 8:54 ;  2 Chronicles 6:13 ;  Psalms 95:6 ;  Isaiah 45:23 ;  Luke 22:41 ;  Acts 7:60 ;  9:40 ;  Ephesians 3:14 , etc.); of bowing and falling prostrate ( Genesis 24:26 Genesis 24:52 ;  Exodus 4:31 ;  12:27 ;  Matthew 26:39 ;  Mark 14:35 , etc.); of spreading out the hands ( 1 Kings 8:22 1 Kings 8:38 1 Kings 8:54 ;  Psalms 28:2 ;  63:4 ;  88:9 ;  1 Timothy 2:8 , etc.); and of standing ( 1 Samuel 1:26 ;  1 Kings 8:14 1 Kings 8:55 ;  2 Chr  20:9 ;  Mark 11:25 ;  Luke 18:11 Luke 18:13 ).  </p><p> If we except the "Lord's Prayer" ( Matthew 6:9-13 ), which is, however, rather a model or pattern of prayer than a set prayer to be offered up, we have no special form of prayer for general use given us in Scripture.  </p><p> Prayer is frequently enjoined in Scripture ( Exodus 22:23 Exodus 22:27 ;  1 Kings 3:5 ;  2 Chr  7:14 ;  Psalms 37:4 ;  Isaiah 55:6 ;  Joel 2:32 ; Ezek.  36:37 , etc.), and we have very many testimonies that it has been answered ( Psalms 3:4 ;  4:1 ;  6:8 ;  18:6 ;  28:6 ;  30:2 ;  34:4 ;  118:5 ;  James 5:16-18 , etc.).  </p><p> "Abraham's servant prayed to God, and God directed him to the person who should be wife to his master's son and heir ( Genesis 24:10-20 ).  </p><p> "Jacob prayed to God, and God inclined the heart of his irritated brother, so that they met in peace and friendship ( Genesis 32:24-30 ;  33:1-4 ).  </p><p> "Samson prayed to God, and God showed him a well where he quenched his burning thirst, and so lived to judge Israel (Judg.  15:18-20 ).  </p><p> "David prayed, and God defeated the counsel of Ahithophel ( 2 Samuel 15:31 ;  16:20-23 ;  17:14-23 ).  </p><p> "Daniel prayed, and God enabled him both to tell Nebuchadnezzar his dream and to give the interpretation of it ( Daniel 2: :  1623 -23).  </p><p> "Nehemiah prayed, and God inclined the heart of the king of Persia to grant him leave of absence to visit and rebuild Jerusalem ( Nehemiah 1:11 ;  2:1-6 ).  </p><p> "Esther and Mordecai prayed, and God defeated the purpose of Haman, and saved the Jews from destruction ( Esther 4:15-17 ;  Esther 6:7 Esther 6:8 ).  </p><p> "The believers in Jerusalem prayed, and God opened the prison doors and set Peter at liberty, when Herod had resolved upon his death ( Acts 12:1-12 ).  </p><p> "Paul prayed that the thorn in the flesh might be removed, and his prayer brought a large increase of spiritual strength, while the thorn perhaps remained ( 2 Corinthians 12:7-10 ).  </p><p> "Prayer is like the dove that Noah sent forth, which blessed him not only when it returned with an olive-leaf in its mouth, but when it never returned at all.", Robinson's Job. </p>
Predestination	<p>This word is properly used only with reference to God's plan or purpose of salvation. The Greek word rendered "predestinate" is found only in these six passages,  Acts 4:28 ;  Romans 8:29 Romans 8:30 ;  1 Corinthians 2:7 ;  Ephesians 1:5 Ephesians 1:11 ; and in all of them it has the same meaning. They teach that the eternal, sovereign, immutable, and unconditional decree or "determinate purpose" of God governs all events.  </p><p> This doctrine of predestination or election is beset with many difficulties. It belongs to the "secret things" of God. But if we take the revealed word of God as our guide, we must accept this doctrine with all its mysteriousness, and settle all our questionings in the humble, devout acknowledgment, "Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight." </p><p> For the teaching of Scripture on this subject let the following passages be examined in addition to those referred to above;  Genesis 21:12 ;  Exodus 9:16 ;  33:19 ;  Deuteronomy 10:15 ;  32:8 ;  Joshua 11:20 ;  1 Samuel 12:22 ;  2 Chr  6:6 ;  Psalms 33:12 ;  65:4 ;  78:68 ;  135:4 ;  Isaiah 41:1-10 ;  Jeremiah 1:5 ;  Mark 13:20 ;  Luke 22:22 ;  John 6:37 ;  15:16 ;  John 17:2 John 17:6 John 17:9 ;  Acts 2:28 ;  3:18 ;  4:28 ;  13:48 ;  17:26 ;  Romans 9:11 Romans 9:18 Romans 9:21 ;  11:5 ;  Ephesians 3:11 ;  1 Thessalonians 1:4 ;  2 th  2:13 ;  2 Tim  1:9 ;  Titus 1:2 ;  1 Peter 1:2 . (See DECREES OF GOD;  ELECTION .) </p><p> Hodge has well remarked that, "rightly understood, this doctrine (1) exalts the majesty and absolute sovereignty of God, while it illustrates the riches of his free grace and his just displeasure with sin. </p><li> It enforces upon us the essential truth that salvation is entirely of grace. That no one can either complain if passed over, or boast himself if saved. </li><li> It brings the inquirer to absolute self-despair and the cordial embrace of the free offer of Christ. </li><li> In the case of the believer who has the witness in himself, this doctrine at once deepens his humility and elevates his confidence to the full assurance of hope" (Outlines).   </li>
Presidents	<p>Three presidents are mentioned, of whom Daniel was the first ( Daniel 6:2-7 ). The name in the original is <i> sarkhin</i> , probably a Persian word meaning perfects or ministers. </p>
Priest	<p>The Heb. kohen, Gr. hierus, Lat. sacerdos, always denote one who offers sacrifices. </p><p> At first every man was his own priest, and presented his own sacrifices before God. Afterwards that office devolved on the head of the family, as in the cases of Noah ( Genesis 8:20 ), Abraham ( 12:7 ;  13:4 ), Isaac ( 26:25 ), Jacob ( 31:54 ), and Job ( Job 1:5 ).  </p><p> The name first occurs as applied to Melchizedek ( Genesis 14:18 ). Under the Levitical arrangements the office of the priesthood was limited to the tribe of Levi, and to only one family of that tribe, the family of Aaron. Certain laws respecting the qualifications of priests are given in  Leviticus 21:16-23 . There are ordinances also regarding the priests' dress ( Exodus 28:40-43 ) and the manner of their consecration to the office ( 29:1-37 ).  </p><p> Their duties were manifold ( Exodus 27:20 Exodus 27:21 ;  29:38-44 ;  Leviticus 6:12 ;  10:11 ;  24:8 ;  Numbers 10:1-10 ;  Deuteronomy 17:8-13 ;  33:10 ;  Malachi 2:7 ). They represented the people before God, and offered the various sacrifices prescribed in the law.  </p><p> In the time of David the priests were divided into twenty-four courses or classes ( 1 Chronicles 24:7-18 ). This number was retained after the Captivity ( Ezra 2:36-39 ;  Nehemiah 7:39-42 ).  </p><p> "The priests were not distributed over the country, but lived together in certain cities [forty-eight in number, of which six were cities of refuge, q.v.], which had been assigned to their use. From thence they went up by turns to minister in the temple at Jerusalem. Thus the religious instruction of the people in the country generally was left to the heads of families, until the establishment of synagogues, an event which did not take place till the return from the Captivity, and which was the main source of the freedom from idolatry that became as marked a feature of the Jewish people thenceforward as its practice had been hitherto their great national sin." </p><p> The whole priestly system of the Jews was typical. It was a shadow of which the body is Christ. The priests all prefigured the great Priest who offered "one sacrifice for sins" "once for all" ( Hebrews 10:10 Hebrews 10:12 ). There is now no human priesthood. (See Epistle to the Hebrews throughout.) The term "priest" is indeed applied to believers ( 1 Peter 2:9 ;  Revelation 1:6 ), but in these cases it implies no sacerdotal functions. All true believers are now "kings and priests unto God." As priests they have free access into the holiest of all, and offer up the sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving, and the sacrifices of grateful service from day to day.  </p>
Prince	<p>the title generally applied to the chief men of the state. The "princes of the provinces" ( 1 Kings 20:14 ) were the governors or lord-lieutenants of the provinces. So also the "princes" mentioned in Dan 6:1,3,4,6,7were the officers who administered the affairs of the provinces; the "satraps" (as rendered in RSV). These are also called "lieutenants" ( Esther 3:12 ;  8:9 ; RSV, "satraps"). The promised Saviour is called by ( Daniel 9:25 ) "Messiah the Prince" (Heb. nagid); compare  Acts 3:15 ;  5:31 . The angel Micheal is called ( Daniel 12:1 ) a "prince" (Heb. sar, whence "Sarah," the "princes").  </p>
Priscilla	<p>the wife of Aquila ( Acts 18:2 ), who is never mentioned without her. Her name sometimes takes the precedence of his ( Romans 16:3 ;  2 Tim  4:19 ). She took part with Aquila (q.v.) in insturcting Apollos ( Acts 18:26 ).  </p>
Prison	<p>The first occasion on which we read of a prison is in the history of Joseph in Egypt. Then Potiphar, "Joseph's master, took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound" ( Genesis 39:20-23 ). The Heb. word here used (sohar) means properly a round tower or fortress. It seems to have been a part of Potiphar's house, a place in which state prisoners were kept.  </p><p> The Mosaic law made no provision for imprisonment as a punishment. In the wilderness two persons were "put in ward" ( Leviticus 24:12 ;  Numbers 15:34 ), but it was only till the mind of God concerning them should be ascertained. Prisons and prisoners are mentioned in the book of ( Psalms 69:33 ;  79:11 ;  142:7 ). Samson was confined in a Philistine prison ( Judges 16:21 Judges 16:25 ). In the subsequent history of Israel frequent references are made to prisons ( 1 Kings 22:27 ;  2 Kings  17:4 ;  1 Kings 25:27  1 Kings 25:29 ;  2 Chr  16:10 ;  Isaiah 42:7 ;  Jeremiah 32:2 ). Prisons seem to have been common in New Testament times ( Matthew 11:2 ;  Matthew 25:36 Matthew 25:43 ). The apostles were put into the "common prison" at the instance of the Jewish council ( Acts 5:18 Acts 5:23 ;  8:3 ); and at Philippi Paul and Silas were thrust into the "inner prison" ( 16:24 ; comp  4:3 ;  Acts 12:4 Acts 12:5 ).  </p>
Prophecy	<p>or prediction, was one of the functions of the prophet. It has been defined as a "miracle of knowledge, a declaration or description or representation of something future, beyond the power of human sagacity to foresee, discern, or conjecture." (See PROPHET .) </p><p> The great prediction which runs like a golden thread through the whole contents of the Old Testament is that regarding the coming and work of the Messiah; and the great use of prophecy was to perpetuate faith in his coming, and to prepare the world for that event. But there are many subordinate and intermediate prophecies also which hold an important place in the great chain of events which illustrate the sovereignty and all-wise overruling providence of God. </p><p> Then there are many prophecies regarding the Jewish nation, its founder Abraham ( Genesis 12:1-3 ;  13:16 ;  15:5 ;  Genesis 17:2 Genesis 17:4-6 , etc.), and his posterity, Isaac and Jacob and their descendants ( 12:7 ;  Genesis 13:14 Genesis 13:15 Genesis 13:17 ;  15:18-21 ;  Exodus 3:8 Exodus 3:17 ), which have all been fulfilled. The twenty-eighth chapter of Deuteronomy contains a series of predictions which are even now in the present day being fulfilled. In the writings of the prophets ( Isaiah 2:18-21 ), ( Jeremiah 27:3-7 ;  29:11-14 ), ( Ezekiel 5:12 ;  8 ), Daniel  Daniel 9:26 Daniel 9:27 ), ( Hosea 9:17 ), there are also many prophecies regarding the events which were to befall that people.  </p><p> There is in like manner a large number of prophecies relating to those nations with which the Jews came into contact, as Tyre ( Ezekiel 26:3-5 Ezekiel 26:14-21 ), Egypt ( Ezekiel 29:10 Ezekiel 29:15 ;  Ezekiel 30:6 Ezekiel 30:12 Ezekiel 30:13 ), Ethiopia ( Nahum 3:8-10 ), Nineveh ( Nahum 1:10 ;  2:8-13 ;  3:17-19 ), Babylon ( Isaiah 13:4 ;  Jeremiah 51:7 ;  Isaiah 44:27 ;  Jeremiah 50:38 ;  Jeremiah 51:36 Jeremiah 51:39 Jeremiah 51:57 ), the land of the Philistines ( Jeremiah 47:4-7 ; Ezek.  25:15-17 ;  Amos 1:6-8 ;  Zephaniah 2:4-7 ;  Zechariah 9:5-8 ), and of the four great monarchies ( Daniel 2:39 Daniel 2:40 ;  7:17-24 ;  8:9 ).  </p><p> But the great body of Old Testament prophecy relates directly to the advent of the Messiah, beginning with  Genesis 3:15 , the first great promise, and extending in ever-increasing fulness and clearness all through to the very close of the canon. The Messianic prophecies are too numerous to be quoted. "To him gave all the prophets witness." (Compare  Micah 5:2 ;  Haggai 2:6-9 ;  Isaiah 7:14 ;  Isaiah 9:6 Isaiah 9:7 ;  Isaiah 11:1 Isaiah 11:2 ;  53 ;  Isaiah 60:10 Isaiah 60:13 ;  Psalms 16:11 ;  68:18 .)  </p><p> Many predictions also were delivered by Jesus and his apostles. Those of Christ were very numerous. (Compare  Matthew 10:23:24; ;  11:23 ;  19:28 ;  Matthew 21:43 Matthew 21:44 ;  24 ;  25:31-46 ;  Matthew 26:17-35 Matthew 26:46 Matthew 26:64 ;  Mark 9:1 ;  10:30 ;  13 ;  Mark 11:1-6 Mark 11:14 ;  Mark 14:12-31 Mark 14:42 Mark 14:62 ;  16:17 , etc.)  </p>
Prophet	<p>(Heb. nabi, from a root meaning "to bubble forth, as from a fountain," hence "to utter", Compare  Psalms 45:1 ). This Hebrew word is the first and the most generally used for a prophet. In the time of Samuel another word, <i> ro'eh</i> , "seer", began to be used ( 1 Samuel 9:9 ). It occurs seven times in reference to Samuel. Afterwards another word, <i> hozeh</i> , "seer" ( 2 Samuel 24:11 ), was employed. In  1 Chronicles 29:29  all these three words are used: "Samuel the seer (ro'eh), Nathan the prophet (nabi'), Gad the seer" (hozeh). In Josh 13:22Balaam is called (Heb.) a <i> kosem</i> "diviner," a word used only of a false prophet. </p><p> The "prophet" proclaimed the message given to him, as the "seer" beheld the vision of God. (See   Numbers 12:6 Numbers 12:8 .) Thus a prophet was a spokesman for God; he spake in God's name and by his authority ( Exodus 7:1 ). He is the mouth by which God speaks to men ( Jeremiah 1:9 ;  Isaiah 51:16 ), and hence what the prophet says is not of man but of God ( 2 Peter 1:20 2 Peter 1:21 ; Compare  Hebrews 3:7 ;  Acts 4:25 ;  28:25 ). Prophets were the immediate organs of God for the communication of his mind and will to men ( Deuteronomy 18:18 Deuteronomy 18:19 ). The whole Word of God may in this general sense be spoken of as prophetic, inasmuch as it was written by men who received the revelation they communicated from God, no matter what its nature might be. The foretelling of future events was not a necessary but only an incidental part of the prophetic office. The great task assigned to the prophets whom God raised up among the people was "to correct moral and religious abuses, to proclaim the great moral and religious truths which are connected with the character of God, and which lie at the foundation of his government."  </p><p> Any one being a spokesman for God to man might thus be called a prophet. Thus Enoch, Abraham, and the patriarchs, as bearers of God's message ( Genesis 20:7 ;  Exodus 7:1 ;  Psalms 105:15 ), as also Moses ( Deuteronomy 18:15 ;  34:10 ;  Hosea 12:13 ), are ranked among the prophets. The seventy elders of Israel ( Numbers 11:16-29 ), "when the spirit rested upon them, prophesied;" Asaph and Jeduthun "prophesied with a harp" ( 1 Chronicles 25:3 ). Miriam and Deborah were prophetesses ( Exodus 15:20 ;  Judges 4:4 ). The title thus has a general application to all who have messages from God to men.  </p><p> But while the prophetic gift was thus exercised from the beginning, the prophetical order as such began with Samuel. Colleges, "schools of the prophets", were instituted for the training of prophets, who were constituted, a distinct order ( 1 Samuel 19:18-24 ;  2 Kings  1 Samuel 2:3 1 Samuel 2:15 ;  4:38 ), which continued to the close of the Old Testament. Such "schools" were established at Ramah, Bethel, Gilgal, Gibeah, and Jericho. The "sons" or "disciples" of the prophets were young men ( 2 Kings 5:22 ;  2 Kings 9:1 2 Kings 9:4 ) who lived together at these different "schools" ( 4:38-41 ). These young men were taught not only the rudiments of secular knowledge, but they were brought up to exercise the office of prophet, "to preach pure morality and the heart-felt worship of Jehovah, and to act along and co-ordinately with the priesthood and monarchy in guiding the state aright and checking all attempts at illegality and tyranny."  </p><p> In New Testament times the prophetical office was continued. Our Lord is frequently spoken of as a prophet ( Luke 13:33 ;  24:19 ). He was and is the great Prophet of the Church. There was also in the Church a distinct order of prophets ( 1 Corinthians 12:28 ;  Ephesians 2:20 ;  3:5 ), who made new revelations from God. They differed from the "teacher," whose office it was to impart truths already revealed.  </p><p> Of the Old Testament prophets there are sixteen, whose prophecies form part of the inspired canon. These are divided into four groups: </p><li> The prophets of the northern kingdom (Israel), viz., Hosea, Amos, Joel, Jonah.  </li><li> The prophets of Judah, viz., Isaiah, Jeremiah, Obadiah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah.  </li><li> The prophets of Captivity, viz., Ezekiel and Daniel.  </li><li> The prophets of the Restoration, viz., Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.   </li>
Propitiation	<p>that by which God is rendered propitious, i.e., by which it becomes consistent with his character and government to pardon and bless the sinner. The propitiation does not procure his love or make him loving; it only renders it consistent for him to execise his love towards sinners. </p><p> In  Romans 3:25  and  Hebrews 9:5  (A.V., "mercy-seat") the Greek word <i> hilasterion</i> is used. It is the word employed by the LXX. translators in  Exodus 25:17  and elsewhere as the equivalent for the Hebrew <i> kapporeth</i> , which means "covering," and is used of the lid of the ark of the covenant ( Exodus 25:21 ;  30:6 ). This Greek word (hilasterion) came to denote not only the mercy-seat or lid of the ark, but also propitation or reconciliation by blood. On the great day of atonement the high priest carried the blood of the sacrifice he offered for all the people within the veil and sprinkled with it the "mercy-seat," and so made propitiation.  </p><p> In  1 John 2:2 ;  4:10 , Christ is called the "propitiation for our sins." Here a different Greek word is used (hilasmos). Christ is "the propitiation," because by his becoming our substitute and assuming our obligations he expiated our guilt, covered it, by the vicarious punishment which he endured. (Compare  Hebrews 2:17 , where the expression "make reconciliation" of the A.V. is more correctly in the RSV "make propitiation.")  </p>
Proportion of faith	<p>( Romans 12:6 ). Paul says here that each one was to exercise his gift of prophecy, i.e., of teaching, "according to the proportion of faith." The meaning is, that the utterances of the "prophet" were not to fluctuate according to his own impulses or independent thoughts, but were to be adjusted to the truth revealed to him as a beliver, i.e., were to be in accordance with it.  </p><p> In post-Reformation times this phrase was used as meaning that all Scripture was to be interpreted with reference to all other Scripture, i.e., that no words or expressions were to be isolated or interpreted in a way contrary to its general teaching. This was also called the "analogy of faith." </p>
Proselyte	<p>is used in the LXX. for "stranger" ( 1 Chronicles 22:2 ), i.e., a comer to Palestine; a sojourner in the land ( Exodus 12:48 ;  20:10 ;  22:21 ), and in the New Testament for a convert to Judaism. There were such converts from early times ( Isaiah 56:3 ;  Nehemiah 10:28 ;  Esther 8:17 ). The law of Moses made specific regulations regarding the admission into the Jewish church of such as were not born Israelites ( Exodus 20:10 ;  23:12 ;  Exodus 12:19 Exodus 12:48 ;  Deuteronomy 5:14 ;  Deuteronomy 16:11 Deuteronomy 16:14 , etc.). The Kenites, the Gibeonites, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites were thus admitted to the privileges of Israelites. Thus also we hear of individual proselytes who rose to positions of prominence in Israel, as of Doeg the Edomite, Uriah the Hittite, Araunah the Jebusite, Zelek the Ammonite, Ithmah and Ebedmelech the Ethiopians.  </p><p> In the time of Solomon there were one hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred strangers in the land of Israel ( 1 Chronicles 22:2 ;  2 Chr  1 Chronicles 2:17 1 Chronicles 2:18 ). And the prophets speak of the time as coming when the strangers shall share in all the privileges of Israel ( Ezekiel 47:22 ;  Isaiah 2:2 ;  11:10 ;  56:3-6 ;  Micah 4:1 ). Accordingly, in New Testament times, we read of proselytes in the synagogues, ( Acts 10:2 Acts 10:7 ;  Acts 13:42 Acts 13:43 Acts 13:50 ;  17:4 ;  18:7 ;  Luke 7:5 ). The "religious proselytes" here spoken of were proselytes of righteousness, as distinguished from proselytes of the gate.  </p><p> The distinction between "proselytes of the gate" ( Exodus 20:10 ) and "proselytes of righteousness" originated only with the rabbis. According to them, the "proselytes of the gate" (half proselytes) were not required to be circumcised nor to comply with the Mosaic ceremonial law. They were bound only to conform to the so-called seven precepts of Noah, viz., to abstain from idolatry, blasphemy, bloodshed, uncleaness, the eating of blood, theft, and to yield obedience to the authorities. Besides these laws, however, they were required to abstain from work on the Sabbath, and to refrain from the use of leavened bread during the time of the Passover.  </p><p> The "proselytes of righteousness", religious or devout proselytes ( Acts 13:43 ), were bound to all the doctrines and precepts of the Jewish economy, and were members of the synagogue in full communion.  </p><p> The name "proselyte" occurs in the New Testament only in  Matthew 23:15 ;  Acts 2:10 ;  6:5 ;  13:43 . The name by which they are commonly designated is that of "devout men," or men "fearing God" or "worshipping God."  </p>
Proverb	<p>a trite maxim; a similitude; a parable. The Hebrew word thus rendered (mashal) has a wide signification. It comes from a root meaning "to be like," "parable." Rendered "proverb" in  Isaiah 14:4 ;  Habakkuk 2:6 ; "dark saying" in  Psalms 49:4 ,  Numbers 12:8 . Ahab's defiant words in answer to the insolent demands of Benhadad, "Let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off," is a well known instance of a proverbial saying ( 1 Kings 20:11 ).  </p>
Proverbs, Book of	<p>a collection of moral and philosophical maxims of a wide range of subjects presented in a poetic form. This book sets forth the "philosophy of practical life. It is the sign to us that the Bible does not despise common sense and discretion. It impresses upon us in the most forcible manner the value of intelligence and prudence and of a good education. The whole strength of the Hebrew language and of the sacred authority of the book is thrown upon these homely truths. It deals, too, in that refined, discriminating, careful view of the finer shades of human character so often overlooked by theologians, but so necessary to any true estimate of human life" (Stanley's Jewish Church). </p><p> As to the origin of this book, "it is probable that Solomon gathered and recast many proverbs which sprang from human experience in preceeding ages and were floating past him on the tide of time, and that he also elaborated many new ones from the material of his own experience. Towards the close of the book, indeed, are preserved some of Solomon's own sayings that seem to have fallen from his lips in later life and been gathered by other hands' (Arnot's Laws from Heaven, etc.) </p><p> This book is usually divided into three parts: </p><li> Consisting of ch. 1-9, which contain an exhibition of wisdom as the highest good.  </li><li> Consisting of ch. 10-24.  </li><li> Containing proverbs of Solomon "which the men of Hezekiah, the king of Judah, collected" (ch. 25-29).  <p> These are followed by two supplements, (1) "The words of Agur" (ch. 30); and (2) "The words of king Lemuel" (ch. 31).  </p><p> Solomon is said to have written three thousand proverbs, and those contained in this book may be a selection from these ( 1 Kings 4:32 ). In the New Testament there are thirty-five direct quotations from this book or allusions to it.  </p> </li>
Providence	<p>literally means foresight, but is generally used to denote God's preserving and governing all things by means of second causes ( Psalms 18:35 ;  63:8 ;  Acts 17:28 ;  Colossians 1:17 ;  Hebrews 1:3 ). God's providence extends to the natural world ( Psalms 104:14 ;  135:5-7 ;  Acts 14:17 ), the brute creation ( Psalms 104:21-29 ;  Matthew 6:26 ;  10:29 ), and the affairs of men ( 1 Chronicles 16:31 ;  Psalms 47:7 ;  Proverbs 21:1 ;  Job 12:23 ;  Daniel 2:21 ;  4:25 ), and of individuals ( 1 Samuel 2:6 ;  Psalms 18:30 ;  Luke 1:53 ;  James 4:13-15 ). It extends also to the free actions of men ( Exodus 12:36 ;  1 Samuel 24:9-15 ;  Psalms 33:14 Psalms 33:15 ;  Proverbs 16:1 ;  19:21 ;  20:24 ;  21:1 ), and things sinful ( 2 Samuel 16:10 ;  24:1 ;  Romans 11:32 ;  Acts 4:27 Acts 4:28 ), as well as to their good actions (Phil  2:13 ;  4:13 ;  2 co  Acts 12:9 Acts 12:10 ;  Ephesians 2:10 ;  Galatians 5:22-25 ).  </p><p> As regards sinful actions of men, they are represented as occurring by God's permission ( Genesis 45:5 ;  50:20 . Compare  1 Samuel 6:6 ;  Exodus 7:13 ;  14:17 ;  Acts 2:3 ;  3:18 ;  Acts 4:27 Acts 4:28 ), and as controlled ( Psalms 76:10 ) and overruled for good ( Genesis 50:20 ;  Acts 3:13 ). God does not cause or approve of sin, but only limits, restrains, overrules it for good.  </p><p> The mode of God's providential government is altogether unexplained. We only know that it is a fact that God does govern all his creatures and all their actions; that this government is universal ( Psalms 103:17-19 ), particular ( Matthew 10:29-31 ), efficacious ( Psalms 33:11 ;  Job 23:13 ), embraces events apparently contingent ( Proverbs 16:9 Proverbs 16:33 ;  19:21 ;  21:1 ), is consistent with his own perfection ( 2 Timothy 2:13 ), and to his own glory ( Romans 9:17 ;  11:36 ).  </p>
Psalms	<p>The psalms are the production of various authors. "Only a portion of the Book of Psalms claims David as its author. Other inspired poets in successive generations added now one now another contribution to the sacred collection, and thus in the wisdom of Providence it more completely reflects every phase of human emotion and circumstances than it otherwise could." But it is specially to David and his contemporaries that we owe this precious book. In the "titles" of the psalms, the genuineness of which there is no sufficient reason to doubt, 73 are ascribed to David. Peter and John ( Acts 4:25 ) ascribe to him also the second psalm, which is one of the 48 that are anonymous. About two-thirds of the whole collection have been ascribed to David.  </p><p>   Psalms 3962 ,62, and 77 are addressed to Jeduthun, to be sung after his manner or in his choir.  Psalms 50  and 73-83 are addressed to Asaph, as the master of his choir, to be sung in the worship of God. The "sons of Korah," who formed a leading part of the Kohathite singers ( 2 Chronicles 20:19 ), were intrusted with the arranging and singing of  Psalms 424449848587 ,44-49,84,85,87, and 88.  </p><p> In  Luke 24:44  the word "psalms" means the Hagiographa, i.e., the holy writings, one of the sections into which the Jews divided the Old Testament. (See BIBLE .) </p><p> None of the psalms can be proved to have been of a later date than the time of Ezra and Nehemiah, hence the whole collection extends over a period of about 1,000 years. There are in the New Testament 116 direct quotations from the Psalter.  </p><p> The Psalter is divided, after the analogy of the Pentateuch, into five books, each closing with a doxology or benediction: </p><li> The first book comprises the first 41 psalms, all of which are ascribed to David except 1,2,10, and 33, which, though anonymous, may also be ascribed to him.  </li><li> Book second consists of the next 31 psalms  Psalms 18  of which are ascribed to David and 1 to Solomon (the 72nd). The rest are anonymous.  </li><li> The third book contains 17 psalms (73-89), of which the 86th is ascribed to David, the 88th to Heman the Ezrahite, and the 89th to Ethan the Ezrahite.  </li><li> The fourth book also contains 17 psalms (90-106), of which the 90th is ascribed to Moses, and the 101st and 103rd to David.  </li><li> The fifth book contains the remaining psalms, 44 in number. Of these, 15 are ascribed to David, and the 127th to Solomon.  <p> Psalms 136  is generally called "the great hallel." But the Talmud includes also  Psalms 120135 -135.  <span class="badLink">Psalms 113118</span> -118, inclusive, constitute the "hallel" recited at the three great feasts, at the new moon, and on the eight days of the feast of dedication.  </p><p> "It is presumed that these several collections were made at times of high religious life: the first, probably, near the close of David's life; the second in the days of Solomon; the third by the singers of Jehoshaphat ( 2 Chronicles 20:19 ); the fourth by the men of Hezekiah (29,30,31); and the fifth in the days of Ezra."  </p><p> The Mosaic ritual makes no provision for the service of song in the worship of God. David first taught the Church to sing the praises of the Lord. He first introduced into the ritual of the tabernacle music and song. </p><p> Divers names are given to the psalms. </p></li><li> Some bear the Hebrew designation <i> shir</i> (Gr. ode, a song). Thirteen have this title. It means the flow of speech, as it were, in a straight line or in a regular strain. This title includes secular as well as sacred song. </li><li> Fifty-eight psalms bear the designation (Heb.) <i> mitsmor</i> (Gr. psalmos, a psalm), a lyric ode, or a song set to music; a sacred song accompanied with a musical instrument. </li><li> Psalms 145 , and many others, have the designation (Heb.) <i> tehillah</i> (Gr. hymnos, a hymn), meaning a song of praise; a song the prominent thought of which is the praise of God. </li><li> Six psalms (16,56-60) have the title (Heb.) <i> michtam</i> (q.v.). </li><li> Psalms 7  and  Habakkuk 3  bear the title (Heb.) <i> shiggaion</i> (q.v.).  </li>
Psaltery	<p>a musical instrument, supposed to have been a kind of lyre, or a harp with twelve strings. The Hebrew word nebhel, so rendered, is translated "viol" in  Isaiah 5:12  (RSV, "lute");  14:11 . In  Daniel 3:5 Daniel 3:7 Daniel 3:10 Daniel 3:15 , the word thus rendered is Chaldaic, pesanterin, which is supposed to be a word of Greek origin denoting an instrument of the harp kind.  </p>
Ptolemais	<p>a maritime city of Galilee ( Acts 21:7 ). It was originally called "Accho" (q.v.), and received the name Ptolemais from Ptolemy Soter when he was in possession of Coele-Syria.  </p>
Puah	<p>splendid. </p><li> One of the two midwives who feared God, and refused to kill the Hebrew male children at their birth ( Exodus 1:15-21 ).  </li><li> A descendant of Issachar ( Judges 10:1 ).   </li>
Publican	<p>one who farmed the taxes (e.g., Zacchaeus,  Luke 19:2 ) to be levied from a town or district, and thus undertook to pay to the supreme government a certain amount. In order to collect the taxes, the publicans employed subordinates ( 5:27 ;  15:1 ;  18:10 ), who, for their own ends, were often guilty of extortion and peculation. In New Testament times these taxes were paid to the Romans, and hence were regarded by the Jews as a very heavy burden, and hence also the collectors of taxes, who were frequently Jews, were hated, and were usually spoken of in very opprobrious terms. Jesus was accused of being a "friend of publicans and sinners" ( Luke 7:34 ).  </p>
Publius	<p>"the chief man of the island" of Malta ( Acts 28:7 ), who courteously entertained Paul and his shipwrecked companions for three days, till they found a more permanent place of residence; for they remained on the island for three months, till the stormy season had passed. The word here rendered "chief man" (protos) is supposed by some to be properly a Maltese term, the official title of the governor.  </p>
Pudens	<p>bashful, a Christian at Rome, who sent his greetings to Timothy ( 2 Timothy 4:21 ). (See CLAUDIA .) </p>
Pul	<p></p><li> An Assyrian king. It has been a question whether he was identical with Tiglath-pileser III. (q.v.), or was his predecessor. The weight of evidence is certainly in favour of their identity. Pul was the throne-name he bore in Babylonia as king of Babylon, and Tiglath-pileser the throne-name he bore as king of Assyria. He was the founder of what is called the second Assyrian empire. He consolidated and organized his conquests on a large scale. He subdued Northern Syria and Hamath, and the kings of Syria rendered him homage and paid him tribute. His ambition was to found in Western Asia a kingdom which should embrace the whole civilized world, having Nineveh as its centre. Menahem, king of Israel, gave him the enormous tribute of a thousand talents of silver, "that his hand might be with him" ( 2 Kings 15:19 ;  1 Chronicles 5:26 ). The fact that this tribute could be paid showed the wealthy condition of the little kingdom of Israel even in this age of disorder and misgovernment. Having reduced Syria, he turned his arms against Babylon, which he subdued. The Babylonian king was slain, and Babylon and other Chaldean cities were taken, and Pul assumed the title of "King of Sumer [i.e., Shinar] and Accad." He was succeeded by Shalmanezer IV.  </li><li> A geographical name in  Isaiah 66:19 . Probably = Phut ( Genesis 10:6 ;  Jeremiah 46:9 , RSV "Put;"  Ezekiel 27:10 ).   </li>
Pulpit	<p>( Nehemiah 8:4 ). (See EZRA .) </p>
Pulse	<p>( Daniel 1:12 Daniel 1:16 ), RSV "herbs," vegetable food in general.  </p>
Punishment	<p>The New Testament lays down the general principles of good government, but contains no code of laws for the punishment of offenders. Punishment proceeds on the principle that there is an eternal distinction between right and wrong, and that this distinction must be maintained for its own sake. It is not primarily intended for the reformation of criminals, nor for the purpose of deterring others from sin. These results may be gained, but crime in itself demands punishment. (See MURDER; THEFT .) </p><p> Endless, of the impenitent and unbelieving. The rejection of this doctrine "cuts the ground from under the gospel...blots out the attribute of retributive justice; transmutes sin into misfortune instead of guilt; turns all suffering into chastisement; converts the piacular work of Christ into moral influence...The attempt to retain the evangelical theology in connection with it is futile" (Shedd). </p>
Pur, Purim	<p>a lot, lots, a festival instituted by the Jews ( Esther 9:24-32 ) in ironical commemoration of Haman's consultation of the Pur (a Persian word), for the purpose of ascertaining the auspicious day for executing his cruel plot against their nation. It became a national institution by the common consent of the Jews, and is observed by them to the present day, on the 14th and 15th of the month Adar, a month before the Passover.  </p>
Purification	<p>the process by which a person unclean, according to the Levitical law, and thereby cut off from the sanctuary and the festivals, was restored to the enjoyment of all these privileges. </p><p> The great annual purification of the people was on the Day of Atonement (q.v.). </p><p> But in the details of daily life there were special causes of cermonial uncleanness which were severally provided for by ceremonial laws enacted for each separate case. For example, the case of the leper ( <span class="badLink">Leviticus 1314</span> ,14), and of the house defiled by leprosy ( 14:49-53 ; see also  Matthew 8:2-4 ). Uncleanness from touching a dead body ( Numbers 19:11 ;  Hosea 9:4 ;  Haggai 2:13 ;  Matthew 23:27 ;  Luke 11:44 ). The case of the high priest and of the Nazarite ( Leviticus 21:1-4 Leviticus 21:10 Leviticus 21:11 ;  Numbers 6:6 Numbers 6:7 ;  Ezekiel 44:25 ). Purification was effected by bathing and washing the clothes ( Leviticus 14:8 Leviticus 14:9 ); by washing the hands ( Deuteronomy 21:6 ;  Matthew 27:24 ); washing the hands and feet ( Exodus 30:18-21 ;  Hebrews 6:2 , "baptisms", RSV marg., "washings;"  9:10 ); sprinkling with blood and water ( Exodus 24:5-8 ;  Hebrews 9:19 ), etc. Allusions to this rite are found in  Psalms 26:6 ;  51:7 ;  Ezekiel 36:25 ;  Hebrews 10:22 .  </p>
Purse	<p></p><li> Gr. balantion, a bag ( Luke 10:4 ;  Luke 22:35 Luke 22:36 ).  </li><li> Gr. zone, properly a girdle ( Matthew 10:9 ;  Mark 6:8 ), a money-belt. As to our Lord's sending forth his disciples without money in their purses, the remark has been made that in this "there was no departure from the simple manners of the country. At this day the farmer sets out on excursions quite as extensive without a para in his purse; and a modern Moslem prophet of Tarshisha thus sends forth his apostles over this identical region. No traveller in the East would hestitate to throw himself on the hospitality of any village." Thomson's Land and the Book. (See SCRIP .)  </li>
Put, Phut	<p></p><li> One of the sons of Ham ( Genesis 10:6 ).  </li><li> A land or people from among whom came a portion of the mercenary troops of Egypt,  Jeremiah 46:9  (A.V., "Libyans," but correctly, RSV, "Put");  Ezekiel 27:10 ;  30:5  (A.V., "Libya;" RSV, "Put");  38:5 ;  Nahum 3:9 .   </li>
Puteoli	<p>a city on the coast of Campania, on the north shore of a bay running north from the Bay of Naples, at which Paul landed on his way to Rome, from which it was distant 170 miles. Here he tarried for seven days ( Acts 28:13 Acts 28:14 ). This was the great emporium for the Alexandrian corn ships. Here Paul and his companions began their journey, by the "Appian Way," to Rome. It is now called Pozzuoli. The remains of a huge amphitheatre, and of the quay at which Paul landed, may still be seen here.  </p>
Pygarg	<p>Heb. dishon, "springing", ( Deuteronomy 14:5 ), one of the animals permitted for food. It is supposed to be the Antelope addax. It is described as "a large animal, over 3 1/2 feet high at the shoulder, and, with its gently-twisted horns, 2 1/2 feet long. Its colour is pure white, with the exception of a short black mane, and a tinge of tawny on the shoulders and back.", Tristram's Natural History.  </p>
Queen	<p>No explicit mention of queens is made till we read of the "queen of Sheba." The wives of the kings of Israel are not so designated. In  Psalms 45:9 , the Hebrew for "queen" is not <i> malkah</i> , one actually ruling like the Queen of Sheba, but <i> shegal</i> , which simply means the king's wife. In  1 Kings 11:19 , Pharaoh's wife is called "the queen," but the Hebrew word so rendered (g'birah) is simply a title of honour, denoting a royal lady, used sometimes for "queen-mother" ( 1 Kings 15:13 ;  2 Chron  15:16 ). In Cant  1 Kings 6:8 1 Kings 6:9 , the king's wives are styled "queens" (Heb. melakhoth).  </p><p> In the New Testament we read of the "queen of the south", i.e., Southern Arabia, Sheba ( Matthew 12:42 ;  Luke 11:31 ) and the "queen of the Ethiopians" ( Acts 8:27 ), Candace.  </p>
Queen of heaven	<p>( Jeremiah 7:18 ;  Jeremiah 44:17 Jeremiah 44:25 ), the moon, worshipped by the Assyrians as the receptive power in nature.  </p>
Quicksands	<p>found only in  Acts 27:17 , the rendering of the Greek Syrtis. On the north coast of Africa were two localities dangerous to sailors, called the Greater and Lesser Syrtis. The former of these is probably here meant. It lies between Tripoli and Barca, and near Cyrene. The Lesser Syrtis lay farther to the west.  </p>
Quiver	<p>the sheath for arrows. The Hebrew word (aspah) thus commonly rendered is found in  Job 39:23 ;  Psalms 127:5 ;  Isaiah 22:6 ;  49:2 ;  Jeremiah 5:16 ;  Lamentations 3:13 . In  Genesis 27:3  this word is the rendering of the Hebrew <i> teli</i> , which is supposed rather to mean a suspended weapon, literally "that which hangs from one", i.e., is suspended from the shoulder or girdle. </p>
Quotations	<p>from the Old Testament in the New, which are very numerous, are not made according to any uniform method. When the New Testament was written, the Old was not divided, as it now is, into chapters and verses, and hence such peculiarities as these: When ( Luke 20:37 ) refers to  Exodus 3:6 , he quotes from "Moses at the bush", i.e., the section containing the record of Moses at the bush. So also ( Mark 2:26 ) refers to  1 Samuel 21:1-6 , in the words, "in the days of Abiathar;" and Paul ( Romans 11:2 ) refers to 1Kings ch. 17-19, in the words, "in Elias", i.e., in the portion of the history regarding Elias.  </p><p> In general, the New Testament writers quote from the Septuagint (q.v.) version of the Old Testament, as it was then in common use among the Jews. But it is noticeable that these quotations are not made in any uniform manner. Sometimes, e.g., the quotation does not agree literally either with the LXX. or the Hebrew text. This occurs in about one hundred instances. Sometimes the LXX. is literally quoted (in about ninety instances), and sometimes it is corrected or altered in the quotations (in over eighty instances). </p><p> Quotations are sometimes made also directly from the Hebrew text ( Matthew 4:15 Matthew 4:16 ;  John 19:37 ;  1 Corinthians 15:54 ). Besides the quotations made directly, there are found numberless allusions, more or less distinct, showing that the minds of the New Testament writers were filled with the expressions and ideas as well as historical facts recorded in the Old.  </p><p> There are in all two hundred and eighty-three direct quotations from the Old Testament in the New, but not one clear and certain case of quotation from the Apocrypha (q.v.). </p><p> Besides quotations in the New from the Old Testament, there are in Paul's writings three quotations from certain Greek poets,  Acts 17:28 ;  1 Corinthians 15:33 ;  Titus 1:12 . These quotations are memorials of his early classical education.  </p>
Rent	<p>( Isaiah 3:24 ), probably a rope, as rendered in the LXX. and Vulgate and Revised Version, or as some prefer interpreting the phrase, "girdle and robe are torn [i.e., are 'a rent'] by the hand of violence."  </p>
Repentance	<p>There are three Greek words used in the New Testament to denote repentance. </p><li> The verb <i> metamelomai</i> is used of a change of mind, such as to produce regret or even remorse on account of sin, but not necessarily a change of heart. This word is used with reference to the repentance of Judas ( Matthew 27:3 ).  </li><li> Metanoeo, meaning to change one's mind and purpose, as the result of after knowledge. This verb, with (3) the cognate noun <i> metanoia</i> , is used of true repentance, a change of mind and purpose and life, to which remission of sin is promised. <p> Evangelical repentance consists of (1) a true sense of one's own guilt and sinfulness; (2) an apprehension of God's mercy in Christ; (3) an actual hatred of sin ( Psalms 119:128 ;  Job 42:5 Job 42:6 ;  2 co  7:10 ) and turning from it to God; and (4) a persistent endeavour after a holy life in a walking with God in the way of his commandments.  </p><p> The true penitent is conscious of guilt ( Psalms 51:4 Psalms 51:9 ), of pollution ( Psalms 51:5 Psalms 51:7 Psalms 51:10 ), and of helplessness ( 51:11 ;  Psalms 109:21 Psalms 109:22 ). Thus he apprehends himself to be just what God has always seen him to be and declares him to be. But repentance comprehends not only such a sense of sin, but also an apprehension of mercy, without which there can be no true repentance ( Psalms 51:1 ;  130:4 ).  </p> </li>
Rephael	<p>healed of God, one of Shemaiah's sons. He and his brethren, on account of their "strength for service," formed one of the divisions of the temple porters ( 1 Chronicles 26:7 1 Chronicles 26:8 ).  </p>
Rephaim	<p>lofty men; giants, ( Genesis 14:5 ;  2 Sam  Genesis 21:16 Genesis 21:18 , marg. A.V., Rapha, marg. RSV, Raphah;  Deuteronomy 3:13 , RSV; A.V., "giants"). The aborigines of Palestine, afterwards conquered and dispossessed by the Canaanite tribes, are classed under this general title. They were known to the Moabites as Emim, i.e., "fearful", ( Deuteronomy 2:11 ), and to the Ammonites as Zamzummim. Some of them found refuge among the Philistines, and were still existing in the days of David. We know nothing of their origin. They were not necessarily connected with the "giants" (RSV, "Nephilim") of  Genesis 6:4 . (See GIANTS .) </p>
Rephaim, Valley of	<p>( Joshua 15:8 ;  18:16 , RSV). When David became king over all Israel, the Philistines, judging that he would now become their uncompromising enemy, made a sudden attack upon Hebron, compelling David to retire from it. He sought refuge in "the hold" at Adullam ( 2 Samuel 5:17-22 ), and the Philistines took up their position in the valley of Rephaim, on the west and south-west of Jerusalem. Thus all communication between Bethlehem and Jerusalem was intercepted. While David and his army were encamped here, there occurred that incident narrated in  2 Samuel 23:15-17 . Having obtained divine direction, David led his army against the Philistines, and gained a complete victory over them. The scene of this victory was afterwards called Baalperazim (q.v.).  </p><p> A second time, however, the Philistines rallied their forces in this valley ( 2 Samuel 5:22 ). Again warned by a divine oracle, David led his army to Gibeon, and attacked the Philistines from the south, inflicting on them another severe defeat, and chasing them with great slaughter to Gezer (q.v.). There David kept in check these enemies of Israel. This valley is now called el-Bukei'a.  </p>
Rephidim	<p>supports, one of the stations of the Israelites, situated in the Wady Feiran, near its junction with the Wady esh-Sheikh. Here no water could be found for the people to drink, and in their impatience they were ready to stone Moses, as if he were the cause of their distress. At the command of God Moses smote "the rock in Horeb," and a copious stream flowed forth, enough for all the people. After this the Amalekites attacked the Israelites while they were here encamped, but they were utterly defeated ( Exodus 17:1 Exodus 17:8-16 ). They were the "first of the nations" to make war against Israel ( Numbers 24:20 ).  </p><p> Leaving Rephidim, the Israelites advanced into the wilderness of Sinai ( Exodus 19:1 Exodus 19:2 ;  Numbers 33:14 Numbers 33:15 ), marching probably through the two passes of the Wady Solaf and the Wady esh-Sheikh, which converge at the entrance to the plain er-Rahah, the "desert of Sinai," which is two miles long and about half a mile broad. (See SINAI;  MERIBAH .) </p>
Reprobate	<p>that which is rejected on account of its own worthlessness ( Jeremiah 6:30 ;  Hebrews 6:8 ; Gr. adokimos, "rejected"). This word is also used with reference to persons cast away or rejected because they have failed to make use of opportunities offered them ( 1 Corinthians 9:27 ;  2 co  13:5-7 ).  </p>
Rereward	<p>( Joshua 6:9 ), the troops in the rear of an army on the march, the rear-guard. This word is a corruption of the French arriere-garde. During the wilderness march the tribe of Dan formed the rear-guard ( Numbers 10:25 ; Compare  1 Samuel 29:2 ;  Isaiah 52:12 ;  58:8 ).  </p>
Resen	<p>head of the stream; bridle, one of Nimrod's cities ( Genesis 10:12 ), "between Nineveh and Calah." It has been supposed that the four cities named in this verse were afterwards combined into one under the name of Nineveh (q.v.). Resen was on the east side of the Tigris. It is probably identified with the mound of ruins called Karamless.  </p>
Rest	<p></p><li> Gr. katapausis, equivalent to the Hebrew word <i> noah</i> ( Hebrews 4:1 ).  </li><li> Gr. anapausis, "rest from weariness" ( Matthew 11:28 ).  </li><li> Gr. anesis, "relaxation" ( 2 Thessalonians 1:7 ).  </li><li> Gr. sabbatismos, a Sabbath rest, a rest from all work ( Hebrews 4:9 ; RSV, "sabbath"), a rest like that of God when he had finished the work of creation.   </li>
Resurrection of Christ	<p>one of the cardinal facts and doctrines of the gospel. If Christ be not risen, our faith is vain ( 1 Corinthians 15:14 ). The whole of the New Testament revelation rests on this as an historical fact. On the day of Pentecost Peter argued the necessity of Christ's resurrection from the prediction in  Psalms 16  ( Acts 2:24-28 ). In his own discourses, also, our Lord clearly intimates his resurrection ( Matthew 20:19 ;  Mark 9:9 ;  14:28 ;  Luke 18:33 ;  John 2:19-22 ).  </p><p> The evangelists give circumstantial accounts of the facts connected with that event, and the apostles, also, in their public teaching largely insist upon it. Ten different appearances of our risen Lord are recorded in the New Testament. They may be arranged as follows: </p><li> To Mary Magdalene at the sepulchre alone. This is recorded at length only by ( John 20:11-18 ), and alluded to by ( Mark 16:9-11 ).  </li><li> To certain women, "the other Mary," Salome, Joanna, and others, as they returned from the sepulchre. ( Matthew 28:1-10 ) alone gives an account of this. (Compare  Mark 16:1-8 , and  Luke 24:1-11 .)  </li><li> To Simon Peter alone on the day of the resurrection. (See   Luke 24:34 ;  1 Corinthians 15:5 .)  </li><li> To the two disciples on the way to Emmaus on the day of the resurrection, recorded fully only by ( Luke 24:13-35 . Compare  Mark 16:12 Mark 16:13 ).  </li><li> To the ten disciples (Thomas being absent) and others "with them," at Jerusalem on the evening of the resurrection day. One of the evangelists gives an account of this appearance, ( John 20:19-24 ).  </li><li> To the disciples again (Thomas being present) at Jerusalem ( Mark 16:14-18 ;  Luke 24:33-40 ;  John 20:26-28 . See also  1 Corinthians 15:5 ).  </li><li> To the disciples when fishing at the Sea of Galilee. Of this appearance also ( John 21:1-23 ) alone gives an account.  </li><li> To the eleven, and above 500 brethren at once, at an appointed place in Galilee ( 1 Corinthians 15:6 ; Compare  Matthew 28:16-20 ).  </li><li> To James, but under what circumstances we are not informed ( 1 Corinthians 15:7 ).  </li><li> To the apostles immediately before the ascension. They accompanied him from Jerusalem to Mount Olivet, and there they saw him ascend "till a cloud received him out of their sight" ( Mark 16:19 ;  Luke 24:50-52 ;  Acts 1:4-10 ).  <p> It is worthy of note that it is distinctly related that on most of these occasions our Lord afforded his disciples the amplest opportunity of testing the fact of his resurrection. He conversed with them face to face. They touched him ( Matthew 28:9 ;  Luke 24:39 ;  John 20:27 ), and he ate bread with them ( Luke 24:42 Luke 24:43 ;  John 21:12 John 21:13 ).  </p></li><li> In addition to the above, mention might be made of Christ's manifestation of himself to Paul at Damascus, who speaks of it as an appearance of the risen Saviour ( Acts 9:3-9 Acts 9:17 ;  1 Corinthians 15:8 ;  9:1 ).  <p> It is implied in the words of Luke ( Acts 1:3 ) that there may have been other appearances of which we have no record.  </p><p> The resurrection is spoken of as the act (1) of God the Father ( Psalms 16:10 ;  Acts 2:24 ;  3:15 ;  Romans 8:11 ;  Ephesians 1:20 ;  Colossians 2:12 ;  Hebrews 13:20 ); (2) of Christ himself ( John 2:19 ;  10:18 ); and (3) of the Holy Spirit ( 1 Peter 3:18 ).  </p><p> The resurrection is a public testimony of Christ's release from his undertaking as surety, and an evidence of the Father's acceptance of his work of redemption. It is a victory over death and the grave for all his followers. </p><p> The importance of Christ's resurrection will be seen when we consider that if he rose the gospel is true, and if he rose not it is false. His resurrection from the dead makes it manifest that his sacrifice was accepted. Our justification was secured by his obedience to the death, and therefore he was raised from the dead ( Romans 4:25 ). His resurrection is a proof that he made a full atonement for our sins, that his sacrifice was accepted as a satisfaction to divine justice, and his blood a ransom for sinners. It is also a pledge and an earnest of the resurrection of all believers ( Romans 8:11 ;  1 Corinthians 6:14 ;  15:47-49 ; Phil  3:21 ;  1 John 3:2 ). As he lives, they shall live also.  </p><p> It proved him to be the Son of God, inasmuch as it authenticated all his claims ( John 2:19 ;  10:17 ). "If Christ did not rise, the whole scheme of redemption is a failure, and all the predictions and anticipations of its glorious results for time and for eternity, for men and for angels of every rank and order, are proved to be chimeras. 'But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first-fruits of them that slept.' Therefore the Bible is true from Genesis to Revelation. The kingdom of darkness has been overthrown, Satan has fallen as lightning from heaven, and the triumph of truth over error, of good over evil, of happiness over misery is for ever secured." Hodge.  </p><p> With reference to the report which the Roman soldiers were bribed ( Matthew 28:12-14 ) to circulate concerning Christ's resurrection, "his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept," Matthew Henry in his "Commentary," under  John 20:1-10 , fittingly remarks, "The grave-clothes in which Christ had been buried were found in very good order, which serves for an evidence that his body was not 'stolen away while men slept.' Robbers of tombs have been known to take away 'the clothes' and leave the body; but none ever took away 'the body' and left the clothes, especially when they were 'fine linen' and new ( Mark 15:46 ). Any one would rather choose to carry a dead body in its clothes than naked. Or if they that were supposed to have stolen it would have left the grave-clothes behind, yet it cannot be supposed they would find leisure to 'fold up the linen.'"  </p> </li>
Resurrection of the dead	<p>will be simultaneous both of the just and the unjust ( Daniel 12:2 ;  John 5:28 John 5:29 ;  Romans 2:6-16 ;  2 th  1:6-10 ). The qualities of the resurrection body will be different from those of the body laid in the grave ( 1 Corinthians 15:53 1 Corinthians 15:54 ; Phil  3:21 ); but its identity will nevertheless be preserved. It will still be the same body ( 1 Corinthians 15:42-44 ) which rises again.  </p><p> As to the nature of the resurrection body, (1) it will be spiritual ( 1 Corinthians 15:44 ), i.e., a body adapted to the use of the soul in its glorified state, and to all the conditions of the heavenly state; (2) glorious, incorruptible, and powerful (54); (3) like unto the glorified body of Christ (Phil  3:21 ); and (4) immortal ( Revelation 21:4 ).  </p><p> Christ's resurrection secures and illustrates that of his people. "</p><li> Because his resurrection seals and consummates his redemptive power; and the redemption of our persons involves the redemption of our bodies ( Romans 8:23 ). </li><li> Because of our federal and vital union with Christ ( 1 Corinthians 15:21 1 Corinthians 15:22 ;  1 Thessalonians 4:14 ). </li><li> Because of his Spirit which dwells in us making our bodies his members ( 1 Corinthians 6:15 ;  Romans 8:11 ). </li><li> Because Christ by covenant is Lord both of the living and the dead ( Romans 14:9 ). This same federal and vital union of the Christian with Christ likewise causes the resurrection of the believer to be similar to as well as consequent upon that of Christ ( 1 Corinthians 15:49 ; Phil  3:21 ;  1 John 3:2 )."

Reuben	<p>behold a son!, the eldest son of Jacob and Leah ( Genesis 29:32 ). His sinful conduct, referred to in  Genesis 35:22 , brought down upon him his dying father's malediction ( 48:4 ). He showed kindness to Joseph, and was the means of saving his life when his other brothers would have put him to death ( Genesis 37:21 Genesis 37:22 ). It was he also who pledged his life and the life of his sons when Jacob was unwilling to let Benjamin go down into Egypt. After Jacob and his family went down into Egypt ( 46:8 ) no further mention is made of Reuben beyond what is recorded in ch  Genesis 49:3 Genesis 49:4 .  </p>
Reuben, Tribe of	<p>at the Exodus numbered 46,500 male adults, from twenty years old and upwards ( Numbers 1:20 Numbers 1:21 ), and at the close of the wilderness wanderings they numbered only 43,730 ( 26:7 ). This tribe united with that of Gad in asking permission to settle in the "land of Gilead," "on the other side of Jordan" ( 32:1-5 ). The lot assigned to Reuben was the smallest of the lots given to the trans-Jordanic tribes. It extended from the Arnon, in the south along the coast of the Dead Sea to its northern end, where the Jordan flows into it ( Joshua 13:15-21 Joshua 13:23 ). It thus embraced the original kingdom of Sihon. Reuben is "to the eastern tribes what Simeon is to the western. 'Unstable as water,' he vanishes away into a mere Arabian tribe. 'His men are few;' it is all he can do 'to live and not die.' We hear of nothing beyond the multiplication of their cattle in the land of Gilead, their spoils of 'camels fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand' ( 1 Chronicles 5:9 1 Chronicles 5:10 1 Chronicles 5:20 1 Chronicles 5:21 ). In the great struggles of the nation he never took part. The complaint against him in the song of Deborah is the summary of his whole history. 'By the streams of Reuben,' i.e., by the fresh streams which descend from the eastern hills into the Jordan and the Dead Sea, on whose banks the Bedouin chiefs met then as now to debate, in the 'streams' of Reuben great were the 'desires'", i.e., resolutions which were never carried out, the people idly resting among their flocks as if it were a time of peace ( Judges 5:15 Judges 5:16 ). Stanley's Sinai and Palestine.  </p><p> All the three tribes on the east of Jordan at length fell into complete apostasy, and the time of retribution came. God "stirred up the spirit of Pul, king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria," to carry them away, the first of the tribes, into captivity ( 1 Chronicles 5:25 1 Chronicles 5:26 ).  </p>
Reuel	<p>friend of God. </p><li> A son of Esau and Bashemath ( Genesis 36:4 Genesis 36:10 ;  1 Chronicles 1:35 ). </li><li> "The priest of Midian," Moses' father-in-law (Ex 2:18)=Raguel ( Numbers 10:29 ). If he be identified with Jethro (q.v.), then this may be regarded as his proper name, and Jether or Jethro (i.e., "excellency") as his official title. </li><li> Numbers 2:14 , called also Deuel ( 1:14 ;  7:42 ).   </li>
Revelation	<p>an uncovering, a bringing to light of that which had been previously wholly hidden or only obscurely seen. God has been pleased in various ways and at different times ( Hebrews 1:1 ) to make a supernatural revelation of himself and his purposes and plans, which, under the guidance of his Spirit, has been committed to writing. (See WORD OF  GOD .) The Scriptures are not merely the "record" of revelation; they are the revelation itself in a written form, in order to the accurate preservation and propagation of the truth. </p><p> Revelation and inspiration differ. Revelation is the supernatural communication of truth to the mind; inspiration (q.v.) secures to the teacher or writer infallibility in communicating that truth to others. It renders its subject the spokesman or prophet of God in such a sense that everything he asserts to be true, whether fact or doctrine or moral principle, is true, infallibly true. </p>
Revelation of Christ	<p>the second advent of Christ. Three different Greek words are used by the apostles to express this, (1) apokalupsis (1co. ( 1 Corinthians 2 th  1:7 ;  1 Peter 1:7 1 Peter 1:13 ); (2) parousia ( Matthew 24:3 Matthew 24:27 ;  1 Thessalonians 2:19 ;  James 5:7 James 5:8 ); (3) epiphaneia ( 1 Timothy 6:14 ;  2 Tim  1:10 ;  4:1-8 ;  Titus 2:13 ). There existed among Christians a wide expectation, founded on  Matthew 24:29 Matthew 24:30 Matthew 24:34 , of the speedy return of Christ. (See MILLENNIUM .) </p>
Revelation, Book of	<p>=The Apocalypse, the closing book and the only prophetical book of the New Testament canon. The author of this book was undoubtedly John the apostle. His name occurs four times in the book itself ( Hebrews 1:1 Hebrews 1:4 Hebrews 1:9 ;  <span class="badLink">22:8</span> ), and there is every reason to conclude that the "John" here mentioned was the apostle. In a manuscript of about the twelfth century he is called "John the divine," but no reason can be assigned for this appellation.  </p><p> The date of the writing of this book has generally been fixed at A.D. 96, in the reign of Domitian. There are some, however, who contend for an earlier date, A.D. 68 or 69, in the reign of Nero. Those who are in favour of the later date appeal to the testimony of the Christian father Irenaeus, who received information relative to this book from those who had seen John face to face. He says that the Apocalypse "was seen no long time ago."  </p><p> As to the relation between this book and the Gospel of John, it has been well observed that "the leading ideas of both are the same. The one gives us in a magnificent vision, the other in a great historic drama, the supreme conflict between good and evil and its issue. In both Jesus Christ is the central figure, whose victory through defeat is the issue of the conflict. In both the Jewish dispensation is the preparation for the gospel, and the warfare and triumph of the Christ is described in language saturated with the Old Testament. The difference of date will go a long way toward explaining the difference of style." Plummer's Gospel of St. John, Introd. </p>
Rezeph	<p>solid; a stone, ( 2 Kings 19:12 ;  Isaiah 37:12 ), a fortress near Haran, probably on the west of the Euphrates, conquered by Sennacherib.  </p>
Rezin	<p>firm; a prince, a king of Syria, who joined Pekah (q.v.) in an invasion of the kingdom of Judah ( 2 Kings 15:37 ;  16:5-9 ;  Isaiah 7:1-8 ). Ahaz induced Tiglath-pileser III. to attack Damascus, and this caused Rezin to withdraw for the purpose of defending his own kingdom. Damascus was taken, and Rezin was slain in battle by the Assyrian king, and his people carried into captivity, B.C. 732 ( 2 Kings 16:9 ).  </p>
Rezon	<p>prince, son of Eliadah. Abandoning the service of Hadadezer, the king of Zobah, on the occasion of his being defeated by David, he became the "captain over a band" of marauders, and took Damascus, and became king of Syria ( 1 Kings 11:23-25 ;  2 Sam.  8:3-8 ). For centuries after this the Syrians were the foes of Israel. He "became an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon."  </p>
Rhegium	<p>breach, a town in the south of Italy, on the Strait of Messina, at which Paul touched on his way to Rome ( Acts 28:13 ). It is now called Rheggio.  </p>
Rhesa	<p>affection, son of Zorobabel, mentioned in the genealogy of our Lord ( Luke 3:27 ).  </p>
Rhoda	<p>a rose, the damsel in the house of Mary, the mother of John Mark. She came to hearken when Peter knocked at the door of the gate ( Acts 12:12-15 ).  </p>
Rhodes	<p>a rose, an island to the south of the western extremity of Asia Minor, between Coos and Patara, about 46 miles long and 18 miles broad. Here the apostle probably landed on his way from Greece to Syria ( Acts 21:1 ), on returning from his third missionary journey.  </p>
Riblah	<p>fruitful, an ancient town on the northern frontier of Palestine, 35 miles north-east of Baalbec, and 10 or 12 south of Lake Homs, on the eastern bank of the Orontes, in a wide and fertile plain. Here Nebuchadnezzar had his head-quarters in his campaign against Jerusalem, and here also Necho fixed his camp after he had routed Josiah's army at Megiddo ( 2 Kings 23:29-35 ;  2 Kings 25:6 2 Kings 25:20 2 Kings 25:21 ;  Jeremiah 39:5 ;  52:10 ). It was on the great caravan road from Palestine to Carchemish, on the Euphrates. It is described ( Numbers 34:11 ) as "on the eastern side of Ain." A place still called el Ain, i.e., "the fountain", is found in such a position about 10 miles distant. (See JERUSALEM .) </p>
Riddle	<p>(Heb. hodah). The oldest and, strictly speaking, the only example of a riddle was that propounded by Samson (Judg.  14:12-18 ). The parabolic prophecy in  Ezekiel 17:2-18  is there called a "riddle." It was rather, however, an allegory. The word "darkly" in  1 Corinthians 13:12  is the rendering of the Greek enigma; marg., "in a riddle."  </p>
Righteousness	<p>See JUSTIFICATION . </p>
Rimmon	<p>pomegranate. </p><li> A man of Beeroth ( 2 Samuel 4:2 ), one of the four Gibeonite cities. (See   Joshua 9:17 .)  </li><li> A Syrian idol, mentioned only in  2 Kings 5:18 .  </li><li> One of the "uttermost cities" of Judah, afterwards given to Simeon ( Joshua 15:21 Joshua 15:32 ;  19:7 ;  1 Chronicles 4:32 ). In Josh 15:32Ain and Rimmon are mentioned separately, but in  19:7  and  1 Chronicles 4:32  (Compare  Nehemiah 11:29 ) the two words are probably to be combined, as forming together the name of one place, Ain-Rimmon=the spring of the pomegranate. It has been identified with Um er-Rumamin, about 13 miles south-west of Hebron.  </li><li> "Rock of," to which the Benjamites fled ( Judges 20:45 Judges 20:47 ;  21:13 ), and where they maintained themselves for four months after the fearful battle at Gibeah, in which they were almost exterminated, 600 only surviving out of about 27,000. It is the present village of Rummon, "on the very edge of the hill country, with a precipitous descent toward the Jordan valley," supposed to be the site of Ai.   </li>
Rimmon-parez	<p>a pomegranate breach, or Rimmon of the breach, one of the stations of the Israelites in the wilderness ( Numbers 33:19 Numbers 33:20 ).  </p>
Ring	<p>Used as an ornament to decorate the fingers, arms, wrists, and also the ears and the nose. Rings were used as a signet ( Genesis 38:18 ). They were given as a token of investment with authority ( Genesis 41:42 ;  Esther 3:8-10 ;  8:2 ), and of favour and dignity ( Luke 15:22 ). They were generally worn by rich men ( James 2:2 ). They are mentioned by Isiah ( <span class="badLink">3:21</span> ) among the adornments of Hebrew women.  </p>
Riphath	<p>a crusher, Gomer's second son ( Genesis 10:3 ), supposed to have been the ancestor of the Paphlagonians.  </p>
Rissah	<p>heap of ruins; dew, a station of the Israelites in the wilderness ( Numbers 33:21 Numbers 33:22 ).  </p>
Rithmah	<p>wild broom, a station in the wilderness ( Numbers 33:18 Numbers 33:19 ), the "broom valley," or "valley of broombushes," the place apparently of the original encampment of Israel, near Kadesh.  </p>
River	<p></p><li> Heb. 'aphik, properly the channel or ravine that holds water ( 2 Samuel 22:16 ), translated "brook," "river," "stream," but not necessarily a perennial stream ( Ezekiel 6:3 ;  31:12 ;  32:6 ;  34:13 ).  </li><li> Heb. nahal, in winter a "torrent," in summer a "wady" or valley ( Genesis 32:23 ;  Deuteronomy 2:24 ;  3:16 ;  Isaiah 30:28 ;  Lamentations 2:18 ;  Ezekiel 47:9 ).  <p> These winter torrents sometimes come down with great suddenness and with desolating force. A distinguished traveller thus describes his experience in this matter:, "I was encamped in Wady Feiran, near the base of Jebel Serbal, when a tremendous thunderstorm burst upon us. After little more than an hour's rain, the water rose so rapidly in the previously dry wady that I had to run for my life, and with great difficulty succeeded in saving my tent and goods; my boots, which I had not time to pick up, were washed away. In less than two hours a dry desert wady upwards of 300 yards broad was turned into a foaming torrent from 8 to 10 feet deep, roaring and tearing down and bearing everything upon it, tangled masses of tamarisks, hundreds of beautiful palmtrees, scores of sheep and goats, camels and donkeys, and even men, women, and children, for a whole encampment of Arabs was washed away a few miles above me. The storm commenced at five in the evening; at half-past nine the waters were rapidly subsiding, and it was evident that the flood had spent its force." (Compare  Matthew 7:27 ;  Luke 6:49 .)  </p></li><li> Nahar, a "river" continuous and full, a perennial stream, as the Jordan, the Euphrates ( Genesis 2:10 ;  15:18 ;  Deuteronomy 1:7 ;  Psalms 66:6 ;  Ezekiel 10:15 ).  </li><li> Tel'alah, a conduit, or water-course ( 1 Kings 18:32 ;  2 Kings  18:17 ;  20:20 ;  Job 38:25 ;  Ezekiel 31:4 ).  </li><li> Peleg, properly "waters divided", i.e., streams divided, throughout the land ( Psalms 1:3 ); "the rivers [i.e., 'divisions'] of waters" ( Job 20:17 ;  29:6 ;  Proverbs 5:16 ).  </li><li> Ye'or, i.e., "great river", probably from an Egyptian word (Aur), commonly applied to the Nile ( Genesis 41:1-3 ), but also to other rivers ( Job 28:10 ;  Isaiah 33:21 ).  </li><li> Yubhal, "a river" ( Jeremiah 17:8 ), a full flowing stream.  </li><li> 'Ubhal, "a river" ( Daniel 8:2 ).   </li>
River of Egypt	<p></p><li> Heb. nahar mitsraim, denotes in  Genesis 15:18  the Nile, or its eastern branch ( 2 Chronicles 9:26 ). </li><li> In  Numbers 34:5  (RSV, "brook of Egypt") the Hebrew word is <i> nahal</i> , denoting a stream flowing rapidly in winter, or in the rainy season. This is a desert stream on the borders of Egypt. It is now called the Wady el-'Arish. The present boundary between Egypt and Palestine is about midway between this wady and Gaza. (See   Numbers 34:5 ;  Joshua 15:4 Joshua 15:47 ;  1 Kings 8:65 ;  2 Kings  <span class="badLink">24:7</span> ;  Isaiah 27:12 ;  Ezekiel 47:19 . In all these passages the RSV has "brook" and the A.V. "river.")   </li>
River of Gad	<p>probably the Arno ( 2 Samuel 24:5 ).  </p>
River of God	<p>( Psalms 65:9 ), as opposed to earthly streams, denoting that the divine resources are inexhaustible, or the sum of all fertilizing streams that water the earth ( Genesis 2:10 ).  </p>
Rivers of Babylon	<p>( Psalms 137:1 ), i.e., of the whole country of Babylonia, e.g., the Tigris, Euphrates, Chalonas, the Ulai, and the numerous canals.  </p>
Rivers of Damascus	<p>the Abana and Pharpar ( 2 Kings 5:12 ).  </p>
Rivers of Judah	<p>( Joel 3:18 ), the watercourses of Judea.  </p>
Rizpah	<p>coal; hot stone, the daughter of Aiah, and one of Saul's concubines. She was the mother of Armoni and Mephibosheth ( 2 Samuel 3:7 ;  2 Samuel 21:8 2 Samuel 21:10 2 Samuel 21:11 ).  </p><p> It happened that a grievous famine, which lasted for three years, fell upon the land during the earlier half of David's reign at Jerusalem. This calamity was sent "for Saul and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites." David inquired of the Gibeonites what satisfaction they demanded, and was answered that nothing would compensate for the wrong Saul had done to them but the death of seven of Saul's sons. David accordingly delivered up to them the two sons of Rizpah and five of the sons of Merab (q.v.), Saul's eldest daughter, whom she bore to Adriel. These the Gibeonites put to death, and hung up their bodies before the Lord at the sanctuary at Gibeah. Rizpah thereupon took her place on the rock of Gibeah (q.v.), and for five months watched the suspended bodies of her children, to prevent them from being devoured by the beasts and birds of prey, till they were at length taken down and buried by David. </p><p> Her marriage to Abner was the occasion of a quarrel between him and Ishbosheth, which led to Abner's going over to the side of David ( 2 Samuel 3:17-21 ).  </p>
Road	<p>( 1 Samuel 27:10 ; RSV, "raid"), an inroad, an incursion. This word is never used in Scripture in the sense of a way or path.  </p>
Robbery	<p>Practised by the Ishmaelites ( Genesis 16:12 ), the Chaldeans and Sabeans ( Job 1:15 Job 1:17 ), and the men of Shechem ( Judges 9:25 . See also  1 Samuel 27:6-10 ;  30 ;  Hosea 4:2 ;  6:9 ). Robbers infested Judea in our Lord's time ( Luke 10:30 ;  John 18:40 ;  Acts 5:36 Acts 5:37 ;  21:38 ;  2 co  11:26 ). The words of the Authorized Version, "counted it not robbery to be equal," etc. (Phil  Acts 2:6 Acts 2:7 ), are better rendered in the Revised Version, "counted it not a prize to be on an equality," etc., i.e., "did not look upon equality with God as a prize which must not slip from his grasp" = "did not cling with avidity to the prerogatives of his divine majesty; did not ambitiously display his equality with God."  </p><p> "Robbers of churches" should be rendered, as in the Revised Version, "of temples." In the temple at Ephesus there was a great treasure-chamber, and as all that was laid up there was under the guardianship of the goddess Diana, to steal from such a place would be sacrilege ( Acts 19:37 ).  </p>
Rock	<p>(Heb. tsur), employed as a symbol of God in the Old Testament ( 1 Samuel 2:2 ;  2 Sam  22:3 ;  Isaiah 17:10 ;  Psalms 28:1 ;  Psalms 31:2 Psalms 31:3 ;  89:26 ;  95:1 ); also in the New Testament ( Matthew 16:18 ;  Romans 9:33 ;  1 Corinthians 10:4 ). In  Daniel 2:45  the Chaldaic form of the Hebrew word is translated "mountain." It ought to be translated "rock," as in  Habakkuk 1:12  in the Revised Version. The "rock" from which the stone is cut there signifies the divine origin of Christ. (See STONE .) </p>
Roe	<p>(Heb. tsebi), properly the gazelle (Arab. ghazal), permitted for food ( Deuteronomy 14:5 ; Compare  Deuteronomy 12:15 Deuteronomy 12:22 ;  15:22 ;  1 Kings 4:23 ), noted for its swiftness and beauty and grace of form ( 2 Samuel 2:18 ;  1 Chronicles 12:8 ; Cant  2:9 ;  7:3 ;  8:14 ).  </p><p> The gazelle (Gazella dorcas) is found in great numbers in Palestine. "Among the gray hills of Galilee it is still 'the roe upon the mountains of Bether,' and I have seen a little troop of gazelles feeding on the Mount of Olives close to Jerusalem itself" (Tristram). </p><p> The Hebrew word ('ayyalah) in  Proverbs 5: :  19  thus rendered (RSV, "doe"), is properly the "wild she-goat," the mountain goat, the ibex. (See   1 Samuel 24:2 ;  Psalms 104:18 ;  Job 39:1 .)  </p>
Rogelim	<p>fullers, a town of Gilead, the residence of Barzillai the Gileadite ( 2 Samuel 17:27 ;  19:31 ), probably near to Mahanaim.  </p>
Roll	<p>the common form of ancient books. The Hebrew word rendered "roll" or "volume" is <i> meghillah</i> , found in  Ezra 6:2 ;  Psalms 40:7 ;  Jeremiah 36:2 Jeremiah 36:6 Jeremiah 36:23 Jeremiah 36:28 Jeremiah 36:29 ;  Ezekiel 2:9 ;  3:1-3 ;  Zechariah 5:1 Zechariah 5:2 . "Rolls" (Chald. pl. of sephar, corresponding to Heb. sepher) in  Ezra 6:1  is rendered in the Revised Version "archives." In the New Testament the word "volume" ( Hebrews 10:7 ; RSV, "roll") occurs as the rendering of the Greek kephalis, meaning the head or top of the stick or cylinder on which the manuscript was rolled, and hence the manuscript itself. (See BOOK .) </p>
Romamti-ezer	<p>elevation of help, one of the sons of Heman, "the king's seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn." He was head of the "four-and-twentieth" course of singers ( 1 Chronicles 25:4 1 Chronicles 25:31 ).  </p>
Romans, Epistle to the	<p>This epistle was probably written at Corinth. Phoebe ( Romans 16:1 ) of Cenchrea conveyed it to Rome, and Gaius of Corinth entertained the apostle at the time of his writing it ( 16:23 ;  1 Corinthians 1:14 ), and Erastus was chamberlain of the city, i.e., of Corinth ( 2 Timothy 4:20 ).  </p><p> The precise time at which it was written is not mentioned in the epistle, but it was obviously written when the apostle was about to "go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints", i.e., at the close of his second visit to Greece, during the winter preceding his last visit to that city ( Romans 15:25 ; Compare  Acts 19:21 ;  Acts 20:2 Acts 20:3 Acts 20:16 ;  1 Corinthians 16:1-4 ), early in A.D. 58.  </p><p> It is highly probable that Christianity was planted in Rome by some of those who had been at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost ( Acts 2:10 ). At this time the Jews were very numerous in Rome, and their synagogues were probably resorted to by Romans also, who in this way became acquainted with the great facts regarding Jesus as these were reported among the Jews. Thus a church composed of both Jews and Gentiles was formed at Rome. Many of the brethren went out to meet Paul on his approach to Rome. There are evidences that Christians were then in Rome in considerable numbers, and had probably more than one place of meeting ( Romans 16:14 Romans 16:15 ).  </p><p> The object of the apostle in writing to this church was to explain to them the great doctrines of the gospel. His epistle was a "word in season." Himself deeply impressed with a sense of the value of the doctrines of salvation, he opens up in a clear and connected form the whole system of the gospel in its relation both to Jew and Gentile. This epistle is peculiar in this, that it is a systematic exposition of the gospel of universal application. The subject is here treated argumentatively, and is a plea for Gentiles addressed to Jews. In the Epistle to the Galatians, the same subject is discussed, but there the apostle pleads his own authority, because the church in Galatia had been founded by him. </p><p> After the introduction ( 1:1-15 ), the apostle presents in it divers aspects and relations the doctrine of justification by faith ( (1:16-11:36) ) on the ground of the imputed righteousness of Christ. He shows that salvation is all of grace, and only of grace. This main section of his letter is followed by various practical exhortations ( (12:1-15:13), ), which are followed by a conclusion containing personal explanations and salutations, which contain the names of twenty-four Christians at Rome, a benediction, and a doxology (Rom ( Romans 16 ).  </p>
Rome	<p>the most celebrated city in the world at the time of Christ. It is said to have been founded B.C. 753. When the New Testament was written, Rome was enriched and adorned with the spoils of the world, and contained a population estimated at 1,200,000, of which the half were slaves, and including representatives of nearly every nation then known. It was distinguished for its wealth and luxury and profligacy. The empire of which it was the capital had then reached its greatest prosperity.  </p><p> On the day of Pentecost there were in Jerusalem "strangers from Rome," who doubtless carried with them back to Rome tidings of that great day, and were instrumental in founding the church there. Paul was brought to this city a prisoner, where he remained for two years ( Acts 28:30 Acts 28:31 ) "in his own hired house." While here, Paul wrote his epistles to the Philippians, to the Ephesians, to the Colossians, to Philemon, and probably also to the Hebrews. He had during these years for companions Luke and Aristarchus ( Acts 27:2 ), Timothy (Phil  1:1 ;  Colossians 1:1 ), Tychicus ( Ephesians 6: :  21 ), Epaphroditus (Phil  4:18 ), and John Mark ( Colossians 4:10 ). (See PAUL .) </p><p> Beneath this city are extensive galleries, called "catacombs," which were used from about the time of the apostles (one of the inscriptions found in them bears the date A.D. 71) for some three hundred years as places of refuge in the time of persecution, and also of worship and burial. About four thousand inscriptions have been found in the catacombs. These give an interesting insight into the history of the church at Rome down to the time of Constantine.  </p>
Rose	<p>Many varieties of the rose proper are indigenous to Syria. The famed rose of Damascus is white, but there are also red and yellow roses. In Cant  2:1  and  Isaiah 35:1  the Hebrew word <i> habatstseleth</i> (found only in these passages), rendered "rose" (RSV marg., "autumn crocus"), is supposed by some to mean the oleander, by others the sweet-scented narcissus (a native of Palestine), the tulip, or the daisy; but nothing definite can be affirmed regarding it. </p><p> The "rose of Sharon" is probably the cistus or rock-rose, several species of which abound in Palestine. "Mount Carmel especially abounds in the cistus, which in April covers some of the barer parts of the mountain with a glow not inferior to that of the Scottish heather." (See MYRRH [2].)  </p>
Rosh	<p>( Ezekiel 38:2 Ezekiel 38:3 ;  39:1 ) is rendered "chief" in the Authorized Version. It is left untranslated as a proper name in the Revised Version. Some have supposed that the Russians are here meant, as one of the three Scythian tribes of whom Magog was the prince. They invaded the land of Judah in the days of Josiah. Herodotus, the Greek historian, says: "For twenty-eight years the Scythians ruled over Asia, and things were turned upside down by their violence and contempt." (See BETHSHEAN .) </p>
Rosin	<p>found only in Authorized Version, margin,  Ezekiel 27:17 , Heb. tsori, uniformly rendered elsewhere "balm" (q.v.), as here in the text. The Vulgate has resinam, rendered "rosin" in the Douay Version. As used, however, by Jerome, the Lat. resina denotes some odoriferous gum or oil.  </p>
Ruby	<p>(Heb. peninim), only in plural ( Lamentations 4:7 ). The ruby was one of the stones in the high priest's breastplate ( Exodus 28:17 ). A comparison is made between the value of wisdom and rubies ( Job 28:18 ;  Proverbs 3:15 ;  8:11 ). The price of a virtuous woman is said to be "far above rubies" ( Proverbs 31:10 ). The exact meaning of the Hebrew word is uncertain. Some render it "red coral;" others, "pearl" or "mother-of-pearl."  </p>
Rudder bands	<p>Ancient ships had two great broad-bladed oars for rudders. These, when not in use, were lifted out of the water and bound or tied up. When required for use, these bands were unloosed and the rudders allowed to drop into the water ( Acts 27:40 ).  </p>
Rue	<p>a garden herb (Ruta graveolens) which the Pharisees were careful to tithe ( Luke 11:42 ), neglecting weightier matters. It is omitted in the parallel passage of  Matthew 23:23 . There are several species growing wild in Palestine. It is used for medicinal and culinary purposes. It has a powerful scent, and is a stimulant. (See MINT .) </p>
Rufus	<p>red, the son of Simon the Cyrenian ( Mark 15:21 ), whom the Roman soldiers compelled to carry the cross on which our Lord was crucified. Probably it is the same person who is again mentioned in  Romans 16:13  as a disciple at Rome, whose mother also was a Christian held in esteem by the apostle. Mark mentions him along with his brother Alexander as persons well known to his readers ( Mark 15:21 ).  </p>
Ruhamah	<p>having obtained mercy, a symbolical name given to the daughter of ( Hosea 2:1 ).  </p>
Rumah	<p>elevation, probably the same as Arumah ( Judges 9:41 ;  2 Kings  23:36 ), near Shechem. Others identify it with Tell Rumeh, in Galilee, about 6 miles north of Nazareth.  </p>
Rush	<p>the papyrus ( Job 8:11 ). (See BULRUSH .) The expression "branch and rush" in  Isaiah 9:14 ;  19:15  means "utterly."  </p>
Ruth	<p>a friend, a Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, whose father, Elimelech, had settled in the land of Moab. On the death of Elimelech and Mahlon, Naomi came with Ruth, her daughter-in-law, who refused to leave her, to Bethlehem, the old home from which Elimelech had migrated. There she had a rich relative, Boaz, to whom Ruth was eventually married. She became the mother of Obed, the grandfather of David. Thus Ruth, a Gentile, is among the maternal progenitors of our Lord ( Matthew 1:5 ). The story of "the gleaner Ruth illustrates the friendly relations between the good Boaz and his reapers, the Jewish land system, the method of transferring property from one person to another, the working of the Mosaic law for the relief of distressed and ruined families; but, above all, handing down the unselfishness, the brave love, the unshaken trustfulness of her who, though not of the chosen race, was, like the Canaanitess Tamar ( Genesis 38:29 ;  Matthew 1:3 ) and the Canaanitess Rahab ( Matthew 1:5 ), privileged to become the ancestress of David, and so of 'great David's greater Son'" ( Ruth 4:18-22 ).  </p>
Ruth The Book of	<p>was originally a part of the Book of Judges, but it now forms one of the twenty-four separate books of the Hebrew Bible. </p><p> The history it contains refers to a period perhaps about one hundred and twenty-six years before the birth of David. It gives (1) an account of Naomi's going to Moab with her husband, Elimelech, and of her subsequent return to Bethlehem with her daughter-in-law; (2) the marriage of Boaz and Ruth; and (3) the birth of Obed, of whom David sprang.  </p><p> The author of this book was probably Samuel, according to Jewish tradition. </p><p> "Brief as this book is, and simple as is its story, it is remarkably rich in examples of faith, patience, industry, and kindness, nor less so in indications of the care which God takes of those who put their trust in him." </p>
Rye	<p>=Rie, (Heb. kussemeth), found in  Exodus 9:32 ;  Isaiah 28:25 , in all of which the margins of the Authorized and of the Revised Versions have "spelt." This Hebrew word also occurs in  Ezekiel 4:9 , where the Authorized Version has "fitches' (q.v.) and the Revised Version "spelt." This, there can be no doubt, was the Triticum spelta, a species of hard, rough-grained wheat.  </p>
Sheshbazzar	<p>O sun-god, defend the lord! ( Ezra 1:8 Ezra 1:11 ), probably another name for Zerubbabel (q.v.),  Ezra 2:2 ;  Haggai 1:12 Haggai 1:14 ;  Zechariah 4:6 Zechariah 4:10 .  </p>
Sheth	<p>tumult. </p><li> "The children of Sheth" ( Numbers 24:17 ); RSV, "the sons of tumult," which is probably the correct rendering, as there is no evidence that this is a proper name here.  </li><li> The antediluvian patriarch ( 1 Chronicles 1:1 ).   </li>
Shethar	<p>a star, a prince at the court of Ahasuerus ( Esther 1:14 ).  </p>
Shethar-boznai	<p>star of splendour, a Persian officer who vainly attempted to hinder the rebuilding of the temple ( Ezra 5:3 Ezra 5:6 ;  Ezra 6:6 Ezra 6:13 ).  </p>
Sheva	<p>Heb. Shebher. </p><li> The son of Caleb ( 1 Chronicles 2:49 ).  </li><li> Heb. Sheva', one of David's scribes ( 2 Samuel 20:25 ).   </li>
Shewbread	<p> Exodus 25:30  (RSV marg., "presence bread");  1 Chronicles 9:32  (marg., "bread of ordering");  Numbers 4:7 : called "hallowed bread" (RSV, "holy bread") in  1 Samuel 21:1-6 .  </p><p> This bread consisted of twelve loaves made of the finest flour. They were flat and thin, and were placed in two rows of six each on a table in the holy place before the Lord. They were renewed every Sabbath ( Leviticus 24:5-9 ), and those that were removed to give place to the new ones were to be eaten by the priests only in the holy place (see  1 Samuel 21:3-6 ; Compare  Matthew 12:3 Matthew 12:4 ).  </p><p> The number of the loaves represented the twelve tribes of Israel, and also the entire spiritual Israel, "the true Israel;" and the placing of them on the table symbolized the entire consecration of Israel to the Lord, and their acceptance of God as their God. The table for the bread was made of acacia wood, 3 feet long, 18 inches broad, and 2 feet 3 inches high. It was plated with pure gold. Two staves, plated with gold, passed through golden rings, were used for carrying it.  </p>
Shibboleth	<p>river, or an ear of corn. The tribes living on the east of Jordan, separated from their brethren on the west by the deep ravines and the rapid river, gradually came to adopt peculiar customs, and from mixing largely with the Moabites, Ishmaelites, and Ammonites to pronounce certain letters in such a manner as to distinguish them from the other tribes. Thus when the Ephraimites from the west invaded Gilead, and were defeated by the Gileadites under the leadership of Jephthah, and tried to escape by the "passages of the Jordan," the Gileadites seized the fords and would allow none to pass who could not pronounce "shibboleth" with a strong aspirate. This the fugitives were unable to do. They said "sibboleth," as the word was pronounced by the tribes on the west, and thus they were detected (Judg.  12:1-6 ). Forty-two thousand were thus detected, and  </p><p> "Without reprieve, adjudged to death,  For want of well-pronouncing shibboleth." </p>
Shibmah	<p>fragrance, a town of Reuben, east of Jordan ( Numbers 32:38 ).  </p>
Shield	<p>used in defensive warfare, varying at different times and under different circumstances in size, form, and material ( 1 Samuel 17:7 ;  2 Sam  1:21 ;  1 Kings 10:17 ;  1 Chronicles 12:8 1 Chronicles 12:24 1 Chronicles 12:34 ;  Isaiah 22:6 ;  Ezekiel 39:9 ;  Nahum 2:3 ).  </p><p> Used figuratively of God and of earthly princes as the defenders of their people ( Genesis 15:1 ;  Deuteronomy 33:29 ;  Psalms 33:20 ;  84:11 ). Faith is compared to a shield ( Ephesians 6:16 ).  </p><p> Shields were usually "anointed" ( Isaiah 21:5 ), in order to preserve them, and at the same time make the missiles of the enemy glide off them more easily.  </p>
Shiggaion	<p>from the verb shagah, "to reel about through drink," occurs in the title of  Psalms 7 . The plural form, shigionoth, is found in  Habakkuk 3:1 . The word denotes a lyrical poem composed under strong mental emotion; a song of impassioned imagination accompanied with suitable music; a dithyrambic ode.  </p>
Shihon	<p>overturning, a town of Issachar ( Joshua 19:19 ).  </p>
Shihor	<p>dark, ( 1 Chronicles 13:5 ), the southwestern boundary of Canaan, the Wady el-'Arish. (See SIHOR;  NILE .) </p>
Shihor-Libnath	<p>black-white, a stream on the borders of Asher, probably the modern Nahr Zerka, i.e., the "crocodile brook," or "blue river", which rises in the Carmel range and enters the Mediterranean a little to the north of Caesarea ( Joshua 19:26 ). Crocodiles are still found in the Zerka. Thomson suspects "that long ages ago some Egyptians, accustomed to worship this ugly creature, settled here (viz., at Caesarea), and brought their gods with them. Once here they would not easily be exterminated" (The Land and the Book).  </p>
Shilhim	<p>aqueducts, a town in the south of Judah ( Joshua 15:32 ); called also Sharuhen and Shaaraim ( 19:6 ).  </p>
Shiloah, The waters of	<p>=Siloah, ( Nehemiah 3:15 ) and Siloam (q.v.)  </p>
Shiloh	<p>generally understood as denoting the Messiah, "the peaceful one," as the word signifies ( Genesis 49:10 ). The Vulgate Version translates the word, "he who is to be sent," in allusion to the Messiah; the Revised Version, margin, "till he come to Shiloh;" and the LXX., "until that which is his shall come to Shiloh." It is most simple and natural to render the expression, as in the Authorized Version, "till Shiloh come," interpreting it as a proper name (Compare  Isaiah 9:6 ).  </p><p> Shiloh, a place of rest, a city of Ephraim, "on the north side of Bethel," from which it is distant 10 miles ( Judges 21:19 ); the modern Seilun (the Arabic for Shiloh), a "mass of shapeless ruins." Here the tabernacle was set up after the Conquest ( Joshua 18:1-10 ), where it remained during all the period of the judges till the ark fell into the hands of the Philistines. "No spot in Central Palestine could be more secluded than this early sanctuary, nothing more featureless than the landscape around; so featureless, indeed, the landscape and so secluded the spot that from the time of St. Jerome till its re-discovery by Dr. Robinson in 1838 the very site was forgotten and unknown." It is referred to by ( Jeremiah 7:12 Jeremiah 7:14 ;  26:4-9 ) five hundred years after its destruction.  </p>
Shilonite	<p>Ahijah the prophet, whose home was in Shiloh, is so designated ( 1 Kings 11:29 ;  15:29 ). The plural form occurs ( 1 Chronicles 9:5 ), denoting the descendants of Shelah, Judah's youngest son.  </p>
Shimea	<p>the hearing prayer. </p><li> One of David's sons by Bathsheba ( 1 Chronicles 3:5 ); called also Shammua ( 14:4 ).  </li><li> A Levite of the family of Merari ( 1 Chronicles 6:30 ).  </li><li> Another Levite of the family of Gershon ( 1 Chronicles 6:39 ).  </li><li> One of David's brothers ( 1 Samuel 16:9 , marg.).   </li>
Shimeah	<p></p><li> One of David's brothers ( 2 Samuel 13:3 ); same as Shimea (4).  </li><li> A Benjamite, a descendant of Gibeon ( 1 Chronicles 8:32 ); called also Shimeam ( 9:38 ).   </li>
Shimei	<p>famous. </p><li> A son of Gershon, and grandson of Levi ( Numbers 3:18 ;  1 Chronicles 6:17 1 Chronicles 6:29 ); called Shimi in  Exodus 6:17 .  </li><li> A Benjamite of the house of Saul, who stoned and cursed David when he reached Bahurim in his flight from Jerusalem on the occasion of the rebellion of Absalom ( 2 Samuel 16:5-13 ). After the defeat of Absalom he "came cringing to the king, humbly suing for pardon, bringing with him a thousand of his Benjamite tribesmen, and representing that he was heartily sorry for his crime, and had hurried the first of all the house of Israel to offer homage to the king" ( 19:16-23 ). David forgave him; but on his death-bed he gave Solomon special instructions regarding Shimei, of whose fidelity he seems to have been in doubt ( 1 Kings 2:8 1 Kings 2:9 ). He was put to death at the command of Solomon, because he had violated his word by leaving Jerusalem and going to Gath to recover two of his servants who had escaped (36-46).  </li><li> One of David's mighty men who refused to acknowledge Adonijah as David's successor ( 1 Kings 1:8 ). He is probably the same person who is called elsewhere ( 4:18 ) "the son of Elah."  </li><li> A son of Pedaiah, the brother of Zerubbabel ( 1 Chronicles 3:19 ).  </li><li> A Simeonite ( 1 Chronicles 4:26 1 Chronicles 4:27 ).  </li><li> A Reubenite ( 1 Chronicles 5:4 ).  </li><li> A Levite of the family of Gershon ( 1 Chronicles 6:42 ).  </li><li> A Ramathite who was "over the vineyards" of David ( 1 Chronicles 27:27 ).  </li><li> One of the sons of Heman, who assisted in the purification of the temple ( 2 Chronicles 29:14 ).  </li><li> A Levite ( 2 Chronicles 31:12 2 Chronicles 31:13 ).  </li><li> Another Levite ( Ezra 10:23 ). "The family of Shimei" ( Zechariah 12:13 ; RSV, "the family of the Shimeites") were the descendants of Shimei (1).   </li>
Shimeon	<p>hearkening.  Ezra 10:31 .  </p>
Shimhi	<p>famous, a Benjamite ( 1 Chronicles 8:21 ).  </p>
Shimrath	<p>guardian, a Benjamite, one of Shimhi's sons (id.). </p>
Shimri	<p>watchman. </p><li> A Simeonite ( 1 Chronicles 4:37 ).  </li><li> The father of one of the "valiant men" of David's armies ( 1 Chronicles 11:45 ).  </li><li> Assisted at the purification of the temple in the time of Hezekiah ( 2 Chronicles 29:13 ).   </li>
Shimrom	<p>watchman, the fourth son of Issachar ( Genesis 46:13 ;  1 Chronicles 7:1 ; RSV, correctly, "Shimron").  </p>
Shimron	<p>watch-post, an ancient city of the Canaanites; with its villages, allotted to Zebulun ( Joshua 19:15 ); now probably Semunieh, on the northern edge of the plain of Esdraelon, 5 miles west of Nazareth.  </p>
Shimron-meron	<p>the same, probably, as Shimron ( Joshua 12:20 ).  </p>
Shimshai	<p>the shining one, or sunny, the secretary of Rehum the chancellor, who took part in opposing the rebuilding of the temple after the Captivity ( Ezra 4:8 Ezra 4:9 Ezra 4:17-23 ).  </p>
Shinab	<p>cooling, the king of Adamah, in the valley of Siddim, who with his confederates was conquered by Chedorlaomer ( Genesis 14:2 ).  </p>
Shinar, The Land of	<p>LXX. and Vulgate "Senaar;" in the inscriptions, "Shumir;" probably identical with Babylonia or Southern Mesopotamia, extending almost to the Persian Gulf. Here the tower of Babel was built ( Genesis 11:1-6 ), and the city of Babylon. The name occurs later in Jewish history ( Isaiah 11:11 ;  Zechariah 5:11 ). Shinar was apparently first peopled by Turanian tribes, who tilled the land and made bricks and built cities. Then tribes of Semites invaded the land and settled in it, and became its rulers. This was followed in course of time by an Elamite invasion; from which the land was finally delivered by Khammurabi, the son of Amarpel ("Amraphel, king of Shinar,"  Genesis 14:1 ), who became the founder of the new empire of Chaldea. (See AMRAPHEL .) </p>
Shiphmite	<p>probably the designation of Zabdi, who has charge of David's vineyards ( 1 Chronicles 27:27 ).  </p>
Shiphrah	<p>beauty, one of the Egyptian midwives ( Exodus 1:15 ).  </p>
Shiphtan	<p>judicial, an Ephraimite prince at the time of the division of Canaan ( Numbers 34:24 ).  </p>
Ships	<p>early used in foreign commerce by the Phoenicians ( Genesis 49:13 ). Moses ( Deuteronomy 28:68 ) and ( Job 9:26 ) make reference to them, and Balaam speaks of the "ships of Chittim" ( Numbers 24:24 ). Solomon constructed a navy at Ezion-geber by the assistance of Hiram's sailors ( 1 Kings 9:26-28 ;  2 Chr  8:18 ). Afterwards, Jehoshaphat sought to provide himself with a navy at the same port, but his ships appear to have been wrecked before they set sail ( 1 Kings 22:48 1 Kings 22:49 ;  2 Chr  20:35-37 ).  </p><p> In our Lord's time fishermen's boats on the Sea of Galilee were called "ships." Much may be learned regarding the construction of ancient merchant ships and navigation from the record in  Acts 2728 ,28.  </p>
Shishak I	<p>=Sheshonk I., king of Egypt. His reign was one of great national success, and a record of his wars and conquests adorns the portico of what are called the "Bubastite kings" at Karnak, the ancient Thebes. Among these conquests is a record of that of Judea. In the fifth year of Rehoboam's reign Shishak came up against the kingdom of Judah with a powerful army. He took the fenced cities and came to Jerusalem. He pillaged the treasures of the temple and of the royal palace, and carried away the shields of gold which Solomon had made ( 1 Kings 11:40 ;  14:25 ;  2 Chr  12:2 ). (See REHOBOAM .) This expedition of the Egyptian king was undertaken at the instigation of Jeroboam for the purpose of humbling Judah. Hostilities between the two kingdoms still continued; but during Rehoboam's reign there was not again the intervention of a third party. </p>
Shittah-tree	<p>( Isaiah 41:19 ; RSV, "acacia tree"). Shittah wood was employed in making the various parts of the tabernacle in the wilderness, and must therefore have been indigenous in the desert in which the Israelites wandered. It was the acacia or mimosa (Acacia Nilotica and A. seyal). "The wild acacia (Mimosa Nilotica), under the name of <i> sunt</i> , everywhere represents the seneh, or senna, of the burning bush. A slightly different form of the tree, equally common under the name of <i> seyal</i> , is the ancient 'shittah,' or, as more usually expressed in the plural form, the 'shittim,' of which the tabernacle was made." Stanley's Sinai, etc. ( Exodus 25:10 Exodus 25:13 Exodus 25:23 Exodus 25:28 ).  </p>
Shittim	<p>acacias, also called "Abel-shittim" ( Numbers 33:49 ), a plain or valley in the land of Moab where the Israelites were encamped after their two victories over Sihon and Og, at the close of their desert wanderings, and from which Joshua sent forth two spies (q.v.) "secretly" to "view" the land and Jericho ( Joshua 2:1 ).  </p>
Shoa	<p>opulent, the mountain district lying to the north-east of Babylonia, anciently the land of the Guti, or Kuti, the modern Kurdistan. The plain lying between these mountains and the Tigris was called su-Edina, i.e., "the border of the plain." This name was sometimes shortened into Suti and Su, and has been regarded as = Shoa ( Ezekiel 23:23 ). Some think it denotes a place in Babylon. (See PEKOD .) </p>
Shobab	<p>apostate. </p><li> One of David's sons by Bathseheba ( 2 Samuel 5:14 ).  </li><li> One of the sons of Caleb ( 1 Chronicles 2:18 ), the son of Hezron.   </li>
Shobach	<p>poured out, the "captain of the host of Hadarezer" when he mustered his vassals and tributaries from beyond "the river Euphrates" ( 2 Samuel 10:15-18 ); called also Shophach ( 1 Chronicles 19:16 ).  </p>
Shobai	<p>captors ( Ezra 2:42 ).  </p>
Shobal	<p>pilgrim. </p><li> The second son of Seir the Horite; one of the Horite "dukes" ( Genesis 36:20 ).  </li><li> One of the sons of Caleb, and a descendant of Hur ( 1 Chronicles 2:50 1 Chronicles 2:52 ;  1 Chronicles 4:1 1 Chronicles 4:2 ).   </li>
Shobi	<p>captor, son of Nahash of Rabbah, the Ammonite. He showed kindness to David when he fled from Jerusalem to Mahanaim ( 2 Samuel 17:27 ).  </p>
Shocho	<p>( 2 Chronicles 28:18 ) = Shochoh ( 1 Samuel 17:1 ) = Shoco ( 2 Chronicles 11:7 ). See SOCOH . </p>
Shoe	<p>Of various forms, from the mere sandal (q.v.) to the complete covering of the foot. The word so rendered (A.V.) in  Deuteronomy 33:25 , <i> min'al</i> , "a bar," is derived from a root meaning "to bolt" or "shut fast," and hence a fastness or fortress. The verse has accordingly been rendered "iron and brass shall be thy fortress," or, as in the Revised Version, "thy bars [marg., "shoes"] shall be iron and brass." </p>
Shomer	<p>watchman. </p><li> The mother of Jehozabad, who murdered Joash ( 2 Kings 12:21 ); called also Shimrith, a Moabitess ( 2 Chronicles 24:26 ).  </li><li> A man of Asher ( 1 Chronicles 7:32 ); called also Shamer (34).   </li>
Shophan	<p>hidden, or hollow, a town east of Jordan ( Numbers 32:35 ), built by the children of Gad. This word should probably be joined with the word preceding it in this passage, Atroth-Shophan, as in the Revised Version.  </p>
Shoshannim	<p>lilies, the name of some musical instrument, probably like a lily in shape ( Psalms 45 ;  69 , title). Some think that an instrument of six strings is meant.  </p>
Shoshannim-Eduth	<p>in title of  Psalms 80  (RSV marg., "lilies, a testimony"), probably the name of the melody to which the psalm was to be sung.  </p>
Shrines, Silver	<p>little models and medallions of the temple and image of Diana of Ephesus ( Acts 19:24 ). The manufacture of these was a very large and profitable business.  </p>
Shua	<p>wealth. </p><li> A Canaanite whose daughter was married to Judah ( 1 Chronicles 2:3 ).  </li><li> A daughter of Heber the Asherite ( 1 Chronicles 7:32 ).   </li>
Shuah	<p>prostration; a pit. </p><li> One of Abraham's sons by Keturah ( Genesis 25:2 ; Chr  1:32 ). </li><li> 1 Chronicles 4:11 .   </li>
Shual, The land of	<p>land of the fox, a district in the tribe of Benjamin ( 1 Samuel 13:17 ); possibly the same as Shalim ( 9:4 ), in the neighbourhood of Shaalabbin ( Joshua 19:42 ).  </p>
Shuhite	<p>a designation of Bildad ( Job 2:11 ), probably because he was a descendant of Shuah.  </p>
Shulamite	<p>the same, as some think, with "Shunammite," from "Shunem:" otherwise, the import of the word is uncertain (Cant  6:13 ; RSV, "Shulammite").  </p>
Shunammite	<p>a person of Shunem ( 1 Kings 1:3 ;  2 Kings  4:12 ). The Syr. and Arab. read "Sulamite."  </p>
Shunem	<p>two resting-places, a little village in the tribe of Issachar, to the north of Jezreel and south of Mount Gilboa ( Joshua 19:18 ), where the Philistines encamped when they came against Saul ( 1 Samuel 28:4 ), and where Elisha was hospitably entertained by a rich woman of the place. On the sudden death of this woman's son she hastened to Carmel, 20 miles distant across the plain, to tell Elisha, and to bring him with her to Shunem. There, in the "prophet's chamber," the dead child lay; and Elisha entering it, shut the door and prayed earnestly: and the boy was restored to life ( 2 Kings 4:8-37 ). This woman afterwards retired during the famine to the low land of the Philistines; and on returning a few years afterwards, found her house and fields in the possession of a stranger. She appealed to the king at Samaria, and had them in a somewhat remarkable manner restored to her (Compare  2 Kings 8:1-6 ).  </p>
Shur	<p>an enclosure; a wall, a part, probably, of the Arabian desert, on the north-eastern border of Egypt, giving its name to a wilderness extending from Egypt toward Philistia ( Genesis 16:7 ;  20:1 ;  25:18 ; Ex.15:22). The name was probably given to it from the wall (or shur) which the Egyptians built to defend their frontier on the north-east from the desert tribes. This wall or line of fortifications extended from Pelusium to Heliopolis.  </p>
Shushan	<p>a lily, the Susa of Greek and Roman writers, once the capital of Elam. It lay in the uplands of Susiana, on the east of the Tigris, about 150 miles to the north of the head of the Persian Gulf. It is the modern Shush, on the northwest of Shuster. Once a magnificent city, it is now an immense mass of ruins. Here Daniel saw one of his visions ( Daniel 8 ); and here also Nehemiah (Neh. 1) began his public life. Most of the events recorded in the Book of Esther took place here. Modern explorers have brought to light numerous relics, and the ground-plan of the splendid palace of Shushan, one of the residences of the great king, together with numerous specimens of ancient art, which illustrate the statements of Scripture regarding it ( Daniel 8:2 ). The great hall of this palace (Esther 1) "consisted of several magnificent groups of columns, together with a frontage of 343 feet 9 inches, and a depth of 244 feet. These groups were arranged into a central phalanx of thirty-six columns (six rows of six each), flanked on the west, north, and east by an equal number, disposed in double rows of six each, and distant from them 64 feet 2 inches." The inscriptions on the ruins represent that the palace was founded by Darius and completed by Artaxerxes.  </p>
Shushan-Eduth	<p>lily of the testimony, the title of  Psalms 60 . (See SHOSHANNIM .) </p>
Sibbecai	<p>the Lord sustains, one of David's heroes ( 1 Chronicles 11:29 ), general of the eighth division of the army ( 27:11 ). He slew the giant Saph in the battle of Gob ( 2 Samuel 21:18 ; RSV, "Sibbechai"). Called also Mebunnai ( 23:27 ).  </p>
Sibmah	<p>coolness; fragrance, a town in Reuben, in the territory of Moab, on the east of Jordan ( Joshua 13:19 ); called also Shebam and Shibmah ( Numbers 32:3 Numbers 32:38 ). It was famous for its vines ( Isaiah 16:9 ;  Jeremiah 48:32 ). It has been identified with the ruin of Sumieh, where there are rock-cut wine-presses. This fact explains the words of the prophets referred to above. It was about 5 miles east of Heshbon.  </p>
Sichem	<p>=She'chem, (q.v.),  Genesis 12:6 .  </p>
Sickle	<p>of the Egyptians resembled that in modern use. The ears of corn were cut with it near the top of the straw. There was also a sickle used for warlike purposes, more correctly, however, called a pruning-hook ( Deuteronomy 16:9 ;  Jeremiah 50:16 , marg., "scythe;"  Joel 3:13 ;  Mark 4:29 ).  </p>
Siddim, Vale of	<p>valley of the broad plains, "which is the salt sea" ( Genesis 14:3 Genesis 14:8 Genesis 14:10 ), between Engedi and the cities of the plain, at the south end of the Dead Sea. It was "full of slime-pits" (RSV, "bitumen pits"). Here Chedorlaomer and the confederate kings overthrew the kings of Sodom and the cities of the plain. God afterwards, on account of their wickedness, "overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities;" and the smoke of their destruction "went up as the smoke of a furnace" ( 19:24-28 ), and was visible from Mamre, where Abraham dwelt.  </p><p> Some, however, contend that the "cities of the plain" were somewhere at the north of the Dead Sea. (See SODOM .) </p>
Sidon	<p>fishing; fishery, Gen 10:15,19(A.V. marg., Tzidon; RSV, Zidon);  Matthew 11:21 Matthew 11:22 ;  Luke 6:17 . (See ZIDON .) </p>
Signet	<p>a seal used to attest documents ( Daniel 6:8-10 Daniel 6:12 ). In  6:17 , this word properly denotes a ring. The impression of a signet ring on fine clay has recently been discovered among the ruins at Nineveh. It bears the name and title of an Egyptian king. Two actual signet rings of ancient Egyptian monarchs (Cheops and Horus) have also been discovered.  </p><p> When digging a shaft close to the south wall of the temple area, the engineers of the Palestine Exploration Fund, at a depth of 12 feet below the surface, came upon a pavement of polished stones, formerly one of the streets of the city. Under this pavement they found a stratum of 16 feet of concrete, and among this concrete, 10 feet down, they found a signet stone bearing the inscription, in Old Hebrew characters, "Haggai, son of Shebaniah." It has been asked, Might not this be the actual seal of Haggai the prophet? We know that he was in Jerusalem after the Captivity; and it is somewhat singular that he alone of all the minor prophets makes mention of a signet ( Haggai 2:23 ). (See SEAL .) </p>
Sihon	<p>striking down. The whole country on the east of Jordan, from the Arnon to the Jabbok, was possessed by the Amorites, whose king, Sihon, refused to permit the Israelites to pass through his territory, and put his army in array against them. The Israelites went forth against him to battle, and gained a complete victory. The Amorites were defeated; Sihon, his sons, and all his people were smitten with the sword, his walled towns were captured, and the entire country of the Amorites was taken possession of by the Israelites ( Numbers 21:21-30 ;  Deuteronomy 2:24-37 ).  </p><p> The country from the Jabbok to Hermon was at this time ruled by Og, the last of the Rephaim. He also tried to prevent the progress of the Israelites, but was utterly routed, and all his cities and territory fell into the hands of the Israelites (Compare  Numbers 21:33-35 ;  Deuteronomy 3:1-14 ;  Psalms 135: :  1012 -12;  136:17-22 ).  </p><p> These two victories gave the Israelites possession of the country on the east of Jordan, from the Arnon to the foot of Hermon. The kingdom of Sihon embraced about 1,500 square miles, while that of Og was more than 3,000 square miles.  </p>
Sihor	<p>(correctly Shi'hor) black; dark the name given to the river Nile in  Isaiah 23:3 ;  Jeremiah 2:18 . In  Joshua 13:3  it is probably "the river of Egypt", i.e., the Wady el-Arish ( 1 Chronicles 13:5 ), which flows "before Egypt", i.e., in a north-easterly direction from Egypt, and enters the sea about 50 miles south-west of Gaza.  </p>
Silas	<p>wood, a prominent member of the church at Jerusalem; also called Silvanus. He and Judas, surnamed Barsabas, were chosen by the church there to accompany Paul and Barnabas on their return to Antioch from the council of the apostles and elders ( Acts 15:22 ), as bearers of the decree adopted by the council. He assisted Paul there in his evangelistic labours, and was also chosen by him to be his companion on his second missionary tour ( Acts 16:19-24 ). He is referred to in the epistles under the name of Silvanus ( 2 Corinthians 1:19 ;  1 Thessalonians 1:1 ;  2 th  1:1 ;  1 Peter 5:12 ). There is no record of the time or place of his death.  </p>
Silk	<p>Heb. demeshek, "damask," silk cloth manufactured at Damascus,  Amos 3:12 . A.V., "in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus in a couch;" RSV, "in the corner of a couch, and on the silken cushions of a bed" (marg., "in Damascus on a bed").  </p><p> Heb. meshi, ( Ezekiel 16:10 Ezekiel 16:13 , rendered "silk"). In  Genesis 41:42  (marg. A.V.),  Proverbs 31:22  (RSV, "fine linen"), the word "silk" ought to be "fine linen."  </p><p> Silk was common in New Testament times ( Revelation 18:12 ).  </p>
Silla	<p>a highway; a twig, only in  2 Kings 12:20 . If taken as a proper name (as in the LXX. and other versions), the locality is unknown.  </p>
Siloah, The pool of	<p>Heb. shelah; i.e., "the dart",  Nehemiah 3:15 ; with the art. <i> shiloah</i> , "sending,"  Isaiah 8:6  (comp 7:3)=Siloam (q.v.)  </p>
Siloam, Pool of	<p>sent or sending. Here a notable miracle was wrought by our Lord in giving sight to the blind ( John 9:7-11 ). It has been identified with the Birket Silwan in the lower Tyropoeon valley, to the south-east of the hill of Zion.  </p><p> The water which flows into this pool intermittingly by a subterranean channel springs from the "Fountain of the Virgin" (q.v.). The length of this channel, which has several windings, is 1,750 feet, though the direct distance is only 1,100 feet. The pool is 53 feet in length from north to south, 18 feet wide, and 19 deep. The water passes from it by a channel cut in the rock into the gardens below. (See EN-ROGEL.)  </p><p> Many years ago (1880) a youth, while wading up the conduit by which the water enters the pool, accidentally discovered an inscription cut in the rock, on the eastern side, about 19 feet from the pool. This is the oldest extant Hebrew record of the kind. It has with great care been deciphered by scholars, and has been found to be an account of the manner in which the tunnel was constructed. Its whole length is said to be "twelve hundred cubits;" and the inscription further notes that the workmen, like the excavators of the Mont Cenis Tunnel, excavated from both ends, meeting in the middle.  </p><p> Some have argued that the inscription was cut in the time of Solomon; others, with more probability, refer it to the reign of Hezekiah. A more ancient tunnel was discovered in 1889 some 20 feet below the ground. It is of smaller dimensions, but more direct in its course. It is to this tunnel that ( Isaiah 8:6 ) probably refers.  </p><p> The Siloam inscription above referred to was surreptitiously cut from the wall of the tunnel in 1891 and broken into fragments. These were, however, recovered by the efforts of the British Consul at Jerusalem, and have been restored to their original place.  </p>
Siloam, Tower of	<p>mentioned only  Luke 13:4 . The place here spoken of is the village now called Silwan, or Kefr Silwan, on the east of the valley of Kidron, and to the north-east of the pool. It stands on the west slope of the Mount of Olives.  </p><p> As illustrative of the movement of small bands of Canaanites from place to place, and the intermingling of Canaanites and Israelites even in small towns in earlier times, M.C. Ganneau records the following curious fact: "Among the inhabitants of the village (of Siloam) there are a hundred or so domiciled for the most part in the lower quarter, and forming a group apart from the rest, called Dhiabrye, i.e., men of Dhiban. It appears that at some remote period a colony from the capital of king Mesha (Dibon-Moab) crossed the Jordan and fixed itself at the gates of Jerusalem at Silwan. The memory of this migration is still preserved; and I am assured by the people themselves that many of their number are installed in other villages round Jerusalem" (quoted by Henderson, Palestine). </p>
Silver	<p>used for a great variety of purposes, as may be judged from the frequent references to it in Scripture. It first appears in commerce in  Genesis 13:2 ;  Genesis 23:15 Genesis 23:16 . It was largely employed for making vessels for the sanctuary in the wilderness ( Exodus 26:19 ;  27:17 ;  Numbers 7:13 Numbers 7:19 ;  10:2 ). There is no record of its having been found in Syria or Palestine. It was brought in large quantities by foreign merchants from abroad, from Spain and India and other countries probably.  </p>
Silverling	<p>( Isaiah 7:23 ). Literally the words are "at a thousand of silver", i.e., "pieces of silver," or shekels.  </p>
Simeon	<p>hearing. </p><li> The second son of Jacob by Leah ( Genesis 29:33 ). He was associated with Levi in the terrible act of vengeance against Hamor and the Shechemites ( Genesis 34:25 Genesis 34:26 ). He was detained by Joseph in Egypt as a hostage ( 42:24 ). His father, when dying, pronounced a malediction against him ( 49:5-7 ). The words in the Authorized Version ( 49:6 ), "they digged down a wall," ought to be, as correctly rendered in the Revised Version, "they houghed an ox."  </li><li> An aged saint who visited the temple when Jesus was being presented before the Lord, and uttered lofty words of thankgiving and of prophecy ( Luke 2:29-35 ).  </li><li> One of the ancestors of Joseph ( Luke 3:30 ).  </li><li> Surnamed Niger, i.e., "black," perhaps from his dark complexion, a teacher of some distinction in the church of Antioch ( Acts 13:1-3 ). It has been supposed that this was the Simon of Cyrene who bore Christ's cross. Note the number of nationalities represented in the church at Antioch.  </li><li> James ( Acts 15:14 ) thus designates the apostle Peter (q.v.).   </li>
Simeon, The tribe of	<p>was "divided and scattered" according to the prediction in  Genesis 49:5-7 . They gradually dwindled in number, and sank into a position of insignificance among the other tribes. They decreased in the wilderness by about two-thirds (Compare  Numbers 1:23 ;  26:14 ). Moses pronounces no blessing on this tribe. It is passed by in silence ( Deuteronomy 33 ).  </p><p> This tribe received as their portion a part of the territory already allotted to Judah ( Joshua 19:1-9 ). It lay in the south-west of the land, with Judah on the east and Dan on the north; but whether it was a compact territory or not cannot be determined. The subsequent notices of this tribe are but few ( 1 Chronicles 4:24-43 ). Like Reuben on the east of Jordan, this tribe had little influence on the history of Israel.  </p>
Simon	<p>the abbreviated form of Simeon. </p><li> One of the twelve apostles, called the Canaanite ( Matthew 10:4 ;  Mark 3:18 ). This word "Canaanite" does not mean a native of Canaan, but is derived from the Syriac word Kanean or Kaneniah, which was the name of a Jewish sect. The Revised Version has "Cananaean;" marg., "or Zealot" He is also called "Zelotes" ( Luke 6:15 ;  Acts 1:13 ; RSV, "the Zealot"), because previous to his call to the apostleship he had been a member of the fanatical sect of the Zealots. There is no record regarding him.  </li><li> The father of Judas Iscariot ( John 6:71 ;  John 13:2 John 13:26 ).  </li><li> One of the brothers of our Lord ( Matthew 13:55 ;  Mark 6:3 ).  </li><li> A Pharisee in whose house "a woman of the city which was a sinner" anointed our Lord's feet with ointment ( Luke 7:36-38 ).  </li><li> A leper of Bethany, in whose house Mary anointed our Lord's head with ointment "as he sat at meat" ( Matthew 26:6-13 ;  Mark 14:3-9 ).  </li><li> A Jew of Cyrene, in North Africa, then a province of Libya. A hundred thousand Jews from Palestine had been settled in this province by Ptolemy Soter (B.C. 323-285), where by this time they had greatly increased in number. They had a synagogue in Jerusalem for such of their number as went thither to the annual feasts. Simon was seized by the soldiers as the procession wended its way to the place of crucifixion as he was passing by, and the heavy cross which Christ from failing strength could no longer bear was laid on his shoulders. Perhaps they seized him because he showed sympathy with Jesus. He was the "father of Alexander and Rufus" ( Matthew 27:32 ). Possibly this Simon may have been one of the "men of Cyrene" who preached the word to the Greeks ( Acts 11:20 ).  </li><li> A sorcerer of great repute for his magical arts among the Samaritans ( Acts 8:9-11 ). He afterwards became a professed convert to the faith under the preaching of Philip the deacon and evangelist (12,13). His profession was, however, soon found to be hollow. His conduct called forth from Peter a stern rebuke ( 8:18-23 ). From this moment he disappears from the Church's history. The term "Simony," as denoting the purchase for money of spiritual offices, is derived from him.  </li><li> A Christian at Joppa, a tanner by trade, with whom Peter on one occasion lodged ( Acts 9:43 ).  </li><li> Simon Peter ( Matthew 4:18 ). See PETER .  </li>
Simri	<p>watchman, a Levite of the family of Merari ( 1 Chronicles 26:10 ).  </p>
Sin	<p>is "any want of conformity unto or transgression of the law of God" ( 1 John 3:4 ;  Romans 4:15 ), in the inward state and habit of the soul, as well as in the outward conduct of the life, whether by omission or commission ( Romans 6:12-17 ;  7:5-24 ). It is "not a mere violation of the law of our constitution, nor of the system of things, but an offence against a personal lawgiver and moral governor who vindicates his law with penalties. The soul that sins is always conscious that his sin is (1) intrinsically vile and polluting, and (2) that it justly deserves punishment, and calls down the righteous wrath of God. Hence sin carries with it two inalienable characters, (1) ill-desert, guilt (reatus); and (2) pollution (macula).", Hodge's Outlines.  </p><p> The moral character of a man's actions is determined by the moral state of his heart. The disposition to sin, or the habit of the soul that leads to the sinful act, is itself also sin ( Romans 6:12-17 ;  Galatians 5:17 ;  James 1:14 James 1:15 ).  </p><p> The origin of sin is a mystery, and must for ever remain such to us. It is plain that for some reason God has permitted sin to enter this world, and that is all we know. His permitting it, however, in no way makes God the author of sin. </p><p> Adam's sin ( Genesis 3:1-6 ) consisted in his yielding to the assaults of temptation and eating the forbidden fruit. It involved in it, (1) the sin of unbelief, virtually making God a liar; and (2) the guilt of disobedience to a positive command. By this sin he became an apostate from God, a rebel in arms against his Creator. He lost the favour of God and communion with him; his whole nature became depraved, and he incurred the penalty involved in the covenant of works.  </p><p> Original sin. "Our first parents being the root of all mankind, the guilt of their sin was imputed, and the same death in sin and corrupted nature were conveyed to all their posterity, descending from them by ordinary generation." Adam was constituted by God the federal head and representative of all his posterity, as he was also their natural head, and therefore when he fell they fell with him ( Romans 5:12-21 ;  1 Corinthians 15:22-45 ). His probation was their probation, and his fall their fall. Because of Adam's first sin all his posterity came into the world in a state of sin and condemnation, i.e., (1) a state of moral corruption, and (2) of guilt, as having judicially imputed to them the guilt of Adam's first sin.  </p><p> "Original sin" is frequently and properly used to denote only the moral corruption of their whole nature inherited by all men from Adam. This inherited moral corruption consists in, (1) the loss of original righteousness; and (2) the presence of a constant proneness to evil, which is the root and origin of all actual sin. It is called "sin" ( Romans 6:12 Romans 6:14 Romans 6:17 ;  7:5-17 ), the "flesh" ( Galatians 5:17 Galatians 5:24 ), "lust" ( James 1:14 James 1:15 ), the "body of sin" ( Romans 6:6 ), "ignorance," "blindness of heart," "alienation from the life of God" ( Ephesians 4:18 Ephesians 4:19 ). It influences and depraves the whole man, and its tendency is still downward to deeper and deeper corruption, there remaining no recuperative element in the soul. It is a total depravity, and it is also universally inherited by all the natural descendants of Adam ( Romans 3:10-23 ;  5:12-21 ;  8:7 ). Pelagians deny original sin, and regard man as by nature morally and spiritually well; semi-Pelagians regard him as morally sick; Augustinians, or, as they are also called, Calvinists, regard man as described above, spiritually dead ( Ephesians 2:1 ;  1 John 3:14 ).  </p><p> The doctrine of original sin is proved, </p><li> From the fact of the universal sinfulness of men. "There is no man that sinneth not" ( 1 Kings 8:46 ;  Isaiah 53:6 ;  Psalms 130:3 ;  Romans 3:19 Romans 3:22 Romans 3:23 ;  Galatians 3:22 ). </li><li> From the total depravity of man. All men are declared to be destitute of any principle of spiritual life; man's apostasy from God is total and complete ( Job 15:14-16 ;  Genesis 6:5 Genesis 6:6 ). </li><li> From its early manifestation ( Psalms 58:3 ;  Proverbs 22:15 ). </li><li> It is proved also from the necessity, absolutely and universally, of regeneration ( John 3:3 ;  2 co  5:17 ). </li><li> From the universality of death ( Romans 5:12-20 ).  <p> Various kinds of sin are mentioned, </p></li><li> "Presumptuous sins," or as literally rendered, "sins with an uplifted hand", i.e., defiant acts of sin, in contrast with "errors" or "inadvertencies" ( Psalms 19:13 ). </li><li> "Secret", i.e., hidden sins ( 19:12 ); sins which escape the notice of the soul. </li><li> "Sin against the Holy Ghost" (q.v.), or a "sin unto death" ( Matthew 12:31 Matthew 12:32 ;  1 John 5:16 ), which amounts to a wilful rejection of grace.  <p> Sin, a city in Egypt, called by the Greeks Pelusium, which means, as does also the Hebrew name, "clayey" or "muddy," so called from the abundance of clay found there. It is called by Ezekel ( Ezekiel 30:15 ) "the strength of Egypt, "thus denoting its importance as a fortified city. It has been identified with the modern Tineh, "a miry place," where its ruins are to be found. Of its boasted magnificence only four red granite columns remain, and some few fragments of others.  </p> </li>
Sin, Wilderness of	<p>lying between Elim and sinai ( Exodus 16:1 ; Compare  Numbers 33:11 Numbers 33:12 ). This was probably the narrow plain of el-Markha, which stretches along the eastern shore of the Red Sea for several miles toward the promontory of Ras Mohammed, the southern extremity of the Sinitic Peninsula. While the Israelites rested here for some days they began to murmur on account of the want of nourishment, as they had by this time consumed all the corn they had brought with them out of Egypt. God heard their murmurings, and gave them "manna" and then quails in abundance.  </p>
Sinai	<p>of Sin (the moon god), called also Horeb, the name of the mountain district which was reached by the Hebrews in the third month after the Exodus. Here they remained encamped for about a whole year. Their journey from the Red Sea to this encampment, including all the windings of the route, was about 150 miles. The last twenty-two chapters of Exodus, together with the whole of Leviticus and Nu ch. 1-11, contain a record of all the transactions which occurred while they were here. From Rephidim ( Exodus 17:8-13 ) the Israelites journeyed forward through the Wady Solaf and Wady esh-Sheikh into the plain of er-Rahah, "the desert of Sinai," about 2 miles long and half a mile broad, and encamped there "before the mountain." The part of the mountain range, a protruding lower bluff, known as the Ras Sasafeh (Sufsafeh), rises almost perpendicularly from this plain, and is in all probability the Sinai of history. Dean Stanley thus describes the scene:, "The plain itself is not broken and uneven and narrowly shut in, like almost all others in the range, but presents a long retiring sweep, within which the people could remove and stand afar off. The cliff, rising like a huge altar in front of the whole congregation, and visible against the sky in lonely grandeur from end to end of the whole plain, is the very image of the 'mount that might be touched,' and from which the voice of God might be heard far and wide over the plain below." This was the scene of the giving of the law. From the Ras Sufsafeh the law was proclaimed to the people encamped below in the plain of er-Rahah. During the lengthened period of their encampment here the Israelites passed through a very memorable experience. An immense change passed over them. They are now an organized nation, bound by covenant engagement to serve the Lord their God, their ever-present divine Leader and Protector. At length, in the second month of the second year of the Exodus, they move their camp and march forward according to a prescribed order. After three days they reach the "wilderness of Paran," the "et-Tih", i.e., "the desert", and here they make their first encampment. At this time a spirit of discontent broke out amongst them, and the Lord manifested his displeasure by a fire which fell on the encampment and inflicted injury on them. Moses called the place Taberah (q.v.),  Numbers 11:1-3 . The journey between Sinai and the southern boundary of the Promised Land (about 150 miles) at Kadesh was accomplished in about a year. (See MAP facing page 204.)  </p>
Sinaiticus codex	<p>usually designated by the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, is one of the most valuable of ancient MSS. of the Greek New Testament. On the occasion of a third visit to the convent of St. Catherine, on Mount Sinai, in 1859, it was discovered by Dr. Tischendorf. He had on a previous visit in 1844 obtained forty-three parchment leaves of the LXX., which he deposited in the university library of Leipsic, under the title of the Codex Frederico-Augustanus, after his royal patron the king of Saxony. In the year referred to (1859) the emperor of Russia sent him to prosecute his search for MSS., which he was convinced were still to be found in the Sinai convent. The story of his finding the manuscript of the New Testament has all the interest of a romance. He reached the convent on 31st January; but his inquiries appeared to be fruitless. On the 4th February he had resolved to return home without having gained his object. "On that day, when walking with the provisor of the convent, he spoke with much regret of his ill-success. Returning from their promenade, Tischendorf accompanied the monk to his room, and there had displayed to him what his companion called a copy of the LXX., which he, the ghostly brother, owned. The MS. was wrapped up in a piece of cloth, and on its being unrolled, to the surprise and delight of the critic the very document presented itself which he had given up all hope of seeing. His object had been to complete the fragmentary LXX. of 1844, which he had declared to be the most ancient of all Greek codices on vellum that are extant; but he found not only that, but a copy of the Greek New Testament attached, of the same age, and perfectly complete, not wanting a single page or paragraph." This precious fragment, after some negotiations, he obtained possession of, and conveyed it to the Emperor Alexander, who fully appreciated its importance, and caused it to be published as nearly as possible in facsimile, so as to exhibit correctly the ancient handwriting. The entire codex consists of 346 1/2 folios. Of these 199 belong to the Old Testament and 147 1/2 to the New, along with two ancient documents called the Epistle of Barnabas and the Shepherd of Hermas. The books of the New Testament stand thus: the four Gospels, the epistles of Paul, the Acts of the Apostles, the Catholic Epistles, the Apocalypse of John. It is shown by Tischendorf that this codex was written in the fourth century, and is thus of about the same age as the Vatican codex; but while the latter wants the greater part of Matthew and sundry leaves here and there besides, the Sinaiticus is the only copy of the New Testament in uncial characters which is complete. Thus it is the oldest extant MS. copy of the New Testament. Both the Vatican and the Sinai codices were probably written in Egypt. (See VATICANUS .) </p>
Sinim, The land of	<p>( Isaiah 49:12 ), supposed by some to mean China, but more probably Phoenicia ( Genesis 10:17 ) is intended.  </p>
Sinite	<p>an inhabitant of Sin, near Arka ( Genesis 10:17 ;  1 Chronicles 1:15 ). (See ARKITE .) </p>
Sin-offering	<p>(Heb. hattath), the law of, is given in detail in  Leviticus 4-6:13; ;  Leviticus 9:7-11 Leviticus 9:22-24 ;  12:6-8 ;  Leviticus 15:2 Leviticus 15:14 Leviticus 15:25-30 ;  Leviticus 14:19 Leviticus 14:31 ;  Numbers 6:10-14 . On the day of Atonement it was made with special solemnity ( Leviticus 16:5 Leviticus 16:11 Leviticus 16:15 ). The blood was then carried into the holy of holies and sprinkled on the mercy-seat. Sin-offerings were also presented at the five annual festivals ( Numbers 2829 ,29), and on the occasion of the consecration of the priests ( Exodus 29:10-14 Exodus 29:36 ). As each individual, even the most private member of the congregation, as well as the congregation at large, and the high priest, was obliged, on being convicted by his conscience of any particular sin, to come with a sin-offering, we see thus impressively disclosed the need in which every sinner stands of the salvation of Christ, and the necessity of making application to it as often as the guilt of sin renews itself upon his conscience. This resort of faith to the perfect sacrifice of Christ is the one way that lies open for the sinner's attainment of pardon and restoration to peace. And then in the sacrifice itself there is the reality of that incomparable worth and preciousness which were so significantly represented in the sin-offering by the sacredness of its blood and the hallowed destination of its flesh. With reference to this the blood of Christ is called emphatically "the precious blood," and the blood that "cleanseth from all sin" ( 1 John 1:7 ).  </p>
Sion	<p>elevated. </p><li> Denotes Mount Hermon in  Deuteronomy 4:48 ; called Sirion by the Sidonians, and by the Amorites Shenir ( Deuteronomy 3:9 ). (See HERMON .) </li><li> The Greek form of Zion (q.v.) in  Matthew 21:5 ;  John 12:15 .   </li>
Siphmoth	<p>fruitful places, some unknown place in the south, where David found friends when he fled from Saul ( 1 Samuel 30:28 ).  </p>
Sirah	<p>retiring, a well from which Joab's messenger brought back Abner ( 2 Samuel 3:26 ). It is now called 'Ain Sarah, and is situated about a mile from Hebron, on the road to the north.  </p>
Sirion	<p>a breastplate, the Sidonian name of Hermon (q.v.),  Deuteronomy 3:9 ;  Psalms 29:6 .  </p>
Sisera	<p>(Egypt. Ses-Ra, "servant of Ra"). </p><li> The captain of Jabin's army ( Judges 4:2 ), which was routed and destroyed by the army of Barak on the plain of Esdraelon. After all was lost he fled to the settlement of Heber the Kenite in the plain of Zaanaim. Jael, Heber's wife, received him into her tent with apparent hospitality, and "gave him butter" (i.e., lebben, or curdled milk) "in a lordly dish." Having drunk the refreshing beverage, he lay down, and soon sank into the sleep of the weary. While he lay asleep Jael crept stealthily up to him, and taking in her hand one of the tent pegs, with a mallet she drove it with such force through his temples that it entered into the ground where he lay, and "at her feet he bowed, he fell; where he bowed, there he fell down dead." The part of Deborah's song (Judg.  5:24-27 ) referring to the death of Sisera (which is a "mere patriotic outburst," and "is no proof that purer eyes would have failed to see gross sin mingling with Jael's service to Israel") is thus rendered by Professor Roberts (Old Testament Revision):  <p> "Extolled above women be Jael,  The wife of Heber the Kenite,  Extolled above women in the tent.  He asked for water, she gave him milk;  She brought him cream in a lordly dish.  She stretched forth her hand to the nail,  Her right hand to the workman's hammer,  And she smote Sisera; she crushed his head,  She crashed through and transfixed his temples.  At her feet he curled himself, he fell, he lay still;  At her feet he curled himself, he fell;  And where he curled himself, there he fell dead." </p></li><li> The ancestor of some of the Nethinim who returned with Zerubbabel ( Ezra 2:53 ;  Nehemiah 7:55 ).   </li>
Sitnah	<p>strife, the second of the two wells dug by Isaac, whose servants here contended with the Philistines ( Genesis 26:21 ). It has been identified with the modern Shutneh, in the valley of Gerar, to the west of Rehoboth, about 20 miles south of Beersheba.  </p>
Sitting	<p>the attitude generally assumed in Palestine by those who were engaged in any kind of work. "The carpenter saws, planes, and hews with his hand-adze, sitting on the ground or upon the plank he is planning. The washerwoman sits by the tub; and, in a word, no one stands when it is possible to sit. Shopkeepers always sit, and Levi sitting at the receipt of custom ( Matthew 9:9 ) is the exact way to state the case.", Thomson, Land and Book.  </p>
Sivan	<p>a Persian word (Assyr, sivanu, "bricks"), used after the Captivity as the name of the third month of the Jewish year, extending from the new moon in June to the new moon in July ( Esther 8:9 ).  </p>
Skin, Coats made of	<p>( Genesis 3:21 ). Skins of rams and badgers were used as a covering for the tabernacle ( Exodus 25:5 ;  Numbers 4:8-14 ).  </p>
Skull, The place of a	<p>See GOLGOTHA . </p>
Slave	<p> Jeremiah 2:14  (A.V.), but not there found in the original. In  Revelation 18:13  the word "slaves" is the rendering of a Greek word meaning "bodies." The Hebrew and Greek words for slave are usually rendered simply "servant," "bondman," or "bondservant." Slavery as it existed under the Mosaic law has no modern parallel. That law did not originate but only regulated the already existing custom of slavery ( Exodus 21:20 Exodus 21:21 Exodus 21:26 Exodus 21:27 ;  Leviticus 25:44-46 ;  Joshua 9:6-27 ). The gospel in its spirit and genius is hostile to slavery in every form, which under its influence is gradually disappearing from among men.  </p>
Slime	<p>( Genesis 11:3 ; LXX., "asphalt;" RSV marg., "bitumen"). The vale of Siddim was full of slime pits ( 14:10 ). Jochebed daubed the "ark of bulrushes" with slime ( Exodus 2:3 ). (See PITCH .) </p>
Sling	<p>With a sling and a stone David smote the Philistine giant ( 1 Samuel 17:40 1 Samuel 17:49 ). There were 700 Benjamites who were so skilled in its use that with the left hand they "could sling stones at a hair breadth, and not miss" ( Judges 20:16 ;  1 Chronicles 12:2 ). It was used by the Israelites in war ( 2 Kings 3:25 ). (See ARMS .) </p><p> The words in  Proverbs 26:8 , "As he that bindeth a stone in a sling," etc. (Authorized Version), should rather, as in the Revised Version, be "As a bag of gems in a heap of stones," etc.  </p>
Smith	<p>The Hebrews were not permitted by the Philistines in the days of Samuel to have a smith amongst them, lest they should make them swords and spears ( 1 Samuel 13:19 ). Thus the Philistines sought to make their conquest permanent (Compare  2 Kings 24:16 ).  </p>
Smyrna	<p>myrrh, an ancient city of Ionia, on the western coast of Asia Minor, about 40 miles to the north of Ephesus. It is now the chief city of Anatolia, having a mixed population of about 200,000, of whom about one-third are professed Christians. The church founded here was one of the seven addressed by our Lord ( Revelation 2:8-11 ). The celebrated Polycarp, a pupil of the apostle John, was in the second century a prominent leader in the church of Smyrna. Here he suffered martyrdom, A.D. 155.  </p>
Snail	<p></p><li> Heb. homit, among the unclean creeping things ( Leviticus 11:30 ). This was probably the sand-lizard, of which there are many species in the wilderness of Judea and the Sinai peninsula.  </li><li> Heb. shablul ( Psalms 58:8 ), the snail or slug proper. Tristram explains the allusions of this passage by a reference to the heat and drought by which the moisture of the snail is evaporated. "We find," he says, "in all parts of the Holy Land myriads of snail-shells in fissures still adhering by the calcareous exudation round their orifice to the surface of the rock, but the animal of which is utterly shrivelled and wasted, 'melted away.'"   </li>
Snare	<p>The expression ( Amos 3:5 ), "Shall one take up a snare from the earth?" etc. (Authorized Version), ought to be, as in the Revised Version, "Shall a snare spring up from the ground?" etc. (See GIN .) </p>
Snow	<p>Common in Palestine in winter ( Psalms 147:16 ). The snow on the tops of the Lebanon range is almost always within view throughout the whole year. The word is frequently used figuratively by the sacred writers ( Job 24:19 ;  Psalms 51:7 ;  68:14 ;  Isaiah 1:18 ). It is mentioned only once in the historical books ( 2 Samuel 23:20 ). It was "carried to Tyre, Sidon, and Damascus as a luxury, and labourers sweltering in the hot harvest-fields used it for the purpose of cooling the water which they drank ( Proverbs 25:13 ;  Jeremiah 18:14 ). No doubt Herod Antipas, at his feasts in Tiberias, enjoyed also from this very source the modern luxury of ice-water."  </p>
Soap	<p>( Jeremiah 2:22 ;  Malachi 3:2 ; Heb. borith), properly a vegetable alkali, obtained from the ashes of certain plants, particularly the salsola kali (saltwort), which abounds on the shores of the Dead Sea and of the Mediterranean. It does not appear that the Hebrews were acquainted with what is now called "soap," which is a compound of alkaline carbonates with oleaginous matter. The word "purely" in  Isaiah 1:25  (RSV, "throughly;" marg., "as with lye") is lit. "as with <i> bor</i> ." This word means "clearness," and hence also that which makes clear, or pure, alkali. "The ancients made use of alkali mingled with oil, instead of soap ( Job 9:30 ), and also in smelting metals, to make them melt and flow more readily and purely" (Gesenius).  </p>
Socho	<p>a fence; hedge, ( 1 Chronicles 4:18 ; RSV, Soco)=So'choh ( 1 Kings 4:10 ; RSV, Socoh), Sho'choh ( 1 Samuel 17:1 ; RSV, Socoh), Sho'co ( 2 Chronicles 11:7 ; RSV, Soco), Sho'cho ( 2 Chronicles 28:18 ; RSV, Soco), a city in the plain or lowland of Judah, where the Philistines encamped when they invaded Judah after their defeat at Michmash. It lay on the northern side of the valley of Elah (Wady es-Sunt). It has been identified with the modern Khurbet Shuweikeh, about 14 miles south-west of Jerusalem. In this campaign Goliath was slain, and the Philistines were completely routed.  </p>
Sodom	<p>burning; the walled, a city in the vale of Siddim ( Genesis 13:10 ;  14:1-16 ). The wickedness of its inhabitants brought down upon it fire from heaven, by which it was destroyed ( 18:16-33 ;  19:1-29 ;  Deuteronomy 23:17 ). This city and its awful destruction are frequently alluded to in Scripture ( Deuteronomy 29:23 ;  32:32 ;  Isaiah 1:9 Isaiah 1:10 ;  3:9 ;  13:19 ;  Jeremiah 23:14 ;  Ezekiel 16:46-56 ;  Zephaniah 2:9 ;  Matthew 10:15 ;  Romans 9:29 ;  2 Pet  2:6 , etc.). No trace of it or of the other cities of the plain has been discovered, so complete was their destruction. Just opposite the site of Zoar, on the south-west coast of the Dead Sea, is a range of low hills, forming a mass of mineral salt called Jebel Usdum, "the hill of Sodom." It has been concluded, from this and from other considerations, that the cities of the plain stood at the southern end of the Dead Sea. Others, however, with much greater probability, contend that they stood at the northern end of the sea. [in 1897].  </p>
Sodoma	<p>( Romans 9:29 ; RSV, "Sodom"), the Greek form for Sodom.  </p>
Sodomites	<p>those who imitated the licentious wickedness of Sodom ( Deuteronomy 23:17 ;  1 Kings 14:24 ;  Romans 1:26 Romans 1:27 ). Asa destroyed them "out of the land" ( 1 Kings 15:12 ), as did also his son Jehoshaphat ( 22:46 ).  </p>
Solemn meeting	<p>( Isaiah 1:13 ), the convocation on the eighth day of the Feast of Tabernacles ( Leviticus 23:36 ;  Numbers 29:35 , RSV, "solemn assembly;" marg., "closing festival"). It is the name given also to the convocation held on the seventh day of the Passover ( Deuteronomy 16:8 ).  </p>
Solomon	<p>peaceful, (Heb. Shelomoh), David's second son by Bathsheba, i.e., the first after their legal marriage ( 2 Samuel 12 ). He was probably born about B.C. 1035 ( 1 Chronicles 22:5 ;  29:1 ). He succeeded his father on the throne in early manhood, probably about sixteen or eighteen years of age. Nathan, to whom his education was intrusted, called him Jedidiah, i.e., "beloved of the Lord" ( 2 Samuel 12:24 2 Samuel 12:25 ). He was the first king of Israel "born in the purple." His father chose him as his successor, passing over the claims of his elder sons: "Assuredly Solomon my son shall reign after me." His history is recorded in 1Kings 1-11 and 2Chr. 1-9. His elevation to the throne took place before his father's death, and was hastened on mainly by Nathan and Bathsheba, in consequence of the rebellion of Adonijah ( 1 Kings 1:5-40 ). During his long reign of forty years the Hebrew monarchy gained its highest splendour. This period has well been called the "Augustan age" of the Jewish annals. The first half of his reign was, however, by far the brighter and more prosperous; the latter half was clouded by the idolatries into which he fell, mainly from his heathen intermarriages ( 1 Kings 11:1-8 ;  1 Kings 14:21 1 Kings 14:31 ).  </p><p> Before his death David gave parting instructions to his son ( 1 Kings 2:1-9 ;  1 Chronicles 22:7-16 ;  28 ). As soon as he had settled himself in his kingdom, and arranged the affairs of his extensive empire, he entered into an alliance with Egypt by the marriage of the daughter of Pharaoh ( 1 Kings 3:1 ), of whom, however, nothing further is recorded. He surrounded himself with all the luxuries and the external grandeur of an Eastern monarch, and his government prospered. He entered into an alliance with Hiram, king of Tyre, who in many ways greatly assisted him in his numerous undertakings. (See HIRAM .) </p><p> For some years before his death David was engaged in the active work of collecting materials ( 1 Chronicles 29:6-9 ;  2 Chr.  2:3-7 ) for building a temple in Jerusalem as a permanent abode for the ark of the covenant. He was not permitted to build the house of God ( 1 Chronicles 22:8 ); that honour was reserved to his son Solomon. (See TEMPLE .) </p><p> After the completion of the temple, Solomon engaged in the erection of many other buildings of importance in Jerusalem and in other parts of his kingdom. For the long space of thirteen years he was engaged in the erection of a royal palace on Ophel ( 1 Kings 7:1-12 ). It was 100 cubits long, 50 broad, and 30 high. Its lofty roof was supported by forty-five cedar pillars, so that the hall was like a forest of cedar wood, and hence probably it received the name of "The House of the Forest of Lebanon." In front of this "house" was another building, which was called the Porch of Pillars, and in front of this again was the "Hall of Judgment," or Throne-room ( 1 Kings 7:7 ;  10:18-20 ;  2 Chr  9:17-19 ), "the King's Gate," where he administered justice and gave audience to his people. This palace was a building of great magnificence and beauty. A portion of it was set apart as the residence of the queen consort, the daughter of Pharaoh. From the palace there was a private staircase of red and scented sandal wood which led up to the temple.  </p><p> Solomon also constructed great works for the purpose of securing a plentiful supply of water for the city (Eccl  2:4-6 ). He then built Millo (LXX., "Acra") for the defence of the city, completing a line of ramparts around it ( 1 Kings 9:15 1 Kings 9:24 ;  11:27 ). He erected also many other fortifications for the defence of his kingdom at various points where it was exposed to the assault of enemies ( 1 Kings 9:15-19 ;  2 Chr  8:2-6 ). Among his great undertakings must also be mentioned the building of Tadmor (q.v.) in the wilderness as a commercial depot, as well as a military outpost.  </p><p> During his reign Palestine enjoyed great commercial prosperity. Extensive traffic was carried on by land with Tyre and Egypt and Arabia, and by sea with Spain and India and the coasts of Africa, by which Solomon accumulated vast stores of wealth and of the produce of all nations ( 1 Kings 9:26-28 ;  1 Kings 10:11 1 Kings 10:12 ;  2 Chr  1 Kings 8:17 1 Kings 8:18 ;  9:21 ). This was the "golden age" of Israel. The royal magnificence and splendour of Solomon's court were unrivalled. He had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines, an evidence at once of his pride, his wealth, and his sensuality. The maintenance of his household involved immense expenditure. The provision required for one day was "thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal, ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallow-deer, and fatted fowl" ( 1 Kings 4:22 1 Kings 4:23 ).  </p><p> Solomon's reign was not only a period of great material prosperity, but was equally remarkable for its intellectual activity. He was the leader of his people also in this uprising amongst them of new intellectual life. "He spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five. And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes" ( 1 Kings 4:32 1 Kings 4:33 ).  </p><p> His fame was spread abroad through all lands, and men came from far and near "to hear the wisdom of Solomon." Among others thus attracted to Jerusalem was "the queen of the south" ( Matthew 12:42 ), the queen of Sheba, a country in Arabia Felix. "Deep, indeed, must have been her yearning, and great his fame, which induced a secluded Arabian queen to break through the immemorial custom of her dreamy land, and to put forth the energy required for braving the burdens and perils of so long a journey across a wilderness. Yet this she undertook, and carried it out with safety." ( 1 Kings 10:1-13 ;  2 Chr  9:1-12 .) She was filled with amazement by all she saw and heard: "there was no more spirit in her." After an interchange of presents she returned to her native land.  </p><p> But that golden age of Jewish history passed away. The bright day of Solomon's glory ended in clouds and darkness. His decline and fall from his high estate is a sad record. Chief among the causes of his decline were his polygamy and his great wealth. "As he grew older he spent more of his time among his favourites. The idle king living among these idle women, for 1,000 women, with all their idle and mischievous attendants, filled the palaces and pleasure-houses which he had built ( 1 Kings 11:3 ), learned first to tolerate and then to imitate their heathenish ways. He did not, indeed, cease to believe in the God of Israel with his mind. He did not cease to offer the usual sacrifices in the temple at the great feasts. But his heart was not right with God; his worship became merely formal; his soul, left empty by the dying out of true religious fervour, sought to be filled with any religious excitement which offered itself. Now for the first time a worship was publicly set up amongst the people of the Lord which was not simply irregular or forbidden, like that of Gideon ( Judges 8:27 ), or the Danites ( Judges 18:30 Judges 18:31 ), but was downright idolatrous." ( 1 Kings 11:7 ;  2 Kings  <span class="badLink">23:13</span> .)  </p><p> This brought upon him the divine displeasure. His enemies prevailed against him ( 1 Kings 11:14-22 1 Kings 11:23-25 1 Kings 11:26-40 ), and one judgment after another fell upon the land. And now the end of all came, and he died, after a reign of forty years, and was buried in the city of David, and "with him was buried the short-lived glory and unity of Israel." "He leaves behind him but one weak and worthless son, to dismember his kingdom and disgrace his name."  </p><p> "The kingdom of Solomon," says Rawlinson, "is one of the most striking facts in the Biblical history. A petty nation, which for hundreds of years has with difficulty maintained a separate existence in the midst of warlike tribes, each of which has in turn exercised dominion over it and oppressed it, is suddenly raised by the genius of a soldier-monarch to glory and greatness. An empire is established which extends from the Euphrates to the borders of Egypt, a distance of 450 miles; and this empire, rapidly constructed, enters almost immediately on a period of peace which lasts for half a century. Wealth, grandeur, architectural magnificence, artistic excellence, commercial enterprise, a position of dignity among the great nations of the earth, are enjoyed during this space, at the end of which there is a sudden collapse. The ruling nation is split in twain, the subject-races fall off, the pre-eminence lately gained being wholly lost, the scene of struggle, strife, oppression, recovery, inglorious submission, and desperate effort, re-commences.", Historical Illustrations.  </p>
Solomon, Song of	<p>called also, after the Vulgate, the "Canticles." It is the "song of songs" ( 1:1 ), as being the finest and most precious of its kind; the noblest song, "das Hohelied," as Luther calls it. The Solomonic authorship of this book has been called in question, but evidences, both internal and external, fairly establish the traditional view that it is the product of Solomon's pen. It is an allegorical poem setting forth the mutual love of Christ and the Church, under the emblem of the bridegroom and the bride. (Compare  Matthew 9:15 ;  John 3:29 ;  Ephesians 5:23 Ephesians 5:27 Ephesians 5:29 ;  Revelation 19:7-9 ;  Revelation 21:2 Revelation 21:9 ;  22:17 . Compare also  Psalms 45 ;  Isaiah 54:4-6 ;  Isaiah 62:4 Isaiah 62:5 ;  Jeremiah 2:2 ;  Jeremiah 3:1 Jeremiah 3:20 ; Ezek. 16;  Hosea 2:16 Hosea 2:19 Hosea 2:20 .)  </p>
Solomons Porch	<p>( John 10:23 ;  Acts 3:11 ;  5:12 ), a colonnade, or cloister probably, on the eastern side of the temple. It is not mentioned in connection with the first temple, but Josephus mentions a porch, so called, in Herod's temple (q.v.).  </p>
Son of God	<p>The plural, "sons of God," is used ( Genesis 6:2 Genesis 6:4 ) to denote the pious descendants of Seth. In  Job 1:6 ;  38:7  this name is applied to the angels. Hosea uses the phrase ( 1:10 ) to designate the gracious relation in which men stand to God.  </p><p> In the New Testament this phrase frequently denotes the relation into which we are brought to God by adoption ( Romans 8:14 Romans 8:19 ;  2 co  6:18 ;  Galatians 4:5 Galatians 4:6 ; Phil  2:15 ;  1 John 3:1 1 John 3:2 ). It occurs thirty-seven times in the New Testament as the distinctive title of our Saviour. He does not bear this title in consequence of his miraculous birth, nor of his incarnation, his resurrection, and exaltation to the Father's right hand. This is a title of nature and not of office. The sonship of Christ denotes his equality with the Father. To call Christ the Son of God is to assert his true and proper divinity. The second Person of the Trinity, because of his eternal relation to the first Person, is the Son of God. He is the Son of God as to his divine nature, while as to his human nature he is the Son of David ( Romans 1:3 Romans 1:4 . Compare  Galatians 4:4 ;  John 1:1-14 ;  5:18-25 ;  10:30-38 , which prove that Christ was the Son of God before his incarnation, and that his claim to this title is a claim of equality with God).  </p><p> When used with reference to creatures, whether men or angels, this word is always in the plural. In the singular it is always used of the second Person of the Trinity, with the single exception of  Luke 3:38 , where it is used of Adam.  </p>
Son of man	<p></p><li> Denotes mankind generally, with special reference to their weakness and frailty ( Job 25:6 ;  Psalms 8:4 ;  144:3 ;  146:3 ;  Isaiah 51:12 , etc.).  </li><li> It is a title frequently given to the prophet Ezekiel, probably to remind him of his human weakness.  </li><li> In the New Testament it is used forty-three times as a distinctive title of the Saviour. In the Old Testament it is used only in  Psalms 80:17  and  Daniel 7:13  with this application. It denotes the true humanity of our Lord. He had a true body ( Hebrews 2:14 ;  Luke 24:39 ) and a rational soul. He was perfect man.   </li>
Song of Solomon	<p>(Nubian, Sabako), an Ethiopian king who brought Egypt under his sway. He was bribed by Hoshea to help him against the Assyrian monarch Shalmaneser ( 2 Kings 17:4 ). This was a return to the policy that had been successful in the reign of Jeroboam I.  </p>
Songs	<p>of Moses ( Exodus 15 ;  Numbers 21:17 ;  Deuteronomy 32 ;  Revelation 15:3 ), Deborah (Judg. 5), Hannah ( 1 Samuel 2 ), David ( 2 Samuel 22 , and Psalms), Mary ( Luke 1:46-55 ), Zacharias ( Luke 1:68-79 ), the angels ( Luke 2:13 ), Simeon ( Luke 2:29 ), the redeemed ( Revelation 5:9 ;  19 ), Solomon (see SOLOMON, SONGS OF).  </p>
Soothsayer	<p>one who pretends to prognosticate future events. Baalam is so called ( Joshua 13:22 ; Heb. kosem, a "diviner," as rendered  1 Samuel 6:2 ; rendered "prudent,"  Isaiah 3:2 ). In  Isaiah 2:6  and  Micah 5:12  (Heb. yonenim, i.e., "diviners of the clouds") the word is used of the Chaldean diviners who studied the clouds. In  Daniel 2:27 ;  5:7  the word is the rendering of the Chaldee gazrin, i.e., "deciders" or "determiners", here applied to Chaldean astrologers, "who, by casting nativities from the place of the stars at one's birth, and by various arts of computing and divining, foretold the fortunes and destinies of individuals.", Gesenius, Lex. Heb. (See SORCERER .) </p>
Sop	<p>a morsel of bread ( John 13:26 ; Compare  Ruth 2:14 ). Our Lord took a piece of unleavened bread, and dipping it into the broth of bitter herbs at the Paschal meal, gave it to Judas. (Compare  Ruth 2:14 .)  </p>
Sopater	<p>the father who saves, probably the same as Sosipater, a kinsman of Paul ( Romans 16:21 ), a Christian of the city of Berea who accompanied Paul into Asia ( Acts 20:4-6 ).  </p>
Sorcerer	<p>from the Latin sortiarius, one who casts lots, or one who tells the lot of others. (See DIVINATION .) </p><p> In  Daniel 2:2  it is the rendering of the Hebrew mekhashphim, i.e., mutterers, men who professed to have power with evil spirits. The practice of sorcery exposed to severest punishment ( Malachi 3:5 ;  Revelation 21:8 ;  22:15 ).  </p>
Sorek	<p>choice vine, the name of a valley, i.e., a torrent-bed, now the Wady Surar, "valley of the fertile spot," which drains the western Judean hills, and flowing by Makkedah and Jabneel, falls into the sea some eight miles south of Joppa. This was the home of Deliah, whom Samson loved ( Judges 16:4 ).  </p>
Sosipater	<p>(See SOPATER .) </p>
Sosthenes	<p>safe in strength, the chief ruler of the synagogue at Corinth, who was seized and beaten by the mob in the presence of Gallio, the Roman governor, when he refused to proceed against Paul at the instigation of the Jews ( Acts 18:12-17 ). The motives of this assault against Sosthenes are not recorded, nor is it mentioned whether it was made by Greeks or Romans. Some identify him, but without sufficient grounds, with one whom Paul calls "Sosthenes our brother," a convert to the faith ( 1 Corinthians 1:1 ).  </p>
South	<p>Heb. Negeb, that arid district to the south of Palestine through which lay the caravan route from Central Palestine to Egypt ( Genesis 12:9 ;  Genesis 13:1 Genesis 13:3 ;  46:1-6 ). "The Negeb comprised a considerable but irregularly-shaped tract of country, its main portion stretching from the mountains and lowlands of Judah in the north to the mountains of Azazemeh in the south, and from the Dead Sea and southern Ghoron the east to the Mediterranean on the west." In  Ezekiel 20:46  ( (21:1  in Heb.) three different Hebrew words are all rendered "south." (1) "Set thy face toward the south" (Teman, the region on the right,  1 Samuel 33:24 ); (2) "Drop thy word toward the south" (Negeb, the region of dryness,  Joshua 15:4 ); (3) "Prophesy against the forest of the south field" (Darom, the region of brightness,  Deuteronomy 33:23 ). In  Job 37:9  the word "south" is literally "chamber," used here in the sense of treasury (comp  38:22 ;  Psalms 135:7 ). This verse is rendered in the Revised Version "out of the chamber of the south."  </p>
Sovereignty	<p>of God, his absolute right to do all things according to his own good pleasure ( Daniel 4:25 Daniel 4:35 ;  Romans 9:15-23 ;  1 Timothy 6:15 ;  Revelation 4:11 ).  </p>
Spain	<p>Paul expresses his intention ( Romans 15:24 Romans 15:28 ) to visit Spain. There is, however, no evidence that he ever carried it into effect, although some think that he probably did so between his first and second imprisonment. (See TARSHISH .) </p>
Sparrow	<p>Mentioned among the offerings made by the very poor. Two sparrows were sold for a farthing ( Matthew 10:29 ), and five for two farthings ( Luke 12:6 ). The Hebrew word thus rendered is <i> tsippor</i> , which properly denotes the whole family of small birds which feed on grain ( Leviticus 14:4 ;  Psalms 84:3 ;  102:7 ). The Greek word of the New Testament is <i> strouthion</i> ( Matthew 10:29-31 ), which is thus correctly rendered.  </p>
Spicery	<p>Heb. nechoth, identified with the Arabic naka'at, the gum tragacanth, obtained from the astralagus, of which there are about twenty species found in Palestine. The tragacanth of commerce is obtained from the A. tragacantha. "The gum exudes plentifully under the heat of the sun on the leaves, thorns, and exteremity of the twigs." </p>
Spices	<p>aromatic substances, of which several are named in  Exodus 30 . They were used in the sacred anointing oil ( Exodus 25:6 ;  35:8 ;  1 Chronicles 9:29 ), and in embalming the dead ( 2 Chronicles 16:14 ;  Luke 23:56 ;  24:1 ;  John 19:39 John 19:40 ). Spices were stored by Hezekiah in his treasure-house ( 2 Kings 20:13 ;  Isaiah 39:2 ).  </p>
Spider	<p>The trust of the hypocrite is compared to the spider's web or house ( Job 8:14 ). It is said of the wicked by Isaiah that they "weave the spider's web" ( <span class="badLink">59:5</span> ), i.e., their works and designs are, like the spider's web, vain and useless. The Hebrew word here used is <i> 'akkabish</i> , "a swift weaver." </p><p> In  Proverbs 30:28  a different Hebrew word (semamith) is used. It is rendered in the Vulgate by stellio, and in the Revised Version by "lizard." It may, however, represent the spider, of which there are, it is said, about seven hundred species in Palestine.  </p>
Spies	<p>When the Israelites reached Kadesh for the first time, and were encamped there, Moses selected twelve spies from among the chiefs of the divisions of the tribes, and sent them forth to spy the land of Canaan ( Numbers 13 ), and to bring back to him a report of its actual condition. They at once proceeded on their important errand, and went through the land as far north as the district round Lake Merom. After about six weeks' absence they returned. Their report was very discouraging, and the people were greatly alarmed, and in a rebellious spirit proposed to elect a new leader and return to Egypt. Only two of the spies, Caleb and Joshua, showed themselves on this occasion stout-hearted and faithful. All their appeals and remonstrances were in vain. Moses announced that as a punishment for their rebellion they must now wander in the wilderness till a new generation should arise which would go up and posses the land. The spies had been forty days absent on their expedition, and for each day the Israelites were to be wanderers for a year in the desert. (See ESHCOL .) </p><p> Two spies were sent by Joshua "secretly" i.e., unknown to the people ( Joshua 2:1 ), "to view the land and Jericho" after the death of Moses, and just before the tribes under his leadership were about to cross the Jordan. They learned from Rahab (q.v.), in whose house they found a hiding-place, that terror had fallen on all the inhabitants of the land because of the great things they had heard that Jehovah had done for them ( Exodus 15:14-16 ; comp  23:27 ;  Deuteronomy 2:25 ;  11:25 ). As the result of their mission they reported: "Truly Jehovah hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us."  </p>
Spikenard	<p>(Heb. nerd), a much-valued perfume (Cant  1:12 ;  Deuteronomy 4:13 Deuteronomy 4:14 ). It was "very precious", i.e., very costly ( Mark 14:3 ;  John 12:3 John 12:5 ). It is the root of an Indian plant, the Nardostachys jatamansi, of the family of Valeriance, growing on the Himalaya mountains. It is distinguished by its having many hairy spikes shooting out from one root. It is called by the Arabs sunbul Hindi, "the Indian spike." In the New Testament this word is the rendering of the Greek nardos pistike. The margin of the Revised Version in these passages has "pistic nard," pistic being perhaps a local name. Some take it to mean genuine, and others liquid. The most probable opinion is that the word pistike designates the nard as genuine or faithfully prepared.  </p>
Spirit	<p>(Heb. ruah; Gr. pneuma), properly wind or breath. In  2 Thessalonians 2:8  it means "breath," and in Eccl  8:8  the vital principle in man. It also denotes the rational, immortal soul by which man is distinguished ( Acts 7:59 ;  1 Corinthians 5:5 ;  6:20 ;  7:34 ), and the soul in its separate state ( Hebrews 12:23 ), and hence also an apparition ( Job 4:15 ;  Luke 24:37 Luke 24:39 ), an angel ( Hebrews 1:14 ), and a demon ( Luke 4:36 ;  10:20 ). This word is used also metaphorically as denoting a tendency ( Zechariah 12:10 ;  Luke 13:11 ).  </p><p> In Rom 1:4,1Tim 3:16,2co  Romans 3:18 , it designates the divine nature.  </p>
Spirit, Holy	<p>See HOLY GHOST . </p>
Sponge	<p>occurs only in the narrative of the crucifixion ( Matthew 27:48 ;  Mark 15:36 ;  John 19:29 ). It is ranked as a zoophyte. It is found attached to rocks at the bottom of the sea.  </p>
Spouse	<p>(Cant  4:8-12 ;  Hosea 4:13 Hosea 4:14 ) may denote either husband or wife, but in the Scriptures it denotes only the latter.  </p>
Spring	<p>(Heb. 'ain, "the bright open source, the eye of the landscape"). To be carefully distinguished from "well" (q.v.). "Springs" mentioned in  Joshua 10:40  (Heb. 'ashdoth) should rather be "declivities" or "slopes" (RSV), i.e., the undulating ground lying between the lowlands (the shephelah) and the central range of hills.  </p>
Stachys	<p>spike; an ear of corn, a convert at Rome whom Paul salutes ( Romans 16:9 ).  </p>
Stacte	<p>(Heb. nataph), one of the components of the perfume which was offered on the golden altar ( Exodus 30:34 ; RSV marg., "opobalsamum"). The Hebrew word is from a root meaning "to distil," and it has been by some interpreted as distilled myrrh. Others regard it as the gum of the storax tree, or rather shrub, the Styrax officinale. "The Syrians value this gum highly, and use it medicinally as an emulcent in pectoral complaints, and also in perfumery."  </p>
Star, Morning	<p>a name figuratively given to Christ ( Revelation 22:16 ; Compare  2 Peter 1:19 ). When Christ promises that he will give the "morning star" to his faithful ones, he "promises that he will give to them himself, that he will give to them himself, that he will impart to them his own glory and a share in his own royal dominion; for the star is evermore the symbol of royalty ( Matthew 2:2 ), being therefore linked with the sceptre ( Numbers 24:17 ). All the glory of the world shall end in being the glory of the Church." Trench's Comm.  </p>
Stargazers	<p>( Isaiah 47:13 ), those who pretend to tell what will occur by looking upon the stars. The Chaldean astrologers "divined by the rising and setting, the motions, aspects, colour, degree of light, etc., of the stars."  </p>
Stars	<p>The eleven stars ( Genesis 37:9 ); the seven ( Amos 5:8 ); wandering ( Jude 1:13 ); seen in the east at the birth of Christ, probably some luminous meteors miraculously formed for this specific purpose ( Matthew 2:2-10 ); stars worshipped ( Deuteronomy 4:19 ;  2 Kings  17:16 ;  21:3 ;  Jeremiah 19:13 ); spoken of symbolically ( Numbers 24:17 ;  Revelation 1:16 Revelation 1:20 ;  12:1 ). (See ASTROLOGERS .) </p>
Stater	<p>Greek word rendered "piece of money" ( Matthew 17:27 , A.V.; and "shekel" in RSV). It was equal to two didrachmas ("tribute money,"  17:24 ), or four drachmas, and to about 2s. 6d. of our money. (See SHEKEL .) </p>
Stealing	<p>See THEFT . </p>
Steel	<p>The "bow of steel" in (A.V.)  2 Samuel 22:35 ;  Job 20:24 ;  Psalms 18:34  is in the Revised Version "bow of brass" (Heb. kesheth-nehushah). In  Jeremiah 15:12  the same word is used, and is also rendered in the Revised Version "brass." But more correctly it is copper (q.v.), as brass in the ordinary sense of the word (an alloy of copper and zinc) was not known to the ancients.  </p>
Stephanas	<p>crown, a member of the church at Corinth, whose family were among those the apostle had baptized ( 1 Corinthians 1:16 ;  1 Corinthians 16:15 1 Corinthians 16:17 ). He has been supposed by some to have been the "jailer of Philippi" (Compare  Acts 16:33 ). The First Epistle to the Corinthians was written from Philippi some six years after the jailer's conversion, and he was with the apostle there at that time.  </p>
Stephen	<p>one of the seven deacons, who became a preacher of the gospel. He was the first Christian martyr. His personal character and history are recorded in  Acts 6 . "He fell asleep" with a prayer for his persecutors on his lips ( 7:60 ). Devout men carried him to his grave ( 8:2 ).  </p><p> It was at the feet of the young Pharisee, Saul of Tarsus, that those who stoned him laid their clothes (Compare  Deuteronomy 17:5-7 ) before they began their cruel work. The scene which Saul then witnessed and the words he heard appear to have made a deep and lasting impression on his mind ( Acts 22:19 Acts 22:20 ).  </p><p> The speech of Stephen before the Jewish ruler is the first apology for the universalism of the gospel as a message to the Gentiles as well as the Jews. It is the longest speech contained in the Acts, a place of prominence being given to it as a defence. </p>
Stoics	<p>a sect of Greek philosophers at Athens, so called from the Greek word stoa i.e., a "porch" or "portico," where they have been called "the Pharisees of Greek paganism." The founder of the Stoics was Zeno, who flourished about B.C. 300. He taught his disciples that a man's happiness consisted in bringing himself into harmony with the course of the universe. They were trained to bear evils with indifference, and so to be independent of externals. Materialism, pantheism, fatalism, and pride were the leading features of this philosophy.  </p>
Stomacher	<p>( Isaiah 3:24 ), an article of female attire, probably some sort of girdle around the breast.  </p>
Stone	<p>Stones were commonly used for buildings, also as memorials of important events ( Genesis 28:18 ;  Joshua 24:26 Joshua 24:27 ;  1 Samuel 7:12 , etc.). They were gathered out of cultivated fields ( Isaiah 5:2 ; Compare  2 Kings 3:19 ). This word is also used figuratively of believers ( 1 Peter 2:4 1 Peter 2:5 ), and of the Messiah ( Psalms 118:22 ;  Isaiah 28:16 ;  Matthew 21:42 ;  Acts 4:11 , etc.). In  Daniel 2:45  it refers also to the Messiah. He is there described as "cut out of the mountain." (See ROCK .) </p><p> A "heart of stone" denotes great insensibility ( 1 Samuel 25:37 ).  </p><p> Stones were set up to commemorate remarkable events, as by Jacob at Bethel ( Genesis 28:18 ), at Padan-aram ( 35:4 ), and on the occasion of parting with Laban ( 31:45-47 ); by Joshua at the place on the banks of the Jordan where the people first "lodged" after crossing the river ( Joshua 6:8 ), and also in "the midst of Jordan," where he erected another set of twelve stones ( 4:1-9 ); and by Samuel at "Ebenezer" ( 1 Samuel 7:12 ).  </p>
Stones, Precious	<p>Frequently referred to ( 1 Kings 10:2 ;  2 Chr  3:6 ;  9:10 ;  Revelation 18:16 ;  21:19 ). There are about twenty different names of such stones in the Bible. They are figuratively introduced to denote value, beauty, durability (Cant  5:14 ;  Isaiah 54:11 Isaiah 54:12 ;  Lamentations 4:7 ).  </p>
Stoning	<p>a form of punishment ( Leviticus 20:2 ;  24:14 ;  Deuteronomy 13:10 ;  17:5 ;  22:21 ) prescribed for certain offences. Of Achan ( Joshua 7:25 ), Naboth ( 1 Kings 21 ), Stephen ( Acts 7:59 ), Paul ( Acts 14:19 ;  2 co  11:25 ).  </p>
Stork	<p>Heb. hasidah, meaning "kindness," indicating thus the character of the bird, which is noted for its affection for its young. It is in the list of birds forbidden to be eaten by the Levitical law ( Leviticus 11:19 ;  Deuteronomy 14:18 ). It is like the crane, but larger in size. Two species are found in Palestine, the white, which are dispersed in pairs over the whole country; and the black, which live in marshy places and in great flocks. They migrate to Palestine periodically (about the 22nd of March). Jeremiah alludes to this ( Jeremiah 8:7 ). At the appointed time they return with unerring sagacity to their old haunts, and re-occupy their old nests. "There is a well-authenticated account of the devotion of a stork which, at the burning of the town of Delft, after repeated and unsuccessful attempts to carry off her young, chose rather to remain and perish with them than leave them to their fate. Well might the Romans call it the pia avis!"  </p><p> In  Job 39:13  (A.V.), instead of the expression "or wings and feathers unto the ostrich" (marg., "the feathers of the stork and ostrich"), the Revised Version has "are her pinions and feathers kindly" (marg., instead of "kindly," reads "like the stork's"). The object of this somewhat obscure verse seems to be to point out a contrast between the stork, as distinguished for her affection for her young, and the ostrich, as distinguished for her indifference.  </p><p>  ( Zechariah 5:9 ) alludes to the beauty and power of the stork's wings.  </p>
Strain at	<p>Simply a misprint for "strain out" ( Matthew 23:24 ).  </p>
Stranger	<p>This word generally denotes a person from a foreign land residing in Palestine. Such persons enjoyed many privileges in common with the Jews, but still were separate from them. The relation of the Jews to strangers was regulated by special laws ( Deuteronomy 23:3 ;  24:14-21 ;  25:5 ;  26:10-13 ). A special signification is also sometimes attached to this word. In  Genesis 23:4  it denotes one resident in a foreign land;  Exodus 23:9 , one who is not a Jew;  Numbers 3:10 , one who is not of the family of Aaron;  Psalms 69:8 , an alien or an unknown person. The Jews were allowed to purchase strangers as slaves ( Leviticus 25:44 Leviticus 25:45 ), and to take usury from them ( Deuteronomy 23:20 ).  </p>
Straw	<p>Used in brick-making ( Exodus 5:7-18 ). Used figuratively in  Job 41:27 ;  Isaiah 11:7 ;  25:10 ;  65:25 .  </p>
Stream of Egypt	<p>( Isaiah 27:12 ), the Wady el-'Arish, called also "the river of Egypt," RSV, "brook of Egypt" ( Numbers 34:5 ;  Joshua 15:4 ;  2 Kings  24:7 ). It is the natural boundary of Egypt. Occasionally in winter, when heavy rains have fallen among the mountains inland, it becomes a turbulent rushing torrent. The present boundary between Egypt and Palestine is about midway between el-'Arish and Gaza.  </p>
Street	<p>The street called "Straight" at Damascus ( Acts 9:11 ) is "a long broad street, running from east to west, about a mile in length, and forming the principal thoroughfare in the city." In Oriental towns streets are usually narrow and irregular and filthy ( Psalms 18:42 ;  Isaiah 10:6 ). "It is remarkable," says Porter, "that all the important cities of Palestine and Syria Samaria, Caesarea, Gerasa, Bozrah, Damascus, Palmyra, had their 'straight streets' running through the centre of the city, and lined with stately rows of columns. The most perfect now remaining are those of Palmyra and Gerasa, where long ranges of the columns still stand.", Through Samaria, etc.  </p>
Stripes	<p>as a punishment were not to exceed forty ( Deuteronomy 25:1-3 ), and hence arose the custom of limiting them to thirty-nine ( 2 Corinthians 11:24 ). Paul claimed the privilege of a Roman citizen in regard to the infliction of stripes ( Acts 16:37 Acts 16:38 ;  22:25-29 ). Our Lord was beaten with stripes ( Matthew 27:26 ).  </p>
Subscriptions	<p>The subscriptions to Paul's epistles are no part of the original. In their present form they are ascribed to Euthalius, a bishop of the fifth century. Some of them are obviously incorrect. </p>
Suburbs	<p>the immediate vicinity of a city or town ( Numbers 35:3 Numbers 35:7 ; Ezek.  45:2 ). In  2 Kings 23:11  the Hebrew word there used (parvarim) occurs nowhere else. The Revised Version renders it "precincts." The singular form of this Hebrew word (parvar) is supposed by some to be the same as Parbar (q.v.), which occurs twice in  1 Chronicles 26:18 .  </p>
Succoth	<p>booths. </p><li> The first encampment of the Israelites after leaving Ramesses ( Exodus 12:37 ); the civil name of Pithom (q.v.).  </li><li> A city on the east of Jordan, identified with Tell Dar'ala, a high mound, a mass of debris, in the plain north of Jabbok and about one mile from it ( Joshua 13:27 ). Here Jacob ( Genesis 32:17 Genesis 32:30 ;  33:17 ), on his return from Padan-aram after his interview with Esau, built a house for himself and made booths for his cattle. The princes of this city churlishly refused to afford help to Gideon and his 300 men when "faint yet pursuing" they followed one of the bands of the fugitive Midianites after the great victory at Gilboa. After overtaking and routing this band at Karkor, Gideon on his return visited the rulers of the city with severe punishment. "He took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth" ( Judges 8:13-16 ). At this place were erected the foundries for casting the metal-work for the temple ( 1 Kings 7:46 ).   </li>
Succoth-benoth	<p>tents of daughters, supposed to be the name of a Babylonian deity, the goddess Zir-banit, the wife of Merodach, worshipped by the colonists in Samaria ( 2 Kings 17:30 ).  </p>
Sukkiims	<p>dwellers in tents, (Vulg. and LXX., "troglodites;" i.e., cave-dwellers in the hills along the Red Sea). Shiskak's army, with which he marched against Jerusalem, was composed partly of this tribe ( 2 Chronicles 12:3 ).  </p>
Sun	<p>(Heb. shemesh), first mentioned along with the moon as the two great luminaries of heaven ( Genesis 1:14-18 ). By their motions and influence they were intended to mark and divide times and seasons. The worship of the sun was one of the oldest forms of false religion ( Job 31:26 Job 31:27 ), and was common among the Egyptians and Chaldeans and other pagan nations. The Jews were warned against this form of idolatry ( Deuteronomy 4:19 ;  17:3 ; Compare  2 Kings 23:11 ;  Jeremiah 19:13 ).  </p>
Suph	<p>( Deuteronomy 1:1 , RSV; marg., "some ancient versions have the Red Sea," as in the A.V.). Some identify it with Suphah ( Numbers 21:14 , marg., A.V.) as probably the name of a place. Others identify it with es-Sufah = Maaleh-acrabbim ( Joshua 15:3 ), and others again with Zuph ( 1 Samuel 9:5 ). It is most probable, however, that, in accordance with the ancient versions, this word is to be regarded as simply an abbreviation of Yam-suph, i.e., the "Red Sea."  </p>
Suphah	<p>( Numbers 21:14 , marg.; also RSV), a place at the south-eastern corner of the Dead Sea, the Ghor es-Safieh. This name is found in an ode quoted from the "Book of the Wars of the Lord," probably a collection of odes commemorating the triumphs of God's people (comp  Numbers 21:14 Numbers 21:17 Numbers 21:18 Numbers 21:27-30 ).  </p>
Supper	<p>the principal meal of the day among the Jews. It was partaken of in the early part of the evening ( Mark 6:21 ;  John 12:2 ;  1 Corinthians 11:21 ). (See LORD'S  SUPPER .) </p>
Surety	<p>one who becomes responsible for another. Christ is the surety of the better covenant ( Hebrews 7:22 ). In him we have the assurance that all its provisions will be fully and faithfully carried out. Solomon warns against incautiously becoming security for another ( Proverbs 6:1-5 ;  11:15 ;  17:18 ;  20:16 ).  </p>
Susanchites	<p>the inhabitants of Shushan, who joined the other adversaries of the Jews in the attempt to prevent the rebuilding of the temple ( Ezra 4:9 ).  </p>
Susanna	<p>lily, with other pious women, ministered to Jesus ( Luke 8:3 ).  </p>
Susi	<p>the father of Gaddi, who was one of the twelve spies ( Numbers 13:11 ).  </p>
Swallow	<p></p><li> Heb. sis ( Isaiah 38:14 ;  Jeremiah 8:7 ), the Arabic for the swift, which "is a regular migrant, returning in myriads every spring, and so suddenly that while one day not a swift can be seen in the country, on the next they have overspread the whole land, and fill the air with their shrill cry." The swift (cypselus) is ordinarily classed with the swallow, which it resembles in its flight, habits, and migration.  </li><li> Heb. deror, i.e., "the bird of freedom" ( Psalms 84:3 ;  Proverbs 26:2 ), properly rendered swallow, distinguished for its swiftness of flight, its love of freedom, and the impossibility of retaining it in captivity. In  Isaiah 38:14  and  Jeremiah 8:7  the word thus rendered ('augr) properly means "crane" (as in the RSV).   </li>
Swan	<p>mentioned in the list of unclean birds ( Leviticus 11:18 ;  Deuteronomy 14:16 ), is sometimes met with in the Jordan and the Sea of Galilee.  </p>
Swelling	<p>of Jordan ( Jeremiah 12:5 ), literally the "pride" of Jordan (as in RSV), i.e., the luxuriant thickets of tamarisks, poplars, reeds, etc., which were the lair of lions and other beasts of prey. The reference is not to the overflowing of the river banks. (Comp  49:19 ;  50:44 ;  Zechariah 11:3 ).  </p>
Swine	<p>(Heb. hazir), regarded as the most unclean and the most abhorred of all animals ( Leviticus 11:7 ;  Isaiah 65:4 ;  Isaiah 66:3 Isaiah 66:17 ;  Luke 15:15 Luke 15:16 ). A herd of swine were drowned in the Sea of Galilee ( Luke 8:32 Luke 8:33 ). Spoken of figuratively in  Matthew 7:6  (see  Proverbs 11:22 ). It is frequently mentioned as a wild animal, and is evidently the wild boar (Arab. khanzir), which is common among the marshes of the Jordan valley ( Psalms 80:13 ).  </p>
Sword	<p>of the Hebrew was pointed, sometimes two-edged, was worn in a sheath, and suspended from the girdle ( Exodus 32:27 ;  1 Samuel 31:4 ;  1 Chronicles 21:27 ;  Psalms 149:6 :  Proverbs 5:4 ;  Ezekiel 16:40 ;  21:3-5 ).  </p><p> It is a symbol of divine chastisement ( Deuteronomy 32:25 ;  Psalms 7:12 ;  78:62 ), and of a slanderous tongue ( Psalms 57:4 ;  64:3 ;  Proverbs 12:18 ). The word of God is likened also to a sword ( Hebrews 4:12 ;  Ephesians 6:17 ;  Revelation 1:16 ). Gideon's watchword was, "The sword of the Lord" ( Judges 7:20 ).  </p>
Sycamine tree	<p>mentioned only in  Luke 17:6 . It is rendered by Luther "mulberry tree" (q.v.), which is most probably the correct rendering. It is found of two species, the black mulberry (Morus nigra) and the white mulberry (Mourea), which are common in Palestine. The silk-worm feeds on their leaves. The rearing of them is one of the chief industries of the peasantry of Lebanon and of other parts of the land. It is of the order of the fig-tree. Some contend, however, that this name denotes the sycamore-fig of  Luke 19:4 .  </p>
Sycamore	<p>more properly sycomore (Heb. shikmoth and shikmim, Gr. sycomoros), a tree which in its general character resembles the fig-tree, while its leaves resemble those of the mulberry; hence it is called the fig-mulberry (Ficus sycomorus). At Jericho, Zacchaeus climbed a sycomore-tree to see Jesus as he passed by ( Luke 19:4 ). This tree was easily destroyed by frost ( Psalms 78:47 ), and therefore it is found mostly in the "vale" ( 1 Kings 10:27 ;  2 Chr  1:15 : in both passages the RSV has properly "lowland"), i.e., the "low country," the shephelah, where the climate is mild. ( Amos 7:14 ) refers to its fruit, which is of an inferior character; so also probably ( Jeremiah 24:2 ). It is to be distinguished from our sycamore (the Acer pseudo-platanus), which is a species of maple often called a plane-tree.  </p>
Sychar	<p>liar or drunkard (see  Isaiah 28:1 Isaiah 28:7 ), has been from the time of the Crusaders usually identified with Sychem or Shechem ( John 4:5 ). It has now, however, as the result of recent explorations, been identified with 'Askar, a small Samaritan town on the southern base of Ebal, about a mile to the north of Jacob's well.  </p>

Syene	<p>opening ( Ezekiel 29:10 ;  30:6 ), a town of Egypt, on the borders of Ethiopia, now called Assouan, on the right bank of the Nile, notable for its quarries of beautiful red granite called "syenite." It was the frontier town of Egypt in the south, as Migdol was in the north-east.  </p>
Synagogue	<p>(Gr. sunagoge, i.e., "an assembly"), found only once in the Authorized Version of  Psalms 74:8 , where the margin of Revised Version has "places of assembly," which is probably correct; for while the origin of synagogues is unknown, it may well be supposed that buildings or tents for the accommodation of worshippers may have existed in the land from an early time, and thus the system of synagogues would be gradually developed.  </p><p> Some, however, are of opinion that it was specially during the Babylonian captivity that the system of synagogue worship, if not actually introduced, was at least reorganized on a systematic plan ( Ezekiel 8:1 ;  14:1 ). The exiles gathered together for the reading of the law and the prophets as they had opportunity, and after their return synagogues were established all over the land ( Ezra 8:15 ;  Nehemiah 8:2 ). In after years, when the Jews were dispersed abroad, wherever they went they erected synagogues and kept up the stated services of worship ( Acts 9:20 ;  13:5 ;  17:1 ;  17:17 ;  18:4 ). The form and internal arrangements of the synagogue would greatly depend on the wealth of the Jews who erected it, and on the place where it was built. "Yet there are certain traditional pecularities which have doubtless united together by a common resemblance the Jewish synagogues of all ages and countries. The arrangements for the women's place in a separate gallery or behind a partition of lattice-work; the desk in the centre, where the reader, like Ezra in ancient days, from his 'pulpit of wood,' may 'open the book in the sight of all of people and read in the book of the law of God distinctly, and give the sense, and cause them to understand the reading' ( Nehemiah 8:4 Nehemiah 8:8 ); the carefully closed ark on the side of the building nearest to Jerusalem, for the preservation of the rolls or manuscripts of the law; the seats all round the building, whence 'the eyes of all them that are in the synagogue' may 'be fastened' on him who speaks ( Luke 4:20 ); the 'chief seats' ( Matthew 23:6 ) which were appropriated to the 'ruler' or 'rulers' of the synagogue, according as its organization may have been more or less complete;", these were features common to all the synagogues.  </p><p> Where perfected into a system, the services of the synagogue, which were at the same hours as those of the temple, consisted, (1) of prayer, which formed a kind of liturgy, there were in all eighteen prayers; (2) the reading of the Scriptures in certain definite portions; and (3) the exposition of the portions read. (See   Luke 4:15 Luke 4:22 ;  Acts 13:14 .)  </p><p> The synagogue was also sometimes used as a court of judicature, in which the rulers presided ( Matthew 10:17 ;  Mark 5:22 ;  Luke 12:11 ;  21:12 ;  Acts 13:15 ;  22:19 ); also as public schools.  </p><p> The establishment of synagogues wherever the Jews were found in sufficient numbers helped greatly to keep alive Israel's hope of the coming of the Messiah, and to prepare the way for the spread of the gospel in other lands. The worship of the Christian Church was afterwards modelled after that of the synagogue. </p><p> Christ and his disciples frequently taught in the synagogues ( Matthew 13:54 ;  Mark 6:2 ;  John 18:20 ;  Acts 13:5 Acts 13:15 Acts 13:44 ;  14:1 ;  Acts 17:2-4 Acts 17:10 Acts 17:17 ;  Acts 18:4 Acts 18:26 ;  19:8 ).  </p><p> To be "put out of the synagogue," a phrase used by ( John 9:22 ;  12:42 ;  16:2 ), means to be excommunicated.  </p>
Syntyche	<p>fortunate; affable, a female member of the church at Philippi, whom Paul beseeches to be of one mind with Euodias ( Philippians 4:2 Philippians 4:3 ).  </p>
Syracuse	<p>a city on the south-east coast of Sicily, where Paul landed and remained three days when on his way to Rome ( Acts 28:12 ). It was distinguished for its magnitude and splendour. It is now a small town of some 13,000 inhabitants.  </p>
Syria	<p>(Heb. Aram), the name in the Old Testament given to the whole country which lay to the north-east of Phoenicia, extending to beyond the Euphrates and the Tigris. Mesopotamia is called ( Genesis 24:10 ;  Deuteronomy 23:4 ) Aram-naharain (=Syria of the two rivers), also Padan-aram ( Genesis 25:20 ). Other portions of Syria were also known by separate names, as Aram-maahah ( 1 Chronicles 19:6 ), Aram-beth-rehob ( 2 Samuel 10:6 ), Aram-zobah ( 2 Samuel 10:6 2 Samuel 10:8 ). All these separate little kingdoms afterwards became subject to Damascus. In the time of the Romans, Syria included also a part of Palestine and Asia Minor.  </p><p> "From the historic annals now accessible to us, the history of Syria may be divided into three periods: The first, the period when the power of the Pharaohs was dominant over the fertile fields or plains of Syria and the merchant cities of Tyre and Sidon, and when such mighty conquerors as Thothmes III. and Rameses II. could claim dominion and levy tribute from the nations from the banks of the Euphrates to the borders of the Libyan desert. Second, this was followed by a short period of independence, when the Jewish nation in the south was growing in power, until it reached its early zenith in the golden days of Solomon; and when Tyre and Sidon were rich cities, sending their traders far and wide, over land and sea, as missionaries of civilization, while in the north the confederate tribes of the Hittites held back the armies of the kings of Assyria. The third, and to us most interesting, period is that during which the kings of Assyria were dominant over the plains of Syria; when Tyre, Sidon, Ashdod, and Jerusalem bowed beneath the conquering armies of Shalmaneser, Sargon, and Sennacherib; and when at last Memphis and Thebes yielded to the power of the rulers of Nineveh and Babylon, and the kings of Assyria completed with terrible fulness the bruising of the reed of Egypt so clearly foretold by the Hebrew prophets.", Boscawen. </p>
Syriac	<p>( 2 Kings 18:26 ;  Ezra 4:7 ;  Daniel 2:4 ), more correctly rendered "Aramaic," including both the Syriac and the Chaldee languages. In the New Testament there are several Syriac words, such as "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" ( Mark 15:34 ;  Matthew 27:46  gives the Heb. form, "Eli, Eli"), "Raca" ( Matthew 5:22 ), "Ephphatha" ( Mark 7:34 ), "Maran-atha" ( 1 Corinthians 16:22 ).  </p><p> A Syriac version of the Old Testament, containing all the canonical books, along with some apocryphal books (called the Peshitto, i.e., simple translation, and not a paraphrase), was made early in the second century, and is therefore the first Christian translation of the Old Testament. It was made directly from the original, and not from the LXX. Version. The New Testament was also translated from Greek into Syriac about the same time. It is noticeable that this version does not contain the Second and Third Epistles of John, 2Peter, Jude, and the Apocalypse. These were, however, translated subsequently and placed in the version. (See VERSION .) </p>
Syrophenician	<p>"a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation" ( Mark 7:26 ), i.e., a Gentile born in the Phoenician part of Syria. (See PHENICIA .) </p><p> When our Lord retired into the borderland of Tyre and Sidon ( Matthew 15:21 ), a Syro-phoenician woman came to him, and earnestly besought him, in behalf of her daughter, who was grievously afflicted with a demon. Her faith in him was severely tested by his silence ( Matthew 15:23 ), refusal (24), and seeming reproach that it was not meet to cast the children's bread to dogs (26). But it stood the test, and her petition was graciously granted, because of the greatness of her faith (28).  </p>
Threshing	<p>See AGRICULTURE . </p>
Threshold	<p></p><li> Heb. miphtan, probably a projecting beam at a higher point than the threshold proper ( 1 Samuel 5:4 1 Samuel 5:5 ;  Ezekiel 9:3 ;  Ezekiel 10:4 Ezekiel 10:18 ;  46:2 ;  47:1 ); also rendered "door" and "door-post."  </li><li> 'Asuppim, pl. ( Nehemiah 12:25 ), rendered correctly "storehouses" in the Revised Version. In 1Chr 26:15,17the Authorized Version retains the word as a proper name, while in the Revised Version it is translated "storehouses."   </li>
Throne	<p>(Heb. kiss'e), a royal chair or seat of dignity ( Deuteronomy 17:18 ;  2 Sam  7:13 ;  Psalms 45:6 ); an elevated seat with a canopy and hangings, which cover it. It denotes the seat of the high priest in  1 Samuel 1:9 ;  4:13 , and of a provincial governor in  Nehemiah 3:7  and  Psalms 122:5 . The throne of Solomon is described at length in  1 Kings 10:18-20 .  </p>
Thummim	<p>perfection (LXX., "truth;" Vulg., "veritas"),  Exodus 28:30 ;  Deuteronomy 33:8 ;  Judges 1:1 ;  20:18 ;  1 Samuel 14:3 1 Samuel 14:18 ;  23:9 ;  2 Sam  21:1 . What the "Urim and Thummim" were cannot be determined with any certainty. All we certainly know is that they were a certain divinely-given means by which God imparted, through the high priest, direction and counsel to Israel when these were needed. The method by which this was done can be only a matter of mere conjecture. They were apparently material objects, quite distinct from the breastplate, but something added to it after all the stones had been set in it, something in addition to the breastplate and its jewels. They may have been, as some suppose, two small images, like the teraphim (Compare  Judges 17:5 ;  Judges 18:14 Judges 18:17 Judges 18:20 ;  Hosea 3:4 ), which were kept in the bag of the breastplate, by which, in some unknown way, the high priest could give forth his divinely imparted decision when consulted. They were probably lost at the destruction of the temple by Nebuchadnezzar. They were never seen after the return from captivity.  </p>
Thunder	<p>often referred to in Scripture ( Job 40:9 ;  Psalms 77:18 ;  104:7 ). James and John were called by our Lord "sons of thunder" ( Mark 3:17 ). In  Job 39:19 , instead of "thunder," as in the Authorized Version, the Revised Version translates (ra'amah) by "quivering main" (marg., "shaking"). Thunder accompanied the giving of the law at Sinai ( Exodus 19:16 ). It was regarded as the voice of God ( Job 37:2 ;  Psalms 18:13 ;  81:7 ; Compare  John 12:29 ). In answer to Samuel's prayer ( 1 Samuel 12:17 1 Samuel 12:18 ), God sent thunder, and "all the people greatly feared," for at such a season (the wheat-harvest) thunder and rain were almost unknown in Palestine.  </p>
Thyatira	<p>a city of Asia Minor, on the borders of Lydia and Mysia. Its modern name is Ak-hissar, i.e., "white castle." Here was one of the seven churches ( Revelation 1:11 ;  2:18-28 ). Lydia, the seller of purple, or rather of cloth dyed with this colour, was from this city ( Acts 16:14 ). It was and still is famous for its dyeing. Among the ruins, inscriptions have been found relating to the guild of dyers in that city in ancient times.  </p>
Thyine wood	<p>mentioned only in  Revelation 18:12  among the articles which would cease to be purchased when Babylon fell. It was called citrus, citron wood, by the Romans. It was the Callitris quadrivalvis of botanists, of the cone-bearing order of trees, and of the cypress tribe of this order. The name of this wood is derived from the Greek word <i> thuein</i> , "to sacrifice," and it was so called because it was burnt in sacrifices, on account of its fragrance. The wood of this tree was reckoned very valuable, and was used for making articles of furniture by the Greeks and Romans. Like the cedars of Lebanon, it is disappearing from the forests of Palestine. </p>
Tiberias	<p>a city, the modern Tubarich, on the western shore of the Sea of Tiberias. It is said to have been founded by Herod Antipas (A.D. 16), on the site of the ruins of an older city called Rakkath, and to have been thus named by him after the Emperor Tiberius. It is mentioned only three times in the history of our Lord ( John 6:1 John 6:23 ;  21:1 ).  </p><p> In 1837 about one-half of the inhabitants perished by an earthquake. The population of the city is now about six thousand, nearly the one-half being Jews. "We do not read that our Lord ever entered this city. The reason of this is probably to be found in the fact that it was practically a heathen city, though standing upon Jewish soil. Herod, its founder, had brought together the arts of Greece, the idolatry of Rome, and the gross lewdness of Asia. There were in it a theatre for the performance of comedies, a forum, a stadium, a palace roofed with gold in imitation of those in Italy, statues of the Roman gods, and busts of the deified emperors. He who was not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel might well hold himself aloof from such scenes as these" (Manning's Those Holy Fields).  </p><p> After the fall of Jerusalem (A.D. 70), Tiberias became one of the chief residences of the Jews in Palestine. It was for more than three hundred years their metropolis. From about A.D. 150 the Sanhedrin settled here, and established rabbinical schools, which rose to great celebrity. Here the Jerusalem (or Palestinian) Talmud was compiled about the beginning of the fifth century. To this same rabbinical school also we are indebted for the Masora, a "body of traditions which transmitted the readings of the Hebrew text of the Old Testament, and preserved, by means of the vowel-system, the pronunciation of the Hebrew." In its original form, and in all manuscripts, the Hebrew is written without vowels; hence, when it ceased to be a spoken language, the importance of knowing what vowels to insert between the consonants. This is supplied by the Masora, and hence these vowels are called the "Masoretic vowel-points."  </p>
Tiberias, Sea of	<p>called also the Sea of Galilee (q.v.) and of Gennesaret. In the Old Testament it is called the Sea of Chinnereth or Chinneroth. ( John 21:1 ) is the only evangelist who so designates this lake. His doing so incidentally confirms the opinion that he wrote after the other evangelists, and at a period subsequent to the taking of Jerusalem (A.D. 70). Tiberias had by this time become an important city, having been spared by the Romans, and made the capital of the province when Jerusalem was destroyed. It thus naturally gave its name to the lake.  </p>
Tiberius Caesar	<p>i.e., as known in Roman history, Tiberius Claudius Nero, only mentioned in  Luke 3:1 . He was the stepson of Augustus, whom he succeeded on the throne, A.D. 14. He was noted for his vicious and infamous life. In the fifteenth year of his reign John the Baptist entered on his public ministry, and under him also our Lord taught and suffered. He died A.D. 37. He is frequently referred to simply as "Caesar" ( Matthew 22:17 Matthew 22:21 ;  Mark 12:14 Mark 12:16 Mark 12:17 ;  Luke 20:22 Luke 20:24 Luke 20:25 ;  23:2 ;  John 19:12 John 19:15 ).  </p>
Tibni	<p>building of Jehovah, the son of Ginath, a man of some position, whom a considerable number of the people chose as monarch. For the period of four years he contended for the throne with Omri ( 1 Kings 16:21 1 Kings 16:22 ), who at length gained the mastery, and became sole monarch of Israel.  </p>
Tidal	<p>(in the LXX. called "Thorgal"), styled the "king of nations" (Gen.14:1-9). Mentioned as Tudkhula on Arioch's brick (see facing page 139). <i> Goyyim</i> , translated "nations," is the country called Gutium, east of Tigris and north of Elam. </p>
Tiglath-Pileser I.	<p>(not mentioned in Scripture) was the most famous of the monarchs of the first Assyrian empire (about B.C. 1110). After his death, for two hundred years the empire fell into decay. The history of David and Solomon falls within this period. He was succeeded by his son, Shalmaneser II.  </p>
Tiglath-Pileser III.	<p>or Tilgath-Pil-neser, the Assyrian throne-name of Pul (q.v.). He appears in the Assyrian records as gaining, in the fifth year of his reign (about B.C. 741), a victory over Azariah (= Uzziah in 2Chr.26:1), king of Judah, whose achievements are described in  2 Chronicles 26:6-15 . He is first mentioned in Scripture, however, as gaining a victory over Pekah, king of Israel, and Rezin of Damascus, who were confederates. He put Rezin to death, and punished Pekah by taking a considerable portion of his kingdom, and carrying off (B.C. 734) a vast number of its inhabitants into captivity ( 2 Kings 15:29 ;  16:5-9 ;  1 Chronicles 5:6 1 Chronicles 5:26 ), the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh whom he settled in Gozan. In the Assyrian annals it is further related that, before he returned from Syria, he held a court at Damascus, and received submission and tribute from the neighbouring kings, among whom were Pekah of Samaria and "Yahu-khazi [i.e., Ahaz], king of Judah" (Compare  2 Kings 16:10-16 ).  </p><p> He was the founder of what is called "the second Assyrian empire," an empire meant to embrace the whole world, the centre of which should be Nineveh. He died B.C. 728, and was succeeded by a general of his army, Ulula, who assumed the name Shalmaneser IV.  </p>
Timaeus	<p>defiled, the father of blind Bartimaeus ( Mark 10:46 ).  </p>
Timbrel	<p>(Heb. toph), a small drum or tambourine; a tabret (q.v.). The antiquity of this musical instrument appears from the scriptural allusions to it ( Genesis 31:27 ;  Exodus 15:20 ;  Judges 11:34 , etc.) (See MUSIC .) </p>
Timnah	<p>a portion. </p><li> A town of Judah ( Joshua 15:10 ). The Philistines took possession of it in the days of Ahaz ( 2 Chronicles 28:18 ). It was about 20 miles west of Jerusalem. It has been identified with Timnatha of Dan ( Joshua 19:43 ), and also with Timnath (Judg.  Joshua 14:1 Joshua 14:5 ).  </li><li> A city in the mountains of Judah (Josh.15:57)= Tibna near Jeba'.  </li><li> A "duke" or sheik of Edom ( Genesis 36:40 ).   </li>
Timnath	<p> Genesis 38:12 Genesis 38:14 . </p><li> Heb. Timnathah, which is appropriately rendered in the Revised Version, Timnah, a town in Judah.  </li><li> The town where Samson sojourned, probably identical with "Timnah" (1) ( Judges 14:1-18 ).   </li>
Timnath-heres	<p>portion of the sun, where Joshua was buried ( Judges 2:9 ). It was "in the mount of Ephraim, in the north side of the hill Gaash," 10 miles south-west of Shechem. The same as the following.  </p>
Timnath-serah	<p>remaining portion, the city of Joshua in the hill country of Ephraim, the same as Timnath-heres ( Joshua 19:50 ;  24:30 ). "Of all sites I have seen," says Lieut. Col. Conder, "none is so striking as that of Joshua's home, surrounded as it is with deep valleys and wild, rugged hills." Opposite the town is a hill, on the northern side of which there are many excavated sepulchres. Among these is the supposed tomb of Joshua, which is said to be "the most striking monument in the country." It is a "square chamber with five excavations in three of its sides, the central one forming a passage leading into a second chamber beyond. A great number of lamp-niches cover the walls of the porch, upwards of two hundred, arranged in vertical rows. A single cavity with a niche for a lamp has been thought to be the resting-place of the warrior-chief of Israel." The modern Kefr Haris, 10 miles south-west of Shechem.  </p>
Timnite	<p>a man of Timnah. Samson's father-in-law is so styled (Judg.  15:6 ).  </p>
Timon	<p>honouring, one of the seven deacons at Jerusalem ( Acts 6:5 ). Nothing further is known of him.  </p>
Timotheus	<p>the Greek form of the name of Timothy ( Acts 16:1 , etc.; the RSV always "Timothy").  </p>
Timothy	<p>honouring God, a young disciple who was Paul's companion in many of his journeyings. His mother, Eunice, and his grandmother, Lois, are mentioned as eminent for their piety ( 2 Timothy 1:5 ). We know nothing of his father but that he was a Greek ( Acts 16:1 ). He is first brought into notice at the time of Paul's second visit to Lystra ( 16:2 ), where he probably resided, and where it seems he was converted during Paul's first visit to that place ( 1 Timothy 1:2 ;  2 Tim  3:11 ). The apostle having formed a high opinion of his "own son in the faith," arranged that he should become his companion ( Acts 16:3 ), and took and circumcised him, so that he might conciliate the Jews. He was designated to the office of an evangelist ( 1 Timothy 4:14 ), and went with Paul in his journey through Phrygia, Galatia, and Mysia; also to Troas and Philippi and Berea ( Acts 17:14 ). Thence he followed Paul to Athens, and was sent by him with Silas on a mission to Thessalonica ( 17:15 ;  1 Thessalonians 3:2 ). We next find him at Corinth ( 1 Thessalonians 1:1 ;  2 th  1:1 ) with Paul. He passes now out of sight for a few years, and is again noticed as with the apostle at Ephesus ( Acts 19:22 ), whence he is sent on a mission into Macedonia. He accompanied Paul afterwards into Asia ( 20:4 ), where he was with him for some time. When the apostle was a prisoner at Rome, Timothy joined him (Phil  1:1 ), where it appears he also suffered imprisonment ( Hebrews 13:23 ). During the apostle's second imprisonment he wrote to Timothy, asking him to rejoin him as soon as possible, and to bring with him certain things which he had left at Troas, his cloak and parchments ( 2 Timothy 4:13 ). According to tradition, after the apostle's death he settled in Ephesus as his sphere of labour, and there found a martyr's grave.  </p>
Timothy, First Epistle to	<p>Paul in this epistle speaks of himself as having left Ephesus for Macedonia ( 1:3 ), and hence not Laodicea, as mentioned in the subscription; but probably Philippi, or some other city in that region, was the place where this epistle was written. During the interval between his first and second imprisonments he probably visited the scenes of his former labours in Greece and Asia, and then found his way into Macedonia, whence he wrote this letter to Timothy, whom he had left behind in Ephesus.  </p><p> It was probably written about A.D. 66 or 67.  </p><p> The epistle consists mainly, (1) of counsels to Timothy regarding the worship and organization of the Church, and the responsibilities resting on its several members; and (2) of exhortation to faithfulness in maintaining the truth amid surrounding errors.  </p>
Timothy, Second Epistle to	<p>was probably written a year or so after the first, and from Rome, where Paul was for a second time a prisoner, and was sent to Timothy by the hands of Tychicus. In it he entreats Timothy to come to him before winter, and to bring Mark with him (Compare Phil  2:22 ). He was anticipating that "the time of his departure was at hand" ( 2 Timothy 4:6 ), and he exhorts his "son Timothy" to all diligence and steadfastness, and to patience under persecution ( 1:6-15 ), and to a faithful discharge of all the duties of his office ( 4:1-5 ), with all the solemnity of one who was about to appear before the Judge of quick and dead.  </p>
Tin	<p>Heb. bedil ( Numbers 31:22 ;  Ezekiel 22:18 Ezekiel 22:20 ), a metal well known in ancient times. It is the general opinion that the Phoenicians of Tyre and Sidon obtained their supplies of tin from the British Isles. In  Ezekiel 27:12  it is said to have been brought from Tarshish, which was probably a commercial emporium supplied with commodities from other places. In  Isaiah 1:25  the word so rendered is generally understood of lead, the alloy with which the silver had become mixed (ver. 22). The fire of the Babylonish Captivity would be the means of purging out the idolatrous alloy that had corrupted the people.  </p>
Tinkling ornaments	<p>( Isaiah 3:18 ), anklets of silver or gold, etc., such as are still used by women in Syria and the East.  </p>
Tiphsah	<p>passing over; ford, one of the boundaries of Solomon's dominions ( 1 Kings 4:24 ), probably "Thapsacus, a great and wealthy town on the western bank of the Euphrates," about 100 miles north-east of Tadmor. All the land traffic between the east and the west passed through it. Menahem undertook an expedition against this city, and "smote Tiphsah and all that were therein" ( 2 Kings 15:16 ). This expedition implied a march of some 300 miles from Tirzah if by way of Tadmor, and about 400 if by way of Aleppo; and its success showed the strength of the Israelite kingdom, for it was practically a defiance to Assyria. Conder, however, identifies this place with Khurbet Tafsah, some 6 miles west of Shechem.  </p>
Tiras	<p>the youngest of the sons of Japheth ( Genesis 10:2 ;  1 Chronicles 1:5 ).  </p>
Tires	<p>"To tire" the head is to adorn it ( 2 Kings 9:30 ). As a noun the word is derived from "tiara," and is the rendering of the Heb. p'er, a "turban" or an ornament for the head ( Ezekiel 24:17 ; RSV, "headtire;"  24:23 ). In  Isaiah 3:18  the word <i> saharonim</i> is rendered "round tires like the moon," and in Jud 8:21,26"ornaments," but in both cases "crescents" in the Revised Version.  </p>
Tirhakah	<p>the last king of Egypt of the Ethiopian (the fifteenth) dynasty. He was the brother-in-law of So (q.v.). He probably ascended the throne about B.C. 692, having been previously king of Ethiopia ( 2 Kings 19:9 ;  Isaiah 37:9 ), which with Egypt now formed one nation. He was a great warrior, and but little is known of him. The Assyrian armies under Esarhaddon, and again under Assur-bani-pal, invaded Egypt and defeated Tirhakah, who afterwards retired into Ethiopia, where he died, after reigning twenty-six years.  </p>
Tirshatha	<p>a word probably of Persian origin, meaning "severity," denoting a high civil dignity. The Persian governor of Judea is so called ( Ezra 2:63 ;  Nehemiah 7:65 Nehemiah 7:70 ). Nehemiah is called by this name in  Nehemiah 8:9 ;  10:1 , and the "governor" (pehah) in  5:18 . Probably, therefore, tirshatha=pehah=the modern pasha.  </p>
Tirza	<p>pleasantness. </p><li> An old royal city of the Canaanites, which was destroyed by Joshua ( Joshua 12:24 ). Jeroboam chose it for his residence, and he removed to it from Shechem, which at first he made the capital of his kingdom. It remained the chief residence of the kings of Israel till Omri took Samaria ( 1 Kings 14:17 ;  15:21 ;  1 Kings 16:6 1 Kings 16:8 , etc.). Here Zimri perished amid the flames of the palace to which in his despair he had set fire ( 1 Kings 16:18 ), and here Menahem smote Shallum ( 2 Kings 15:14 2 Kings 15:16 ). Solomon refers to its beauty (Cant  6:4 ). It has been identified with the modern mud hamlet Teiasir, 11 miles north of Shechem. Others, however, would identify it with Telluza, a village about 6 miles east of Samaria.  </li><li> The youngest of Zelophehad's five daughters ( Numbers 26:33 ;  Joshua 17:3 ).   </li>
Tishbite	<p>Elijah the prophet was thus named ( 1 Kings 17:1 ;  1 Kings 21:17 1 Kings 21:28 , etc.). In  1 Kings 17:1  the word rendered "inhabitants" is in the original the same as that rendered "Tishbite," hence that verse may be read as in the LXX., "Elijah the Tishbite of Tishbi in Gilead." Some interpret this word as meaning "stranger," and read the verse, "Elijah the stranger from among the strangers in Gilead." This designation is probably given to the prophet as denoting that his birthplace was Tishbi, a place in Upper Galilee (mentioned in the apocryphal book of Tobit), from which for some reason he migrated into Gilead. Josephus, the Jewish historian (Ant  1 Kings 8:13 1 Kings 8:2 ), however, supposes that Tishbi was some place in the land of Gilead. It has been identified by some with el-Ishtib, a some place 22 miles due south of the Sea of Galilee, among the mountains of Gilead.  </p>
Tisri	<p>the first month of the civil year, and the seventh of the ecclesiastical year. See ETHANIM ( 1 Kings 8:2 ). Called in the Assyrian inscriptions Tasaritu, i.e. "beginning."  </p>
Tithe	<p>a tenth of the produce of the earth consecrated and set apart for special purposes. The dedication of a tenth to God was recognized as a duty before the time of Moses. Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek ( Genesis 14:20 ;  Hebrews 7:6 ); and Jacob vowed unto the Lord and said, "Of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee."  </p><p> The first Mosaic law on this subject is recorded in  Leviticus 27:30-32 . Subsequent legislation regulated the destination of the tithes ( Numbers 18:21-24 Numbers 18:26-28 ;  Deuteronomy 12:5 Deuteronomy 12:6 Deuteronomy 12:11 Deuteronomy 12:17 ;  Deuteronomy 14:22 Deuteronomy 14:23 ). The paying of the tithes was an important part of the Jewish religious worship. In the days of Hezekiah one of the first results of the reformation of religion was the eagerness with which the people brought in their tithes ( 2 Chronicles 31:5 2 Chronicles 31:6 ). The neglect of this duty was sternly rebuked by the prophets ( Amos 4:4 ;  Malachi 3:8-10 ). It cannot be affirmed that the Old Testament law of tithes is binding on the Christian Church, nevertheless the principle of this law remains, and is incorporated in the gospel ( 1 Corinthians 9:13 1 Corinthians 9:14 ); and if, as is the case, the motive that ought to prompt to liberality in the cause of religion and of the service of God be greater now than in Old Testament times, then Christians outght to go beyond the ancient Hebrew in consecrating both themselves and their substance to God.  </p><p> Every Jew was required by the Levitical law to pay three tithes of his property (1) one tithe for the Levites; (2) one for the use of the temple and the great feasts; and (3) one for the poor of the land.  </p>
Tittle	<p>a point, ( Matthew 5:18 ;  Luke 16:17 ), the minute point or stroke added to some letters of the Hebrew alphabet to distinguish them from others which they resemble; hence, the very least point.  </p>
Titus	<p>honourable, was with Paul and Barnabas at Antioch, and accompanied them to the council at Jerusalem ( Galatians 2:1-3 ;  Acts 15:2 ), although his name nowhere occurs in the Acts of the Apostles. He appears to have been a Gentile, and to have been chiefly engaged in ministering to Gentiles; for Paul sternly refused to have him circumcised, inasmuch as in his case the cause of gospel liberty was at stake. We find him, at a later period, with Paul and Timothy at Ephesus, whence he was sent by Paul to Corinth for the purpose of getting the contributions of the church there in behalf of the poor saints at Jerusalem sent forward ( 2 Corinthians 8:6 ;  12:18 ). He rejoined the apostle when he was in Macedonia, and cheered him with the tidings he brought from Corinth ( 7:6-15 ). After this his name is not mentioned till after Paul's first imprisonment, when we find him engaged in the organization of the church in Crete, where the apostle had left him for this purpose ( Titus 1:5 ). The last notice of him is in  2 Timothy 4:10 , where we find him with Paul at Rome during his second imprisonment. From Rome he was sent into Dalmatia, no doubt on some important missionary errand. We have no record of his death. He is not mentioned in the Acts.  </p>
Titus, Epistle to	<p>was probably written about the same time as the first epistle to Timothy, with which it has many affinities. "Both letters were addressed to persons left by the writer to preside in their respective churches during his absence. Both letters are principally occupied in describing the qualifications to be sought for in those whom they should appoint to offices in the church; and the ingredients of this description are in both letters nearly the same. Timothy and Titus are likewise cautioned against the same prevailing corruptions, and in particular against the same misdirection of their cares and studies. This affinity obtains not only in the subject of the letters, which from the similarity of situation in the persons to whom they were addressed might be expected to be somewhat alike, but extends in a great variety of instances to the phrases and expressions. The writer accosts his two friends with the same salutation, and passes on to the business of his letter by the same transition (Compare 1Tim 1:2,3with  Titus 1:4 Titus 1:5 ; 1Tim.1:4 with  Titus 1:13 Titus 1:14 ;  3:9 ;  1 Timothy 4:12  with  Titus 2:7 Titus 2:15 ).", Paley's Horae Paulinae.  </p><p> The date of its composition may be concluded from the circumstance that it was written after Paul's visit to Crete ( Titus 1:5 ). That visit could not be the one referred to in  Acts 27:7 , when Paul was on his voyage to Rome as a prisoner, and where he continued a prisoner for two years. We may warrantably suppose that after his release Paul sailed from Rome into Asia and took Crete by the way, and that there he left Titus "to set in order the things that were wanting." Thence he went to Ephesus, where he left Timothy, and from Ephesus to Macedonia, where he wrote First Timothy, and thence to Nicopolis in Epirus, from which place he wrote to Titus, about A.D. 66 or 67.  </p><p> In the subscription to the epistle it is said to have been written from "Nicopolis of Macedonia," but no such place is known. The subscriptions to the epistles are of no authority, as they are not authentic. </p>
Tob, The land of	<p>a district on the east of Jodan, about 13 miles south-east of the Sea of Galilee, to which Jephthah fled from his brethren ( Judges 11:3 Judges 11:5 ). It was on the northern boundary of Perea, between Syria and the land of Ammon ( 2 Samuel 10:6 2 Samuel 10:8 ). Its modern name is Taiyibeh.  </p>
Tob-adonijah	<p>good is Jehovah, my Lord, a Levite sent out by Jehoshaphat to instruct the people of Judah in the law ( 2 Chronicles 17:8 ).  </p>
Tobiah	<p>pleasing to Jehovah, the "servant," the "Ammonite," who joined with those who opposed the rebuilding of Jerusalem after the Exile ( Nehemiah 2:10 ). He was a man of great influence, which he exerted in opposition to the Jews, and "sent letters" to Nehemiah "to put him in fear" ( Nehemiah 6:17-19 ). "Eliashib the priest" prepared for him during Nehemiah's absence "a chamber in the courts of the house of God," which on his return grieved Nehemiah sore, and therefore he "cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber" ( Nehemiah 13:7 Nehemiah 13:8 ).  </p>
Tobijah	<p>id., a Levite sent out through Judah by Jehoshaphat to teach the people ( 2 Chronicles 17:8 ).  </p>
Tochen	<p>measured, a town of Simeon ( 1 Chronicles 4:32 ).  </p>
Togarmah	<p></p><li> A son of Gomer, and grandson of Japheth ( Genesis 10:3 ).  </li><li> A nation which traded in horses and mules at the fairs of Tyre ( Ezekiel 27:14 ;  38:6 ); probably an Armenian or a Scythian race; descendants of (1).   </li>
Tohu	<p>one of Samuel's ancestors ( 1 Samuel 1:1 ).  </p>
Toi	<p>a king of Hamath, who sent "Joram his son unto King David to salute him," when he "heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer" ( 2 Samuel 8:9 2 Samuel 8:10 ). Called Tou ( 1 Chronicles 18:9 1 Chronicles 18:10 ).  </p>
Tola	<p>a scarlet worm. </p><li> Eldest son of Issachar ( Genesis 46:13 ).  </li><li> A judge of the tribe of Issachar who "judged" Israel twenty-three years ( Judges 10:1 Judges 10:2 ), when he died, and was buried in Shamir. He was succeeded by Jair.   </li>
Tolad	<p>productive, a town of Simeon, in the south of Judah ( 1 Chronicles 4:29 ).  </p>
Tolaites	<p>descendants of Tola ( Numbers 26:23 ;  1 Chronicles 7:1 1 Chronicles 7:2 ).  </p>
Toll	<p>one of the branches of the king of Persia's revenues ( Ezra 4:13 ;  7:24 ), probably a tax levied from those who used the bridges and fords and highways.  </p>
Tombs	<p>of the Hebrews were generally excavated in the solid rock, or were natural caves. Mention is made of such tombs in  Judges 8:32 ;  2 Sam  2:32 ;  2 Kings  9:28 ;  23:30 . They were sometimes made in gardens ( 2 Kings 21:26 ;  23:16 ;  Matthew 27:60 ). They are found in great numbers in and around Jerusalem and all over the land. They were sometimes whitewashed ( Matthew 23:27 Matthew 23:29 ). The body of Jesus was laid in Joseph's new rock-hewn tomb, in a garden near to Calvary. All evidence is in favour of the opinion that this tomb was somewhere near the Damascus gate, and outside the city, and cannot be identified with the so-called "holy sepulchre." The mouth of such rocky tombs was usually closed by a large stone (Heb. golal), which could only be removed by the united efforts of several men ( Matthew 28:2 ; Compare  John 11:39 ). (See GOLGOTHA .) </p>
Tongues, Confusion of	<p>at Babel, the cause of the early separation of mankind and their division into nations. The descendants of Noah built a tower to prevent their dispersion; but God "confounded their language" ( Genesis 11:1-8 ), and they were scattered over the whole earth. Till this time "the whole earth was of one language and of one speech." (See SHINAR .) </p>
Tongues, Gift of	<p>granted on the day of Pentecost ( Acts 2:4 ), in fulfilment of a promise Christ had made to his disciples ( Mark 16:17 ). What this gift actually was has been a subject of much discussion. Some have argued that it was merely an outward sign of the presence of the Holy Spirit among the disciples, typifying his manifold gifts, and showing that salvation was to be extended to all nations. But the words of Luke ( Acts 2:9 ) clearly show that the various peoples in Jerusalem at the time of Pentecost did really hear themselves addressed in their own special language with which they were naturally acquainted (Compare  Joel 2:28 Joel 2:29 ).  </p><p> Among the gifts of the Spirit the apostle enumerates in  1 Corinthians 12:10-14:30, , "divers kinds of tongues" and the "interpretation of tongues." This "gift" was a different manifestation of the Spirit from that on Pentecost, although it resembled it in many particulars. Tongues were to be "a sign to them that believe not."  </p>
Tooth	<p>one of the particulars regarding which retaliatory punishment was to be inflicted ( Exodus 21:24 ;  Leviticus 24:20 ;  Deuteronomy 19:21 ). "Gnashing of teeth" =rage, despair ( Matthew 8:12 ;  Acts 7:54 ); "cleanness of teeth" =famine ( Amos 4:6 ); "children's teeth set on edge" =children suffering for the sins of their fathers ( Ezekiel 18:2 ).  </p>
Topaz	<p>Heb. pitdah ( Ezekiel 28:13 ;  Revelation 21:20 ), a golden yellow or "green" stone brought from Cush or Ethiopia ( Job 28:19 ). It was the second stone in the first row in the breastplate of the high priest, and had the name of Simeon inscribed on it ( Exodus 28:17 ). It is probably the chrysolite of the moderns.  </p>
Tophel	<p>lime, a place in the wilderness of Sinai ( Deuteronomy 1:1 ), now identified with Tafyleh or Tufileh, on the west side of the Edomitish mountains.  </p>
Tophet	<p>=Topheth, from Heb. toph "a drum," because the cries of children here sacrificed by the priests of Moloch were drowned by the noise of such an instrument; or from taph or toph, meaning "to burn," and hence a place of burning, the name of a particular part in the valley of Hinnom. "Fire being the most destructive of all elements, is chosen by the sacred writers to symbolize the agency by which God punishes or destroys the wicked. We are not to assume from prophetical figures that material fire is the precise agent to be used. It was not the agency employed in the destruction of Sennacherib, mentioned in Isa 30:33...Tophet properly begins where the Vale of Hinnom bends round to the east, having the cliffs of Zion on the north, and the Hill of Evil Counsel on the south. It terminates at Beer 'Ayub, where it joins the Valley of Jehoshaphat. The cliffs on the southern side especially abound in ancient tombs. Here the dead carcasses of beasts and every offal and abomination were cast, and left to be either devoured by that worm that never died or consumed by that fire that was never quenched." Thus Tophet came to represent the place of punishment. (See HINNOM .) </p>
Torches	<p>On the night of his betrayal, when our Lord was in the garden of Gethsemane, Judas, "having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons" ( John 18:1-3 ). Although it was the time of full moon, yet in the valley of the Kidron "there fell great, deep shadows from the declivity of the mountain and projecting rocks; there were there caverns and grottos, into which a fugitive might retreat; finally, there were probably a garden-house and tower, into whose gloom it might be necessary for a searcher to throw light around." Lange's Commentary. ( Nahum 2:3 , "torches," Revised Version, "steel," probably should be "scythes" for war-chariots.)  </p>
Torment	<p>Gr. basanos ( Matthew 4:24 ), the "touch-stone" of justice; hence inquisition by torture, and then any disease which racks and tortures the limbs.  </p>
Tortoise	<p>(Heb. tsabh). Ranked among the unclean animals ( Leviticus 11:29 ). Land tortoises are common in Syria. The LXX. renders the word by "land crocodile." The word, however, more probably denotes a lizard, called by the modern Arabs <i> dhabb</i> . </p>
Tow	<p>( Judges 16:9 ). See FLAX . </p>
Tower of the furnaces	<p>( Nehemiah 3:11 ;  12:38 ), a tower at the north-western angle of the second wall of Jerusalem. It was probably so named from its contiguity to the "bakers' street" ( Jeremiah 37:21 ).  </p>
Towers	<p>of Babel ( Genesis 11:4 ), Edar ( Genesis 35:21 ), Penuel ( Judges 8:9 Judges 8:17 ), Shechem ( 9:46 ), David (Cant  4:4 ), Lebanon ( 7:4 ), Syene (Ezek.  <span class="badLink">29:10</span> ), Hananeel ( Zechariah 14:10 ), Siloam ( Luke 13:4 ). There were several towers in Jerusalem ( 2 Chronicles 26:9 ;  Psalms 48:12 ). They were erected for various purposes, as watch-towers in vineyard ( Isaiah 5:2 ;  Matthew 21:33 ) and towers for defence.  </p>
Trachonitis	<p>a rugged region, corresponds to the Heb. Argob (q.v.), the Greek name of a region on the east of Jordan ( Luke 3:1 ); one of the five Roman provinces into which that district was divided. It was in the tetrarchy of Philip, and is now called the Lejah.  </p>
Tradition	<p>any kind of teaching, written or spoken, handed down from generation to generation. In  Mark 7:3 Mark 7:9 Mark 7:13 ,  Colossians 2:8 , this word refers to the arbitrary interpretations of the Jews. In  2 Thessalonians 2:15 ;  3:6 , it is used in a good sense. Peter ( 1 Peter 1:18 ) uses this word with reference to the degenerate Judaism of the "strangers scattered" whom he addresses (Compare  Acts 15:10 ;  Matthew 15:2-6 ;  Galatians 1:14 ).  </p>
Trance	<p>(Gr. ekstasis, from which the word "ecstasy" is derived) denotes the state of one who is "out of himself." Such were the trances of Peter and Paul,  Acts 10:10 ;  11:5 ;  22:17 , ecstasies, "a preternatural, absorbed state of mind preparing for the reception of the vision", (Compare  2 Corinthians 12:1-4 ). In  Mark 5:42  and  Luke 5:26  the Greek word is rendered "astonishment," "amazement" (Compare  Mark 16:8 ;  Acts 3:10 ).  </p>
Transfiguration, the	<p>of our Lord on a "high mountain apart," is described by each of the three evangelists ( Matthew 17:1-8 ;  Mark 9:2-8 ;  Luke 9:28-36 ). The fullest account is given by Luke, who, no doubt, was informed by Peter, who was present on the occasion. What these evangelists record was an absolute historical reality, and not a mere vision. The concurrence between them in all the circumstances of the incident is exact. John seems to allude to it also ( John 1:14 ). Forty years after the event Peter distinctly makes mention of it ( 2 Peter 1:16-18 ). In describing the sanctification of believers, Paul also seems to allude to this majestic and glorious appearance of our Lord on the "holy mount" ( Romans 12:2 ;  2 co  3:18 ).  </p><p> The place of the transfiguration was probably Mount Hermon (q.v.), and not Mount Tabor, as is commonly supposed. </p>
Treasure cities	<p>store cities which the Israelites built for the Egyptians ( Exodus 1:11 ). (See PITHOM .) Towns in which the treasures of the kings of Judah were kept were so designated ( 1 Chronicles 27:25 ).  </p>
Treasure houses	<p>the houses or magazines built for the safe keeping of treasure and valuable articles of any kind ( Ezra 5:17 ;  7:20 ;  Nehemiah 10:38 ;  Daniel 1:2 ).  </p>
Treasury	<p>( Matthew 27:6 ;  Mark 12:41 ;  John 8:20 ). It does not appear that there was a separate building so called. The name was given to the thirteen brazen chests, called "trumpets," from the form of the opening into which the offerings of the temple worshippers were put. These stood in the outer "court of the women." "Nine chests were for the appointed money-tribute and for the sacrifice-tribute, i.e., money-gifts instead of the sacrifices; four chests for freewill-offerings for wood, incense, temple decoration, and burnt-offerings" (Lightfoot's Hor. Heb.).  </p>
Tree of life	<p>stood also in the midst of the garden of Eden ( Genesis 2:9 ;  3:22 ). Some writers have advanced the opinion that this tree had some secret virtue, which was fitted to preserve life. Probably the lesson conveyed was that life was to be sought by man, not in himself or in his own power, but from without, from Him who is emphatically the Life ( John 1:4 ;  14:6 ). Wisdom is compared to the tree of life ( Proverbs 3:18 ). The "tree of life" spoken of in the Book of Revelation ( Revelation 2:7 ;  Revelation 22:2 Revelation 22:14 ) is an emblem of the joys of the celestial paradise.  </p>[J] indicates this entry was also found in Jack Van Impe's Prophecy Dictionary<br/>
Tree of the knowledge of good and evil	<p>stood in the midst of the garden of Eden, beside the tree of life ( Genesis 23 ,3). Adam and Eve were forbidden to take of the fruit which grew upon it. But they disobeyed the divine injunction, and so sin and death by sin entered our world and became the heritage of Adam's posterity. (See ADAM .) </p>
Trespass offering	<p>(Heb. 'asham, "debt"), the law concerning, given in  Leviticus 5:14-6:7; ; also in  Numbers 5:5-8 . The idea of sin as a "debt" pervades this legislation. The <i> asham</i> , which was always a ram, was offered in cases where sins were more private. (See OFFERING .) </p>
Tribe	<p>a collection of families descending from one ancestor. The "twelve tribes" of the Hebrews were the twelve collections of families which sprang from the sons of Jacob. In  Matthew 24:30  the word has a wider significance. The tribes of Israel are referred to as types of the spiritual family of God ( Revelation 7 ). (See ISRAEL, KINGDOM OF; JUDAH, KINGDOM  OF .) </p>
Tribulation	<p>trouble or affiction of any kind ( Deuteronomy 4:30 ;  Matthew 13:21 ;  2 co  7:4 ). In  Romans 2:9  "tribulation and anguish" are the penal sufferings that shall overtake the wicked. In  Matthew 24:21 Matthew 24:29 , the word denotes the calamities that were to attend the destruction of Jerusalem.  </p>
Tribute	<p>a tax imposed by a king on his subjects ( 2 Samuel 20:24 ;  1 Kings 4:6 ;  Romans 13:6 ). In  Matthew 17:24-27  the word denotes the temple rate (the "didrachma," the "half-shekel," as rendered by the RSV) which was required to be paid for the support of the temple by every Jew above twenty years of age ( Exodus 30:12 ;  2 Kings  12:4 ;  2 Chr  Exodus 24:6 Exodus 24:9 ). It was not a civil but a religious tax.  </p><p> In  Matthew 22:17 ,  Mark 12:14 ,  Luke 20:22 , the word may be interpreted as denoting the capitation tax which the Romans imposed on the Jewish people. It may, however, be legitimately regarded as denoting any tax whatever imposed by a foreign power on the people of Israel. The "tribute money" shown to our Lord ( Matthew 22:19 ) was the denarius, bearing Caesar's superscription. It was the tax paid by every Jew to the Romans. (See PENNY .) </p>
Trinity	<p>a word not found in Scripture, but used to express the doctrine of the unity of God as subsisting in three distinct Persons. This word is derived from the Gr. trias, first used by Theophilus (A.D. 168-183), or from the Lat. trinitas, first used by Tertullian (A.D. 220), to express this doctrine. The propositions involved in the doctrine are these: 1. That God is one, and that there is but one God ( Deuteronomy 6:4 ;  1 Kings 8:60 ;  Isaiah 44:6 ;  Mark 12:29 Mark 12:32 ;  John 10:30 ).  2 . That the Father is a distinct divine Person (hypostasis, subsistentia, persona, suppositum intellectuale), distinct from the Son and the Holy Spirit. 3. That Jesus Christ was truly God, and yet was a Person distinct from the Father and the Holy Spirit. 4. That the Holy Spirit is also a distinct divine Person.  </p>
Troas	<p>a city on the coast of Mysia, in the north-west of Asia Minor, named after ancient Troy, which was at some little distance from it (about 4 miles) to the north. Here Paul, on his second missionary journey, saw the vision of a "man of Macedonia," who appeared to him, saying, "Come over, and help us" ( Acts 16:8-11 ). He visited this place also on other occasions, and on one of these visits he left his cloak and some books there ( 2 Corinthians 2:12 ;  2 Tim  4:13 ). The ruins of Troas extend over many miles, the site being now mostly covered with a forest of oak trees. The modern name of the ruins is Eski Stamboul i.e., Old Constantinople.  </p>
Trogyllium	<p>a town on the western coast of Asia Minor, where Paul "tarried" when on his way from Assos to Miletus, on his third missionary journey ( Acts 20:15 ).  </p>
Trophimus	<p>a foster-child, an Ephesian who accompanied Paul during a part of his third missionary journey ( Acts 20:4 ;  21:29 ). He was with Paul in Jerusalem, and the Jews, supposing that the apostle had brought him with him into the temple, raised a tumult which resulted in Paul's imprisonment. (See TEMPLE, HEROD'S.) In writing to Timothy, the apostle says, "Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick" ( 2 Timothy 4:20 ). This must refer to some event not noticed in the Acts.  </p>
Trumpets	<p>were of a great variety of forms, and were made of divers materials. Some were made of silver ( Numbers 10:2 ), and were used only by the priests in announcing the approach of festivals and in giving signals of war. Some were also made of rams' horns ( Joshua 6:8 ). They were blown at special festivals, and to herald the arrival of special seasons ( Leviticus 23:24 ;  25:9 ;  1 Chronicles 15:24 ;  2 Chr  29:27 ;  Psalms 81:3 ;  98:6 ).  </p><p> "Trumpets" are among the symbols used in the Book of Revelation ( Revelation 1:10 ;  8:2 ). (See HORN .) </p>
Trumpets, Feast of	<p>was celebrated at the beginning of the month Tisri, the first month of the civil year. It received its name from the circumstances that the trumpets usually blown at the commencement of each month were on that occasion blown with unusual solemnity ( Leviticus 23:23-25 ;  Numbers 10:10 ;  29:1-6 ). It was one of the seven days of holy convocation. The special design of this feast, which is described in these verses, is not known.  </p>
Truth	<p>Used in various senses in Scripture. In  Proverbs 12:17 Proverbs 12:19 , it denotes that which is opposed to falsehood. In  Isaiah 59:14 Isaiah 59:15 ,  Jeremiah 7:28 , it means fidelity or truthfulness. The doctrine of Christ is called "the truth of the gospel" ( Galatians 2:5 ), "the truth" ( 2 Timothy 3:7 ;  4:4 ). Our Lord says of himself, "I am the way, and the truth" ( John 14:6 ).  </p>
Tryphena and Tryphosa	<p>two female Christians, active workers, whom Paul salutes in his epistle to the ( Romans 16:12 ).  </p>
Tubal	<p></p><li> The fifth son of Japheth ( Genesis 10:2 ).  </li><li> A nation, probably descended from the son of Japheth. It is mentioned by ( Isaiah 66:19 ), along with Javan, and by ( Ezekiel 27:13 ), along with Meshech, among the traders with Tyre, also among the confederates of Gog ( Ezekiel 38:2 Ezekiel 38:3 ;  39:1 ), and with Meshech among the nations which were to be destroyed ( 32:26 ). This nation was probably the Tiberini of the Greek historian Herodotus, a people of the Asiatic highland west of the Upper Euphrates, the southern range of the Caucasus, on the east of the Black Sea.   </li>
Tubal-cain	<p>the son of Lamech and Zillah, "an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron" ( Genesis 4:22 ; RSV, "the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron").  </p>
Turtle, Turtle-dove	<p>Its peculiar peaceful and gentle habit its often referred to in Scripture. A pair was offered in sacrifice by Mary at her purification ( Luke 2:24 ). The pigeon and the turtle-dove were the only birds permitted to be offered in sacrifice ( Leviticus 1:14 ;  5:7 ;  14:22 ;  Leviticus 15:14 Leviticus 15:29 , etc.). The Latin name of this bird, <i> turtur</i> , is derived from its note, and is a repetition of the Hebrew name <i> tor</i> . Three species are found in Palestine, (1) the turtle-dove (Turtur auritus), (2) the collared turtle (T. risorius), and (3) the palm turtle (T. Senegalensis). But it is to the first of these species which the various passages of Scripture refer. It is a migratory bird ( Jeremiah 8:7 ; Cant  Jeremiah 2:11 Jeremiah 2:12 ). "Search the glades and valleys, even by sultry Jordan, at the end of March, and not a turtle-dove is to be seen. Return in the second week of April, and clouds of doves are feeding on the clovers of the plain. They overspread the whole face of the land." "Immediately on its arrival it pours forth from every garden, grove, and wooded hill its melancholy yet soothing ditty unceasingly from early dawn till sunset. It is from its plaintive and continuous note, doubtless, that David, pouring forth his heart's sorrow to God, compares himself to a turtle-dove" ( Psalms 74:19 ).  </p>
Tychicus	<p>chance, an Asiatic Christian, a "faithful minister in the Lord" ( Ephesians 6:21 Ephesians 6:22 ), who, with Trophimus, accompanied Paul on a part of his journey from Macedonia to Jerusalem ( Acts 20:4 ). He is alluded to also in  Colossians 4:7 ,  Titus 3:12 , and  2 Timothy 4:12  as having been with Paul at Rome, whence he sent him to Ephesus, probably for the purpose of building up and encouraging the church there.  </p>
Type	<p>occurs only once in Scripture ( 1 Corinthians 10:11 , A.V. marg.). The Greek word <i> tupos</i> is rendered "print" ( John 20:25 ), "figure" ( Acts 7:43 ;  Romans 5:14 ), "fashion" ( Acts 7:44 ), "manner" ( Acts 23:25 ), "form" ( Romans 6:17 ), "example" or "ensample" ( 1 Corinthians 10:6 1 Corinthians 10:11 ; Phil  3:17 ;  1 Thessalonians 1:7 ;  2 th  3:9 ;  1 Timothy 4:12 ). It properly means a "model" or "pattern" or "mould" into which clay or wax was pressed, that it might take the figure or exact shape of the mould. The word "type" is generally used to denote a resemblance between something present and something future, which is called the "antitype."  </p>
Tyrannus	<p>prince, a Greek rhetorician, in whose "school" at Ephesus Paul disputed daily for the space of two years with those who came to him ( Acts 19:9 ). Some have supposed that he was a Jew, and that his "school" was a private synagogue.  </p>
Tyre	<p>a rock, now es-Sur; an ancient Phoenician city, about 23 miles, in a direct line, north of Acre, and 20 south of Sidon. Sidon was the oldest Phoenician city, but Tyre had a longer and more illustrious history. The commerce of the whole world was gathered into the warehouses of Tyre. "Tyrian merchants were the first who ventured to navigate the Mediterranean waters; and they founded their colonies on the coasts and neighbouring islands of the AEgean Sea, in Greece, on the northern coast of Africa, at Carthage and other places, in Sicily and Corsica, in Spain at Tartessus, and even beyond the pillars of Hercules at Gadeira (Cadiz)" (Driver's Isaiah). In the time of David a friendly alliance was entered into between the Hebrews and the Tyrians, who were long ruled over by their native kings ( 2 Samuel 5:11 ;  1 Kings 5:1 ;  2 Chr  2:3 ).  </p><p> Tyre consisted of two distinct parts, a rocky fortress on the mainland, called "Old Tyre," and the city, built on a small, rocky island about half-a-mile distant from the shore. It was a place of great strength. It was besieged by Shalmaneser, who was assisted by the Phoenicians of the mainland, for five years, and by Nebuchadnezzar (B.C. 586-573) for thirteen years, apparently without success. It afterwards fell under the power of Alexander the Great, after a siege of seven months, but continued to maintain much of its commercial importance till the Christian era. It is referred to in  Matthew 11:21  and  Acts 12:20 . In A.D. 1291 it was taken by the Saracens, and has remained a desolate ruin ever since.  </p><p> "The purple dye of Tyre had a worldwide celebrity on account of the durability of its beautiful tints, and its manufacture proved a source of abundant wealth to the inhabitants of that city." </p><p> Both Tyre and Sidon "were crowded with glass-shops, dyeing and weaving establishments; and among their cunning workmen not the least important class were those who were celebrated for the engraving of precious stones." ( 2 Chronicles 2:7 2 Chronicles 2:14 ).  </p><p> The wickedness and idolatry of this city are frequently denounced by the prophets, and its final destruction predicted ( Isaiah 23:1 ;  Jeremiah 25:22 ; Ezek. 26;  28:1-19 ;  Amos 1:9 Amos 1:10 ;  Zechariah 9:2-4 ).  </p><p> Here a church was founded soon after the death of Stephen, and Paul, on his return from his third missionary journey spent a week in intercourse with the disciples there ( Acts 21:4 ). Here the scene at Miletus was repeated on his leaving them. They all, with their wives and children, accompanied him to the sea-shore. The sea-voyage of the apostle terminated at Ptolemais, about 38 miles from Tyre. Thence he proceeded to Caesarea ( Acts 21:5-8 ).  </p><p> "It is noticed on monuments as early as B.C. 1500, and claiming, according to Herodotus, to have been founded about B.C. 2700. It had two ports still existing, and was of commercial importance in all ages, with colonies at Carthage (about B.C. 850) and all over the Mediterranean. It was often attacked by Egypt and Assyria, and taken by Alexander the Great after a terrible siege in B.C. 332. It is now a town of 3,000 inhabitants, with ancient tombs and a ruined cathedral. A short Phoenician text of the fourth century B.C. is the only monument yet recovered."  </p>
Tyropoeon Valley	<p>(i.e., "Valley of the Cheesemongers"), the name given by Josephus the historian to the valley or rugged ravine which in ancient times separated Mount Moriah from Mount Zion. This valley, now filled up with a vast accumulation of rubbish, and almost a plain, was spanned by bridges, the most noted of which was Zion Bridge, which was probably the ordinary means of communication between the royal palace on Zion and the temple. A fragment of the arch (q.v.) of this bridge (called "Robinson's Arch"), where it projects from the sanctuary wall, was discovered by Robinson in 1839. This arch was destroyed by the Romans when Jerusalem was taken.  </p><p> The western wall of the temple area rose up from the bottom of this valley to the height of 84 feet, where it was on a level with the area, and above this, and as a continuance of it, the wall of Solomon's cloister rose to the height of about 50 feet, "so that this section of the wall would originally present to view a stupendous mass of masonry scarcely to be surpassed by any mural masonry in the world."  </p>
Urim	<p>lights (Vulg."doctrina;" LXX. "revelation"). See THUMMIM . </p>
Usury	<p>the sum paid for the use of money, hence interest; not, as in the modern sense, exorbitant interest. The Jews were forbidden to exact usury ( Leviticus 25:36 Leviticus 25:37 ), only, however, in their dealings with each other ( Deuteronomy 23:19 Deuteronomy 23:20 ). The violation of this law was viewed as a great crime ( Psalms 15:5 ;  Proverbs 28:8 ;  Jeremiah 15:10 ). After the Return, and later, this law was much neglected ( Nehemiah 5:7 Nehemiah 5:10 ).  </p>
Uz	<p>fertile land. </p><li> The son of Aram, and grandson of Shem ( Genesis 10:23 ;  1 Chronicles 1:17 ).  </li><li> One of the Horite "dukes" in the land of Edom ( Genesis 36:28 ).  </li><li> The eldest son of Nahor, Abraham's brother ( Genesis 22:21 , RSV).   </li>
Uz, The land of	<p>where Job lived ( 1:1 ;  Jeremiah 25:20 ;  Lamentations 4:21 ), probably somewhere to the east or south-east of Palestine and north of Edom. It is mentioned in Scripture only in these three passages.  </p>
Uzal	<p>a wanderer, a descendant of Joktan ( Genesis 10:27 ;  1 Chronicles 1:21 ), the founder apparently of one of the Arab tribes; the name also probably of the province they occupied and of their chief city.  </p>
Uzza	<p>strengh, a garden in which Manasseh and Amon were buried ( 2 Kings 21:18 2 Kings 21:26 ). It was probably near the king's palace in Jerusalem, or may have formed part of the palace grounds. Manasseh may probably have acquired it from some one of this name.  </p>
Uzzah	<p>strength, a son of Abinadab, in whose house the men of Kirjath-jearim placed the ark when it was brought back from the land of the Philistines ( 1 Samuel 7:1 ). He with his brother Ahio drove the cart on which the ark was placed when David sought to bring it up to Jerusalem. When the oxen stumbled, Uzzah, in direct violation of the divine law ( Numbers 4:15 ), put forth his hand to steady the ark, and was immediately smitten unto death. The place where this occurred was henceforth called Perez-uzzah ( 1 Chronicles 13:11 ). David on this feared to proceed further, and placed the ark in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite ( 2 Samuel 6:2-11 ;  1 Chronicles 13:6-13 ).  </p>
Uzzen-sherah	<p>a town probably near Beth-horon. It derived its name from the daughter of Ephraim ( 1 Chronicles 7:24 ).  </p>
Uzzi	<p>the Lord is my strength. </p><li> The son of Bukki, and a descendant of Aaron ( 1 Chronicles 6:5 1 Chronicles 6:51 ;  Ezra 7:4 ).  </li><li> A grandson of Issachar ( 1 Chronicles 7:2 1 Chronicles 7:3 ).  </li><li> A son of Bela, and grandson of Benjamin ( 1 Chronicles 7:7 ).  </li><li> A Benjamite, a chief in the tribe ( 1 Chronicles 9:8 ).  </li><li> A son of Bani. He had the oversight of the Levites after the return from captivity ( Nehemiah 11:22 ).  </li><li> The head of the house of Jedaiah, one of "the chief of the priests" ( Nehemiah 12:19 ).  </li><li> A priest who assisted in the dedication of the walls of Jerusalem ( Nehemiah 12:42 ).   </li>
Uzziah	<p>a contracted form of Azari'ah the Lord is my strength. </p><li> One of Amaziah's sons, whom the people made king of Judah in his father's stead ( 2 Kings 14:21 ;  2 Chr  26:1 ). His long reign of about fifty-two years was "the most prosperous excepting that of Jehosaphat since the time of Solomon." He was a vigorous and able ruler, and "his name spread abroad, even to the entering in of Egypt" ( 2 Chronicles 26:8 2 Chronicles 26:14 ). In the earlier part of his reign, under the influence of Zechariah, he was faithful to Jehovah, and "did that which was right in the sight of the Lord" ( 2 Kings 15:3 ;  2 Chr  2 Kings 26:4  2 Kings 26:5 ); but toward the close of his long life "his heart was lifted up to his destruction," and he wantonly invaded the priest's office ( 2 Chronicles 26:16 ), and entering the sanctuary proceeded to offer incense on the golden altar. Azariah the high priest saw the tendency of such a daring act on the part of the king, and with a band of eighty priests he withstood him ( 2 Chronicles 26:17 ), saying, "It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense." Uzziah was suddenly struck with leprosy while in the act of offering incense ( 26:19-21 ), and he was driven from the temple and compelled to reside in "a several house" to the day of his death ( 2 Kings 15:5 2 Kings 15:27 ;  2 Chr  26:3 ). He was buried in a separate grave "in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings" ( 2 Kings 15:7 ;  2 Chr  26:23 ). "That lonely grave in the royal necropolis would eloquently testify to coming generations that all earthly monarchy must bow before the inviolable order of the divine will, and that no interference could be tolerated with that unfolding of the purposes of God, which, in the fulness of time, would reveal the Christ, the true High Priest and King for evermore" (Dr. Green's Kingdom of Israel, etc.).  </li><li> The father of Jehonathan, one of David's overseers ( 1 Chronicles 27:25 ).   </li>
Uzziel	<p>strength of God. </p><li> One of the sons of Kohath, and uncle of Aaron ( Exodus 6:18 ;  Leviticus 10:4 ).  </li><li> A Simeonite captain ( 1 Chronicles 4:39-43 ).  </li><li> A son of Bela, and grandson of Benjamin ( 1 Chronicles 7:7 ).  </li><li> One of the sons of Heman ( 1 Chronicles 25:4 ); called also Azareel (18).  </li><li> A son of Jeduthan ( 2 Chronicles 29:14 ).  </li><li> The son of Harhaiah ( Nehemiah 3:8 ).   </li>
Vine of Sodom	<p>referred to only in  Deuteronomy 32:32 . Among the many conjectures as to this tree, the most probable is that it is the 'osher of the Arabs, which abounds in the region of the Dead Sea. Its fruit are the so-called "apples of Sodom," which, though beautiful to the eye, are exceedingly bitter to the taste. (See EN-GEDI.) The people of Israel are referred to here by Moses as being utterly corrupt, bringing forth only bitter fruit.  </p>
Vinegar	<p>Heb. hometz, Gr. oxos, Fr. vin aigre; i.e., "sour wine." The Hebrew word is rendered vinegar in  Psalms 69:21 , a prophecy fulfilled in the history of the crucifixion ( Matthew 27:34 ). This was the common sour wine (posea) daily made use of by the Roman soldiers. They gave it to Christ, not in derision, but from compassion, to assuage his thirst.  Proverbs 10:26  shows that there was also a stronger vinegar, which was not fit for drinking. The comparison, "vinegar upon nitre," probably means "vinegar upon soda" (as in the marg. of the RSV), which then effervesces.  </p>
Viol	<p>Heb. nebel ( Isaiah 5:12 , RSV, "lute;"  14:11 ), a musical instrument, usually rendered "psaltery" (q.v.)  </p>
Viper	<p>In  Job 20:16 ,  Isaiah 30:6 ;  59:5 , the Heb. word eph'eh is thus rendered. The Hebrew word, however, probably denotes a species of poisonous serpents known by the Arabic name of 'el ephah. Tristram has identified it with the sand viper, a species of small size common in sandy regions, and frequently found under stones by the shores of the Dead Sea. It is rapid in its movements, and highly poisonous. In the New Testament <i> echidne</i> is used ( Matthew 3:7 ;  12:34 ;  23:33 ) for any poisonous snake. The viper mentioned in  Acts 28:3  was probably the vipera aspis, or the Mediterranean viper. (See ADDER .) </p>
Virgin	<p>In a prophecy concerning our Lord, ( Isaiah 7:14 ) says, "A virgin [RSV marg., 'the virgin'] shall conceive, and bear a son" (Compare  Luke 1:31-35 ). The people of the land of Zidon are thus referred to by ( Isaiah 23:12 ), "O thou oppressed virgin, daughter of Zidon;" and of the people of Israel, ( Jeremiah 18:13 ) says, "The virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing."  </p>
Vision	<p>( Luke 1:22 ), a vivid apparition, not a dream (Compare  Luke 24:23 ;  Acts 26:19 ;  2 co  12:1 ).  </p>
Vows	<p>voluntary promises which, when once made, were to be kept if the thing vowed was right. They were made under a great variety of circumstances ( Genesis 28: :  1822 -22;  Leviticus 7:16 ;  Numbers 30:2-13 ;  Deuteronomy 23:18 ;  Judges 11:30 Judges 11:39 ;  1 Samuel 1:11 ;  Jonah 1:16 ;  Acts 18:18 ;  21:23 ).  </p>
Vulture	<p></p><li> Heb. da'ah ( Leviticus 11:14 ). In the parallel passage ( Deuteronomy 14:13 ) the Hebrew word used is <i> ra'ah</i> , rendered "glede;" LXX., "gups;" Vulg., "milvus." A species of ravenous bird, distinguished for its rapid flight. "When used without the epithet 'red,' the name is commonly confined to the black kite. The habits of the bird bear out the allusion in  Isaiah 34:15 , for it is, excepting during the winter three months, so numerous everywhere in Palestine as to be almost gregarious." (See EAGLE .) </li><li> In  Job 28:7  the Heb. 'ayyah is thus rendered. The word denotes a clamorous and a keen-sighted bird of prey. In  Leviticus 11:14  and  Deuteronomy 14:13  it is rendered "kite" (q.v.).   </li>
Wilderness	<p></p><li> Heb. midhbar, denoting not a barren desert but a district or region suitable for pasturing sheep and cattle ( Psalms 65:12 ;  Isaiah 42:11 ;  Jeremiah 23:10 ;  Joel 1:19 ;  2:22 ); an uncultivated place. This word is used of the wilderness of Beersheba ( Genesis 21:14 ), on the southern border of Palestine; the wilderness of the Red Sea ( Exodus 13:18 ); of Shur ( 15:22 ), a portion of the Sinaitic peninsula; of Sin ( 17:1 ), Sinai ( Leviticus 7:38 ), Moab ( Deuteronomy 2:8 ), Judah ( Judges 1:16 ), Ziph, Maon, En-gedi ( 1 Samuel 23:14 1 Samuel 23:24 ;  24:1 ), Jeruel and Tekoa ( 2 Chronicles 20:16 2 Chronicles 20:20 ), Kadesh ( Psalms 29:8 ).  <p> "The wilderness of the sea" ( Isaiah 21:1 ). Principal Douglas, referring to this expression, says: "A mysterious name, which must be meant to describe Babylon (see especially ver. 9), perhaps because it became the place of discipline to God's people, as the wilderness of the Red Sea had been (Compare Ezek.  20:35 ). Otherwise it is in contrast with the symbolic title in  Isaiah 22:1 . Jerusalem is the "valley of vision," rich in spiritual husbandry; whereas Babylon, the rival centre of influence, is spiritually barren and as restless as the sea (comp  57:20 )." A Short Analysis of the O.T.  </p></li><li> Jeshimon, a desert waste ( Deuteronomy 32:10 ;  Psalms 68:7 ).  </li><li> 'Arabah, the name given to the valley from the Dead Sea to the eastern branch of the Red Sea. In  Deuteronomy 1:1 ;  2:8 , it is rendered "plain" (RSV, "Arabah").  </li><li> Tziyyah, a "dry place" ( Psalms 78:17 ;  105:41 ).  </li><li> Tohu, a "desolate" place, a place "waste" or "unoccupied" ( Deuteronomy 32:10 ;  Job 12:24 ; Compare  Genesis 1:2 , "without form"). The wilderness region in the Sinaitic peninsula through which for forty years the Hebrews wandered is generally styled "the wilderness of the wanderings." This entire region is in the form of a triangle, having its base toward the north and its apex toward the south. Its extent from north to south is about 250 miles, and at its widest point it is about 150 miles broad. Throughout this vast region of some 1,500 square miles there is not a single river. The northern part of this triangular peninsula is properly the "wilderness of the wanderings" (et-Tih). The western portion of it is called the "wilderness of Shur" ( Exodus 15:22 ), and the eastern the "wilderness of Paran."  <p> The "wilderness of Judea" ( Matthew 3:1 ) is a wild, barren region, lying between the Dead Sea and the Hebron Mountains. It is the "Jeshimon" mentioned in  1 Samuel 23:19 .  </p> </li>
Willows	<p></p><li> Heb. 'arabim ( Leviticus 23:40 ;  Job 40:22 ;  Isaiah 15:7 ;  Isaiah 44:3 Isaiah 44:4 ;  Psalms 137:1 Psalms 137:2 ). This was supposed to be the weeping willow, called by Linnaeus Salix Babylonica, from the reference in  Psalms 137 . This tree is frequently found "on the coast, overhanging wells and pools. There is a conspicuous tree of this species over a pond in the plain of Acre, and others on the Phoenician plain." There are several species of the salix in Palestine, but it is not indigenous to Babylonia, nor was it cultivated there. Some are of opinion that the tree intended is the tamarisk or poplar.  </li><li> Heb. tzaphtzaphah ( Ezekiel 17:5 ), called by the Arabs the safsaf, the general name for the willow. This may be the Salix AEgyptica of naturalists.  <p> Tristram thinks that by the "willow by the water-courses," the Nerium oleander, the rose-bay oleander, is meant. He says, "It fringes the Upper Jordan, dipping its wavy crown of red into the spray in the rapids under Hermon, and is nutured by the oozy marshes in the Lower Jordan nearly as far as to Jericho...On the Arnon, on the Jabbok, and the Yarmuk it forms a continuous fringe. In many of the streams of Moab it forms a complete screen, which the sun's rays can never penetrate to evaporate the precious moisture. The wild boar lies safely ensconced under its impervious cover." </p> </li>
Wimple	<p> Isaiah 3:22 , (RSV, "shawls"), a wrap or veil. The same Hebrew word is rendered "vail" (RSV, "mantle") in  Ruth 3:15 .  </p>
Window	<p>properly only an opening in a house for the admission of light and air, covered with lattice-work, which might be opened or closed ( 2 Kings 1:2 ;  Acts 20:9 ). The spies in Jericho and Paul at Damascus were let down from the windows of houses abutting on the town wall ( Joshua 2:15 ;  2 co  11:33 ). The clouds are metaphorically called the "windows of heaven" ( Genesis 7:11 ;  Malachi 3:10 ). The word thus rendered in  Isaiah 54:12  ought rather to be rendered "battlements" (LXX., "bulwarks;" RSV, "pinnacles"), or as Gesenius renders it, "notched battlements, i.e., suns or rays of the sun"= having a radiated appearance like the sun.  </p>
Winds	<p>blowing from the four quarters of heaven ( Jeremiah 49:36 ; Ezek.  37:9 ;  Daniel 8:8 ;  Zechariah 2:6 ). The east wind was parching (Ezek.  17:10 ;  19:12 ), and is sometimes mentioned as simply denoting a strong wind ( Job 27:21 ;  Isaiah 27:8 ). This wind prevails in Palestine from February to June, as the west wind ( Luke 12:54 ) does from November to February. The south was a hot wind ( Job 37:17 ;  Luke 12:55 ). It swept over the Arabian peninsula. The rush of invaders is figuratively spoken of as a whirlwind ( Isaiah 21:1 ); a commotion among the nations of the world as a striving of the four winds ( Daniel 7:2 ). The winds are subject to the divine power ( Psalms 18:10 ;  135:7 ).  </p>
Wine	<p>The common Hebrew word for wine is <i> yayin</i> , from a root meaning "to boil up," "to be in a ferment." Others derive it from a root meaning "to tread out," and hence the juice of the grape trodden out. The Greek word for wine is <i> oinos_, and the Latin _vinun</i> . But besides this common Hebrew word, there are several others which are thus rendered. </p><li> Ashishah ( 2 Samuel 6:19 ;  1 Chronicles 16:3 ; Cant  2:5 ;  Hosea 3:1 ), which, however, rather denotes a solid cake of pressed grapes, or, as in the Revised Version, a cake of raisins.  </li><li> 'Asis, "sweet wine," or "new wine," the product of the same year (Cant  8:2 ;  Isaiah 49:26 ;  Joel 1:5 ;  3:18 ;  Amos 9:13 ), from a root meaning "to tread," hence juice trodden out or pressed out, thus referring to the method by which the juice is obtained. The power of intoxication is ascribed to it.  </li><li> Hometz. See VINEGAR . </li><li> Hemer,  Deuteronomy 32:14  (rendered "blood of the grape")  Isaiah 27:2  ("red wine"),  Ezra 6:9 ;  7:22 ;  Daniel 5:1 Daniel 5:2 Daniel 5:4 . This word conveys the idea of "foaming," as in the process of fermentation, or when poured out. It is derived from the root <i> hamar</i> , meaning "to boil up," and also "to be red," from the idea of boiling or becoming inflamed. </li><li> 'Enabh, a grape ( Deuteronomy 32:14 ). The last clause of this verse should be rendered as in the Revised Version, "and of the blood of the grape ['enabh] thou drankest wine [hemer]." In  Hosea 3:1  the phrase in Authorized Version, "flagons of wine," is in the Revised Version correctly "cakes of raisins." (Compare  Genesis 49:11 ;  Numbers 6:3 ;  Deuteronomy 23:24 , etc., where this Hebrew word is rendered in the plural "grapes.")  </li><li> Mesekh, properly a mixture of wine and water with spices that increase its stimulating properties ( Isaiah 5:22 ).  Psalms 75:8 , "The wine [yayin] is red; it is full of mixture [mesekh];"  Proverbs 23:30 , "mixed wine;"  Isaiah 65:11 , "drink offering" (RSV, "mingled wine").  </li><li> Tirosh, properly "must," translated "wine" ( Deuteronomy 28:51 ); "new wine" ( Proverbs 3:10 ); "sweet wine" ( Micah 6:15 ; RSV, "vintage"). This Hebrew word has been traced to a root meaning "to take possession of" and hence it is supposed that tirosh is so designated because in intoxicating it takes possession of the brain. Among the blessings promised to Esau ( Genesis 27:28 ) mention is made of "plenty of corn and tirosh." Palestine is called "a land of corn and tirosh" ( Deuteronomy 33:28 ; Compare  Isaiah 36:17 ). See also  Deuteronomy 28:51 ;  2 Chr  32:28 ;  Joel 2:19 ;  Hosea 4:11 , ("wine [yayin] and new wine [tirosh] take away the heart").  </li><li> Sobhe (root meaning "to drink to excess," "to suck up," "absorb"), found only in  Isaiah 1:22 ,  Hosea 4:18  ("their drink;" Gesen. and marg. of RSV, "their carouse"), and  Nahum 1:10  ("drunken as drunkards;" lit., "soaked according to their drink;" RSV, "drenched, as it were, in their drink", i.e., according to their sobhe).  </li><li> Shekar, "strong drink," any intoxicating liquor; from a root meaning "to drink deeply," "to be drunken", a generic term applied to all fermented liquors, however obtained.  Numbers 28:7 , "strong wine" (RSV, "strong drink"). It is sometimes distinguished from wine, c.g.,  Leviticus 10:9 , "Do not drink wine [yayin] nor strong drink [shekar];"  Numbers 6:3 ;  Judges 13:4 Judges 13:7 ;  Isaiah 28:7  (in all these places rendered "strong drink"). Translated "strong drink" also in  Isaiah 5:11 ;  24:9 ;  29:9 ;  56:12 ;  Proverbs 20:1 ;  31:6 ;  Micah 2:11 .  </li><li> Yekebh ( Deuteronomy 16:13 , but in RSV correctly "wine-press"), a vat into which the new wine flowed from the press.  Joel 2:24 , "their vats;"  3:13 , "the fats;"  Proverbs 3:10 , "Thy presses shall burst out with new wine [tirosh];"  Haggai 2:16 ;  Jeremiah 48:33 , "wine-presses;"  2 Kings 6:27 ;  Job 24:11 .  </li><li> Shemarim (only in plural), "lees" or "dregs" of wine. In  Isaiah 25:6  it is rendered "wines on the lees", i.e., wine that has been kept on the lees, and therefore old wine.  </li><li> Mesek, "a mixture," mixed or spiced wine, not diluted with water, but mixed with drugs and spices to increase its strength, or, as some think, mingled with the lees by being shaken ( Psalms 75:8 ;  Proverbs 23:30 ).  <p> In  Acts 2:13  the word <i> gleukos</i> , rendered "new wine," denotes properly "sweet wine." It must have been intoxicating. </p><p> In addition to wine the Hebrews also made use of what they called <i> debash</i> , which was obtained by boiling down must to one-half or one-third of its original bulk. In  Genesis 43:11  this word is rendered "honey." It was a kind of syrup, and is called by the Arabs at the present day dibs. This word occurs in the phrase "a land flowing with milk and honey" (debash),  Exodus 3:8 Exodus 3:17 ;  13:5 ;  33:3 ;  Leviticus 20:24 ;  Numbers 13: :  27 . (See HONEY .) </p><p> Our Lord miraculously supplied wine at the marriage feast in Cana of Galilee ( John 2:1-11 ). The Rechabites were forbidden the use of wine ( Jeremiah 35 ). The Nazarites also were to abstain from its use during the period of their vow ( Numbers 6:1-4 ); and those who were dedicated as Nazarites from their birth were perpetually to abstain from it ( Judges 13:4 Judges 13:5 ;  Luke 1:15 ;  7:33 ). The priests, too, were forbidden the use of wine and strong drink when engaged in their sacred functions ( Leviticus 10:1 Leviticus 10:9-11 ). "Wine is little used now in the East, from the fact that Mohammedans are not allowed to taste it, and very few of other creeds touch it. When it is drunk, water is generally mixed with it, and this was the custom in the days of Christ also. The people indeed are everywhere very sober in hot climates; a drunken person, in fact, is never seen", (Geikie's Life of Christ). The sin of drunkenness, however, must have been not uncommon in the olden times, for it is mentioned either metaphorically or literally more than seventy times in the Bible.  </p><p> A drink-offering of wine was presented with the daily sacrifice ( Exodus 29:40 Exodus 29:41 ), and also with the offering of the first-fruits ( Leviticus 23:13 ), and with various other sacrifices ( Numbers 15:5 Numbers 15:7 Numbers 15:10 ). Wine was used at the celebration of the Passover. And when the Lord's Supper was instituted, the wine and the unleavened bread then on the paschal table were by our Lord set apart as memorials of his body and blood.  </p><p> Several emphatic warnings are given in the New Testament against excess in the use of wine ( Luke 21:34 ;  Romans 13:13 ;  Ephesians 5:18 ;  1 Timothy 3:8 ;  Titus 1:7 ).  </p> </li>
Winefat	<p>( Mark 12:1 ). The original word (hypolenion) so rendered occurs only here in the New Testament. It properly denotes the trough or lake (lacus), as it was called by the Romans, into which the juice of the grapes ran from the trough above it. It is here used, however, of the whole apparatus. In the parallel passage in  Matthew 21:33  the Greek word <i> lenos</i> is used. This properly denotes the upper one of the two vats. (See WINE-PRESS.) </p>
Wine-press	<p>Consisted of two vats or receptacles, (1) a trough (Heb. gath, Gr. lenos) into which the grapes were thrown and where they were trodden upon and bruised ( Isaiah 16:10 ;  Lamentations 1:15 ;  Joel 3:13 ); and (2) a trough or vat (Heb. yekebh, Gr. hypolenion) into which the juice ran from the trough above, the gath ( Nehemiah 13:15 ;  Job 24:11 ;  Isaiah 63:2 Isaiah 63:3 ;  Haggai 2:16 ;  Joel 2:24 ). Wine-presses are found in almost every part of Palestine. They are "the only sure relics we have of the old days of Israel before the Captivity. Between Hebron and Beersheba they are found on all the hill slopes; they abound in southern Judea; they are no less common in the many valleys of Carmel; and they are numerous in Galilee." The "treading of the wine-press" is emblematic of divine judgment ( Isaiah 63:2 ;  Lamentations 1:15 ;  Revelation 14:19 Revelation 14:20 ).  </p>
Winnow	<p>Corn was winnowed, </p><li> By being thrown up by a shovel against the wind. As a rule this was done in the evening or during the night, when the west wind from the sea was blowing, which was a moderate breeze and fitted for the purpose. The north wind was too strong, and the east wind came in gusts. </li><li> By the use of a fan or van, by which the chaff was blown away ( Ruth 3:2 ;  Isaiah 30:24 ;  Jeremiah 4:11 Jeremiah 4:12 ;  Matthew 3:12 ).   </li>
Wise men	<p>mentioned in  Daniel 2:12  included three classes, (1) astrologers, (2) Chaldeans, and (3) soothsayers. The word in the original (hakamim) probably means "medicine men. In Chaldea medicine was only a branch of magic. The "wise men" of  Matthew 2:7 , who came from the East to Jerusalem, were magi from Persia or Arabia.  </p>
Wise, wisdom	<p>a moral rather than an intellectual quality. To be "foolish" is to be godless ( Psalms 14:1 ; Compare  Judges 19:23 ;  2 Sam  13:13 ). True wisdom is a gift from God to those who ask it ( Job 28:12-28 ;  Proverbs 3:13-18 ;  Romans 1:22 ;  16:27 ;  1 Corinthians 1:17-21 ;  2:6-8 ;  James 1:5 ). "Wisdom" in  Proverbs 1:20 ;  8:1 ;  9:1-5  may be regarded not as a mere personification of the attribute of wisdom, but as a divine person, "Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God" ( 1 Corinthians 1:24 ). In  Matthew 11:19  it is the personified principle of wisdom that is meant.  </p>
Witch	<p>Occurs only in  Exodus 22:18 , as the rendering of <i> mekhashshepheh</i> , the feminine form of the word, meaning "enchantress" (RSV, "sorceress"), and in  Deuteronomy 18:10 , as the rendering of <i> mekhashshepheth</i> , the masculine form of the word, meaning "enchanter." </p>
Witchcraft	<p>( 1 Samuel 15:23 ;  2 Kings  9:22 ;  2 Chr  <span class="badLink">33:6</span> ;  Micah 5:12 ;  Nahum 3:4 ;  Galatians 5:20 ). In the popular sense of the word no mention is made either of witches or of witchcraft in Scripture.  </p><p> The "witch of En-dor" ( 1 Samuel 28 ) was a necromancer, i.e., one who feigned to hold converse with the dead. The damsel with "a spirit of divination" ( Acts 16:16 ) was possessed by an evil spirit, or, as the words are literally rendered, "having a spirit, a pithon." The reference is to the heathen god Apollo, who was regarded as the god of prophecy.  </p>
Witness	<p>More than one witness was required in criminal cases ( Deuteronomy 17:6 ;  19:15 ). They were the first to execute the sentence on the condemned ( Deuteronomy 13:9 ;  17:7 ;  1 Kings 21:13 ;  Matthew 27:1 ;  Acts 7:57 Acts 7:58 ). False witnesses were liable to punishment ( Deuteronomy 19:16-21 ). It was also an offence to refuse to bear witness ( Leviticus 5:1 ).  </p>
Witness of the Spirit	<p>( Romans 8:16 ), the consciousness of the gracious operation of the Spirit on the mind, "a certitude of the Spirit's presence and work continually asserted within us", manifested "in his comforting us, his stirring us up to prayer, his reproof of our sins, his drawing us to works of love, to bear testimony before the world," etc.  </p>
Wizard	<p>a pretender to supernatural knowledge and power, "a knowing one," as the original Hebrew word signifies. Such an one was forbidden on pain of death to practise his deceptions ( Leviticus 19:31 ;  Leviticus 20:6 Leviticus 20:27 ;  1 Samuel 28:3 ;  Isaiah 8:19 ;  19:3 ).  </p>
Wolf	<p>Heb. zeeb, frequently referred to in Scripture as an emblem of treachery and cruelty. Jacob's prophecy, "Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf" ( Genesis 49:27 ), represents the warlike character of that tribe (see Judg. 19-21). Isaiah represents the peace of Messiah's kingdom by the words, "The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb" ( Isaiah 11:6 ). The habits of the wolf are described in  Jeremiah 5:6 ;  Habakkuk 1:8 ;  Zephaniah 3:3 ;  Ezekiel 22:27 ;  Matthew 7:15 ;  10:16 ;  Acts 20:29 . Wolves are still sometimes found in Palestine, and are the dread of shepherds, as of old.  </p>
Woman	<p>was "taken out of man" ( Genesis 2:23 ), and therefore the man has the preeminence. "The head of the woman is the man;" but yet honour is to be shown to the wife, "as unto the weaker vessel" ( 1 Corinthians 11:3 1 Corinthians 11:8 1 Corinthians 11:9 ;  1 Peter 3:7 ). Several women are mentioned in Scripture as having been endowed with prophetic gifts, as Miriam ( Exodus 15:20 ), Deborah ( Judges 4:4 Judges 4:5 ), Huldah ( 2 Kings 22:14 ), Noadiah ( Nehemiah 6:14 ), Anna ( Luke 2:36 Luke 2:37 ), and the daughters of Philip the evangelist ( Acts 21:8 Acts 21:9 ). Women are forbidden to teach publicly ( 1 Corinthians 14:34 1 Corinthians 14:35 ;  1 Timothy 2:11 1 Timothy 2:12 ). Among the Hebrews it devolved upon women to prepare the meals for the household ( Genesis 18:6 ;  2 Sam  13:8 ), to attend to the work of spinning ( Exodus 35:26 ;  Proverbs 31:19 ), and making clothes ( 1 Samuel 2:19 ;  Proverbs 31:21 ), to bring water from the well ( Genesis 24:15 ;  1 Samuel 9:11 ), and to care for the flocks ( Genesis 29:6 ;  Exodus 2:16 ).  </p><p> The word "woman," as used in  Matthew 15:28 ,  John 2:4  and  John 20:13 John 20:15 , implies tenderness and courtesy and not disrespect. Only where revelation is known has woman her due place of honour assigned to her.  </p>
Wood	<p>See FOREST . </p>
Wood-offering	<p>( Nehemiah 10:34 ;  13:31 ). It would seem that in the time of Nehemiah arrangements were made, probably on account of the comparative scarcity of wood, by which certain districts were required, as chosen by lot, to furnish wood to keep the altar fire perpetually burning ( Leviticus 6:13 ).  </p>
Wool	<p>one of the first material used for making woven cloth ( Leviticus 13:47 Leviticus 13:48 Leviticus 13:52 Leviticus 13:59 ;  19:19 ). The first-fruit of wool was to be offered to the priests ( Deuteronomy 18:4 ). The law prohibiting the wearing of a garment "of divers sorts, as of woollen and linen together" ( Deuteronomy 22:11 ) may, like some other laws of a similar character, have been intended to express symbolically the separateness and simplicity of God's covenant people. The wool of Damascus, famous for its whiteness, was of great repute in the Tyrian market ( Ezekiel 27:18 ).  </p>
Word of God	<p>( Hebrews 4:12 , etc.). The Bible so called because the writers of its several books were God's organs in communicating his will to men. It is his "word," because he speaks to us in its sacred pages. Whatever the inspired writers here declare to be true and binding upon us, God declares to be true and binding. This word is infallible, because written under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, and therefore free from all error of fact or doctrine or precept. (See INSPIRATION;  BIBLE .) All saving knowledge is obtained from the word of God. In the case of adults it is an indispensable means of salvation, and is efficacious thereunto by the gracious influence of the Holy Spirit ( John 17:17 ;  2 Tim  John 3:15 John 3:16 ;  1 Peter 1:23 ).  </p>
Word, The	<p>(Gr. Logos), one of the titles of our Lord, found only in the writings of John ( John 1:1-14 ;  1 John 1:1 ;  Revelation 19:13 ). As such, Christ is the revealer of God. His office is to make God known. "No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him" ( John 1:18 ). This title designates the divine nature of Christ. As the Word, he "was in the beginning" and "became flesh." "The Word was with God " and "was God," and was the Creator of all things (Compare Ps.33: 6;  107:20 ;  119:89 ;  147:18 ;  Isaiah 40:8 ).  </p>
Works, Covenant of	<p>entered into by God with Adam as the representative of the human race (Compare  Genesis 9:11 Genesis 9:12 ;  17:1-21 ), so styled because perfect obedience was its condition, thus distinguishing it from the covenant of grace. (See COVENANT OF  WORKS .) </p>
Works, Good	<p>The old objection against the doctrine of salvation by grace, that it does away with the necessity of good works, and lowers the sense of their importance ( Romans 6 ), although it has been answered a thousand times, is still alleged by many. They say if men are not saved by works, then works are not necessary. If the most moral of men are saved in the same way as the very chief of sinners, then good works are of no moment. And more than this, if the grace of God is most clearly displayed in the salvation of the vilest of men, then the worse men are the better.  </p><p> The objection has no validity. The gospel of salvation by grace shows that good works are necessary. It is true, unchangeably true, that without holiness no man shall see the Lord. "Neither adulterers, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards" shall inherit the kingdom of God. </p><p> Works are "good" only when, (1) they spring from the principle of love to God. The moral character of an act is determined by the moral principle that prompts it. Faith and love in the heart are the essential elements of all true obedience. Hence good works only spring from a believing heart, can only be wrought by one reconciled to God ( Ephesians 2:10 ;  James 2:18:22). ). </p><li> Good works have the glory of God as their object; and (3) they have the revealed will of God as their only rule ( Deuteronomy 12:32 ;  Revelation 22:18 Revelation 22:19 ).  <p> Good works are an expression of gratitude in the believer's heart ( John 14:15 John 14:23 ;  Galatians 5:6 ). They are the fruits of the Spirit ( Titus 2:10-12 ), and thus spring from grace, which they illustrate and strengthen in the heart.  </p><p> Good works of the most sincere believers are all imperfect, yet like their persons they are accepted through the mediation of Jesus Christ ( Colossians 3:17 ), and so are rewarded; they have no merit intrinsically, but are rewarded wholly of grace.  </p> </li>
Worm	<p></p><li> Heb. sas ( Isaiah 51:8 ), denotes the caterpillar of the clothes-moth.  </li><li> The manna bred worms (tola'im), but on the Sabbath there was not any worm (rimmah) therein ( Exodus 16:20 Exodus 16:24 ). Here these words refer to caterpillars or larvae, which feed on corrupting matter.  <p> These two Hebrew words appear to be interchangeable ( Job 25:6 ;  Isaiah 14:11 ). Tola'im in some places denotes the caterpillar ( Deuteronomy 28:39 ;  Jonah 4:7 ), and rimmah, the larvae, as bred from putridity ( Job 17:14 ;  21:26 ;  24:20 ). In  Micah 7:17 , where it is said, "They shall move out of their holes like worms," perhaps serpents or "creeping things," or as in the Revised Version, "crawling things," are meant.  </p><p> The word is used figuratively in  Job 25:6 ;  Psalms 22:6 ;  Isaiah 41:14 ;  <span class="badLink">Mark 9:44</span>  Mark 9:46  Mark 9:48 ;  Isaiah 66:24 .  </p> </li>
Wormwood	<p>Heb. la'anah, the Artemisia absinthium of botanists. It is noted for its intense bitterness ( Deuteronomy 29:18 ;  Proverbs 5:4 ;  Jeremiah 9:15 ;  Amos 5:7 ). It is a type of bitterness, affliction, remorse, punitive suffering. In  Amos 6:12  this Hebrew word is rendered "hemlock" (RSV, "wormwood"). In the symbolical language of the Apocalypse ( Revelation 8:10 Revelation 8:11 ) a star is represented as falling on the waters of the earth, causing the third part of the water to turn wormwood.  </p><p> The name by which the Greeks designated it, absinthion, means "undrinkable." The absinthe of France is distilled from a species of this plant. The "southernwood" or "old man," cultivated in cottage gardens on account of its fragrance, is another species of it. </p>
Worship	<p>homage rendered to God which it is sinful (idolatry) to render to any created being ( Exodus 34:14 ;  Isaiah 2:8 ). Such worship was refused by Peter ( Acts 10:25 Acts 10:26 ) and by an angel ( Revelation 22:8 Revelation 22:9 ).  </p>
Worshipper	<p>(Gr. neocoros = temple-sweeper ( Acts 19:35 ) of the great goddess Diana). This name neocoros appears on most of the extant Ephesian coins  </p>
Wrestle	<p>( Ephesians 6:12 ). See GAMES . </p>
Writing	<p>The art of writing must have been known in the time of the early Pharaohs. Moses is commanded "to write for a memorial in a book" ( Exodus 17:14 ) a record of the attack of Amalek. Frequent mention is afterwards made of writing ( Exodus 28:11 Exodus 28:21 Exodus 28:29 Exodus 28:36 ;  31:18 ;  Exodus 32:15 Exodus 32:16 ;  Exodus 34:1 Exodus 34:28 ;  Exodus 39:6 Exodus 39:14 Exodus 39:30 ). The origin of this art is unknown, but there is reason to conclude that in the age of Moses it was well known. The inspired books of Moses are the most ancient extant writings, although there are written monuments as old as about B.C. 2000. The words expressive of "writing," "book," and "ink," are common to all the branches or dialects of the Semitic language, and hence it has been concluded that this art must have been known to the earliest Semites before they separated into their various tribes, and nations, and families.  </p><p> "The Old Testament and the discoveries of Oriental archaeology alike tell us that the age of the Exodus was throughout the world of Western Asia an age of literature and books, of readers and writers, and that the cities of Palestine were stored with the contemporaneous records of past events inscribed on imperishable clay. They further tell us that the kinsfolk and neighbours of the Israelites were already acquainted with alphabetic writing, that the wanderers in the desert and the tribes of Edom were in contact with the cultured scribes and traders of Ma'in [Southern Arabia], and that the 'house of bondage' from which Israel had escaped was a land where the art of writing was blazoned not only on the temples of the gods, but also on the dwellings of the rich and powerful.", Sayce. (See DEBIR; PHOENICIA .) </p><p> The "Book of the Dead" was a collection of prayers and formulae, by the use of which the souls of the dead were supposed to attain to rest and peace in the next world. It was composed at various periods from the earliest time to the Persian conquest. It affords an interesting glimpse into the religious life and system of belief among the ancient Egyptians. We learn from it that they believed in the existence of one Supreme Being, the immortality of the soul, judgement after death, and the resurrection of the body. It shows, too, a high state of literary activity in Egypt in the time of Moses. It refers to extensive libraries then existing. That of Ramessium, in Thebes, e.g., built by Rameses II., contained 20,000 books.  </p><p> When the Hebrews entered Canaan it is evident that the art of writing was known to the original inhabitants, as appears, e.g., from the name of the city Debir having been at first Kirjath-sepher, i.e., the "city of the book," or the "book town" ( Joshua 10:38 ;  15:15 ;  Judges 1:11 ).  </p><p> The first mention of letter-writing is in the time of David ( 2 Samuel 11:14 2 Samuel 11:15 ). Letters are afterwards frequently spoken of ( 1 Kings 21:8 1 Kings 21:9 1 Kings 21:11 ;  2 Kings  1 Kings 10:1 1 Kings 10:3 1 Kings 10:6 1 Kings 10:7 ;  19:14 ;  2 Chr.  21:12-15 ;  1 Kings 30:1  1 Kings 30:6-9 , etc.).  </p>
Yoke	<p></p><li> Fitted on the neck of oxen for the purpose of binding to them the traces by which they might draw the plough, etc. ( Numbers 19:2 ;  Deuteronomy 21:3 ). It was a curved piece of wood called <i> 'ol</i> . </li><li> In  Jeremiah 27:2 ; 28:10,12the word in the Authorized Version rendered "yoke" is <i> motah</i> , which properly means a "staff," or as in the Revised Version, "bar." <p> These words in the Hebrew are both used figuratively of severe bondage, or affliction, or subjection ( Leviticus 26:13 ;  1 Kings 12:4 ;  Isaiah 47:6 ;  Lamentations 1:14 ;  3:27 ). In the New Testament the word "yoke" is also used to denote servitude ( Matthew 11:29 Matthew 11:30 ;  Acts 15:10 ;  Galatians 5:1 ).  </p></li><li> In 1Sam  1 Samuel 19:21 ,  Job 1:3  the word thus translated is <i> tzemed</i> , which signifies a pair, two oxen yoked or coupled together, and hence in  1 Samuel 14:14  it represents as much land as a yoke of oxen could plough in a day, like the Latin <i> jugum</i> . In  Isaiah 5:10  this word in the plural is translated "acres."   </li>
Yoke-fellow	<p>(Phil  4:3 ), one of the apostle's fellow-labourers. Some have conjectured that Epaphroditus is meant. Wyckliffe renders the phrase "the german felowe", i.e., "thee, germane [=genuine] comrade."  </p>
Zephathah	<p>a valley in the west of Judah, near Mareshah; the scene of Asa's conflict with Zerah the Ethiopian ( 2 Chronicles 14:9-13 ). Identified with the Wady Safieh.  </p>
Zerah	<p>sunrise. </p><li> An "Ethiopian," probably Osorkon II., the successor of Shishak on the throne of Egypt. With an enormous army, the largest we read of in Scripture, he invaded the kingdom of Judah in the days of Asa ( 2 Chronicles 14:9-15 ). He reached Zephathah, and there encountered the army of Asa. This is the only instance "in all the annals of Judah of a victorious encounter in the field with a first-class heathen power in full force." The Egyptian host was utterly routed, and the Hebrews gathered "exceeding much spoil." Three hundred years elapsed before another Egyptian army, that of Necho (B.C. 609), came up against Jerusalem.  </li><li> A son of Tamar ( Genesis 38:30 ); called also Zara ( Matthew 1:3 ).  </li><li> A Gershonite Levite ( 1 Chronicles 6:21 1 Chronicles 6:41 ).   </li>
Zered	<p>=Zared, luxuriance; willow bush, a brook or valley communicating with the Dead Sea near its southern extremity ( Numbers 21:12 ;  Deuteronomy 2:14 ). It is called the "brook of the willows" ( Isaiah 15:7 ) and the "river of the wilderness" ( Amos 6:14 ). It has been identified with the Wady el-Aksy.  </p>
Zereda	<p>the fortress, a city on the north of Mount Ephraim; the birthplace of Jeroboam ( 1 Kings 11:26 ). It is probably the same as Zaretan ( Joshua 3:16 ), Zererath ( Judges 7:22 ), Zartanah ( 1 Kings 4:12 ), or the following.  </p>
Zeredathah	<p>a place in the plain of Jordan; the same as Zarthan ( 2 Chronicles 4:17 ;  1 Kings 7:46 ). Here Solomon erected the foundries in which Hiram made the great castings of bronze for the temple.  </p>
Zererath	<p>( Judges 7:22 ), perhaps identical with Zereda or Zeredathah. Some identify it with Zahrah, a place about 3 miles west of Beth-shean.  </p>
Zeresh	<p>star of Venus, the wife of Haman, whom she instigated to prepare a gallows for Mordecai ( Esther 5:10 ).  </p>
Zeruah	<p>stricken, mother of Jeroboam, the first king of the ten tribes ( 1 Kings 11:26 ).  </p>
Zerubbabel	<p>the seed of Babylon, the son of Salathiel or Shealtiel ( Haggai 1:1 ; Zorobabel,  Matthew 1:12 ); called also the son of Pedaiah ( 1 Chronicles 3:17-19 ), i.e., according to a frequent usage of the word "son;" the grandson or the nephew of Salathiel. He is also known by the Persian name of Sheshbazzar ( Ezra 1:8 Ezra 1:11 ). In the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, he led the first band of Jews, numbering 42,360 ( Ezra 2:64 ), exclusive of a large number of servants, who returned from captivity at the close of the seventy years. In the second year after the Return, he erected an altar and laid the foundation of the temple on the ruins of that which had been destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar ( 3:8-13 ; ch. 4-6). All through the work he occupied a prominent place, inasmuch as he was a descendant of the royal line of David.  </p>
Zeruiah	<p>stricken of the Lord, David's sister, and the mother of Abishai, Joab, and Asahel ( 1 Chronicles 2:16 ), who were the three leading heroes of David's army, and being his nephews, they were admitted to the closest companionship with him.  </p>
Zetham	<p>olive planter, a Levite ( 1 Chronicles 23:8 ).  </p>
Zethan	<p>a Benjamite ( 1 Chronicles 7:10 ).  </p>
Zia	<p>fear, a Gadite ( 1 Chronicles 5:13 ).  </p>
Ziba	<p>post; statue, "a servant of the house of Saul" ( 2 Samuel 9:2 ), who informed David that Mephibosheth, a son of Jonathan, was alive. He afterwards dealt treacherously toward Mephibosheth, whom he slanderously misrepresented to David.  </p>
Zibeon	<p>robber; or dyed. </p><li> A Hivite ( Genesis 36:2 ).  </li><li> A Horite, and son of Seir ( Genesis 36:20 ).   </li>
Zibia	<p>gazelle, a Benjamite ( 1 Chronicles 8:9 ).  </p>
Zibiah	<p>the mother of King Joash ( 2 Kings 12:1 ;  2 Chr  24:1 ).  </p>
Zichri	<p>remembered; illustrious. </p><li> A Benjamite chief ( 1 Chronicles 8:19 ).  </li><li> Another of the same tribe ( 1 Chronicles 8:23 ).   </li>
Ziddim	<p>sides, a town of Naphtali ( Joshua 19:35 ), has been identified with Kefr-Hattin, the "village of the Hittites," about 5 miles west of Tiberias.  </p>
Zidkijah	<p>the Lord is righteous, one who sealed the covenant with Nehemiah ( Nehemiah 10:1 ).  </p>
Zidon	<p>a fishery, a town on the Mediterranean coast, about 25 miles north of Tyre. It received its name from the "first-born" of Canaan, the grandson of Noah ( Genesis 10:15 Genesis 10:19 ). It was the first home of the Phoenicians on the coast of Palestine, and from its extensive commercial relations became a "great" city ( Joshua 11:8 ;  19:28 ). It was the mother city of Tyre. It lay within the lot of the tribe of Asher, but was never subdued ( Judges 1:31 ). The Zidonians long oppressed Israel ( Judges 10:12 ). From the time of David its glory began to wane, and Tyre, its "virgin daughter" ( Isaiah 23:12 ), rose to its place of pre-eminence. Solomon entered into a matrimonial alliance with the Zidonians, and thus their form of idolatrous worship found a place in the land of Israel ( 1 Kings 11:1 1 Kings 11:33 ). This city was famous for its manufactures and arts, as well as for its commerce ( 1 Kings 5:6 ;  1 Chronicles 22:4 ;  Ezekiel 27:8 ). It is frequently referred to by the prophets ( Isaiah 23:2 Isaiah 23:4 Isaiah 23:12 ;  Jeremiah 25:22 ;  27:3 ;  47:4 ;  Ezekiel 27:8 ;  Ezekiel 28:21 Ezekiel 28:22 ;  32:30 ;  Joel 3:4 ). Our Lord visited the "coasts" of Tyre and Zidon = Sidon (q.v.),  Matthew 15:21 ;  Mark 7:24 ;  Luke 4:26 ; and from this region many came forth to hear him preaching ( Mark 3:8 ;  Luke 6:17 ). From Sidon, at which the ship put in after leaving Caesarea, Paul finally sailed for Rome ( Acts 27:3 Acts 27:4 ).  </p><p> This city is now a town of 10,000 inhabitants, with remains of walls built in the twelfth century A.D. In 1855, the sarcophagus of Eshmanezer was discovered. From a Phoenician inscription on its lid, it appears that he was a "king of the Sidonians," probably in the third century B.C., and that his mother was a priestess of Ashtoreth, "the goddess of the Sidonians." In this inscription Baal is mentioned as the chief god of the Sidonians.  </p>
Zif	<p>brightness; splendour; i.e., "the flower month," mentioned only in  1 Kings 6:1 1 Kings 6:37 , as the "second month." It was called Iyar by the later Jews. (See MONTH .) </p>
Ziha	<p>drought. </p><li> The name of a family of Nethinim ( Ezra 2:43 ;  Nehemiah 7:46 ). </li><li> A ruler among the Nethinim ( Nehemiah 11:21 ).   </li>
Ziklag	<p>a town in the Negeb, or south country of Judah ( Joshua 15:31 ), in the possession of the Philistines when David fled to Gath from Ziph with all his followers. Achish, the king, assigned him Ziklag as his place of residence. There he dwelt for over a year and four months. From this time it pertained to the kings of Judah ( 1 Samuel 27:6 ). During his absence with his army to join the Philistine expedition against the Israelites ( 29:11 ), it was destroyed by the Amalekites ( 1 Samuel 30:1 1 Samuel 30:2 ), whom David, however, pursued and utterly routed, returning all the captives ( 1 Samuel 30:26-31 ). Two days after his return from this expedition, David received tidings of the disastrous battle of Gilboa and of the death of Saul ( 2 Samuel 1:1-16 ). He now left Ziklag and returned to Hebron, along with his two wives, Ahinoam and Abigail, and his band of 600 men. It has been identified with 'Asluj, a heap of ruins south of Beersheba. Conder, however, identifies it with Khirbet Zuheilikah, ruins found on three hills half a mile apart, some seventeen miles north-west of Beersheba, on the confines of Philistia, Judah, and Amalek.  </p>
Zillah	<p>shadow, one of the wives of Lamech, of the line of Cain, and mother of Tubal-cain ( Genesis 4:19 Genesis 4:22 ).  </p>

In the later books of the Old Testament this name was sometimes used ( Psalms 87:2 ;  149:2 ;  Isaiah 33:14 ;  Joel 2:1 ) to denote Jerusalem in general, and sometimes God's chosen Israel ( Psalms 51:18 ;  87:5 ).  </p><p> In the New Testament (see SION) it is used sometimes to denote the Church of God ( Hebrews 12:22 ), and sometimes the heavenly city ( Revelation 14:1 ).  </p>

Here Pharaoh was holding his court at the time of his various interviews with Moses and Aaron. "No trace of Zoan exists; Tanis was built over it, and city after city has been built over the ruins of that" (Harper, Bible and Modern Discovery). Extensive mounds of ruins, the wreck of the ancient city, now mark its site ( Isaiah 19:11 Isaiah 19:13 ;  30:4 ; Ezek.  30:14 ). "The whole constitutes one of the grandest and oldest ruins in the world."  </p><p> This city was also called "the Field of Zoan" ( Psalms 78:12 Psalms 78:43 ) and "the Town of Rameses" (q.v.), because the oppressor rebuilt and embellished it, probably by the forced labour of the Hebrews, and made it his northern capital.  </p>

Here Adonijah (q.v.) feasted all the royal princess except Solomon and the men who took part with him in his effort to succeed to the throne. While they were assembled here Solomon was proclaimed king, through the intervention of Nathan. On hearing this, adonijah fled and took refuge in the sanctuary ( 1 Kings 1:49-53 ).
